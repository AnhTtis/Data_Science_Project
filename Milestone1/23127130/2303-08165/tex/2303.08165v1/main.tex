\begin{abstract}
    Let $k * G$ be a crossed product of a division ring $k$ and a torsion-free virtually compact special group $G$. We embed $k * G$ into a division ring $\mathcal D$ and use this to confirm a recent conjecture of Kielak and Linton. In the case where $G$ is locally indicable, we prove that $\mathcal D$ is Hughes-free.
    
    If $H$ is a torsion-free one-relator group, let $\overline{kH}$ be the division ring containing $kH$ constructed by Lewin and Lewin. We prove that $\overline{kH}$ is Hughes-free whenever a Hughes-free $kH$-division ring exists. This is always the case when $k$ is of characteristic zero; in positive characteristic, our previous result implies this happens when $H$ is virtually compact special.

\section{Introduction}


A group $G$ is said to satisfy the \textit{strong Atiyah conjecture} (over $\Q$) if for every free proper cocompact $G$-CW complex $X$, the $L^2$-Betti numbers satisfy $\mathrm{lcm}(G) \cdot b_n^{(2)}(X;G) \in \Z$, where $\mathrm{lcm}(G)$ denotes the least common multiple of the orders of finite subgroups of $G$. We take the statement to be vacuous when $\mathrm{lcm}(G) = \infty$. The strong Atiyah conjecture is open in general, but it has been established for many classes of groups, including residually (torsion-free solvable) groups \cite{SchickIntegrality}, virtually compact special groups \cite{Schreve_AtiyahVCS}, and locally indicable groups \cite{JaikinLopez_Atiyah}.

In the case where $G$ is torsion-free, the strong Atiyah conjecture over $\Q$ is equivalent to the existence of a division ring $\mathcal D_{\Q G}$ such that $\Q G \subseteq \mathcal D_{\Q G} \subseteq \mathcal U(G)$, where $\mathcal U(G)$ is the algebra of operators affiliated to the von Neumann algebra $\mathcal N(G)$. In this case, we always take $\mathcal D_{\Q G}$ to be the division closure of $\Q G$ inside $\mathcal U(G)$, and we call this $\mathcal D_{\Q G}$ the \textit{Linnell skew-field} of $G$. The $L^2$-Betti numbers of $G$ can be computed as $b_n^{(2)}(G) = \dim_{\mathcal D_{\Q G}} H_n(G; \mathcal D_{\Q G})$ (see \cite[Lemma 10.39]{Luck02}). The definitions of $\mathcal N(G)$ and $\mathcal U(G)$ will not be important in this paper, what we want to emphasize is that the Atiyah conjecture is equivalent to the embedding of $\Q G$ in some division ring and that this division ring can be used to compute the $L^2$-Betti numbers of the group.

This point of view on $L^2$-Betti numbers was generalised by Henneke and Kielak in \cite{HennekeKielak_agrarian}, where they consider arbitrary embeddings of integral group rings $\Z G$ into a division ring $\mathcal D$, called agrarian embeddings, and study the agrarian homology $H_\bullet(G, \mathcal D)$ and the resulting agrarian Betti numbers $b_n^\mathcal D(G) := \dim_{\mathcal D} H_n(G; \mathcal D)$. In \cite{JaikinZapirain2020THEUO}, Jaikin-Zapirain showed that many groups $G$ have the property that for all division rings $k$, the group algebra $kG$ embeds into a Hughes-free division ring $\mathcal D_{kG}$ (see \cref{sec:prelims}) and when $k = \Q$ we have $\mathcal D_{kG} = \mathcal D_{\Q G}$. Putting $k = \mathbb F_p$ for a prime $p$ and taking $\mathcal D_{\mathbb F_pG}$-agrarian homology, this leads us to natural mod $p$ analogues of $L^2$-Betti numbers. For instance, in \cite{Fisher_improved} the Betti numbers $b_n^{\mathcal D_{kG}}$ were shown to have many analogous properties to those of $L^2$-Betti numbers, in particular in how they control finiteness properties of kernels of algebraic fibrations and in \cite{FisherHughesLeary_artin} and \cite{AOS_hyperbolization} they were related to the mod $p$ homology growth of $G$.

Very recently, Kielak and Linton proved the following embedding result for virtually compact special hyperbolic groups.
%
\begin{thm}[{\cite[Theorem 1.10]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}}]\label{thm:KLmain}
    Let $H$ be hyperbolic and virtually compact special with $\cd_\Q(H) \geqslant 2$. Then, there exists a finite-index subgroup $L \leqslant H$ and a map of short exact sequences
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            1 \arrow[r] & K \arrow[d, hook] \arrow[r] & L \arrow[d, hook] \arrow[r] & \Z \arrow[d, Rightarrow, no head] \arrow[r] & 1 \\
            1 \arrow[r] & N \arrow[r]                 & G \arrow[r]                 & \Z \arrow[r]                                & 1
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    such that
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item $G$ is hyperbolic, compact special, and contains $L$ as a quasi-convex subgroup.
        \item $\cd_\Q(G) = \cd_\Q(H)$.
        \item $N$ is finitely generated.
        \item If $b_p^{(2)}(H) = 0$ for all $2 \leqslant p \leqslant n$, then $N$ is of type $\FP_n(\Q)$.
        \item If $b_p^{(2)}(H) = 0$ for all $p \geqslant 2$, then $\cd_\Q(N) = \cd_\Q(H) - 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
%
As a consequence of this result, they are able to show among other things that one-relator groups with torsion are virtually free-by-cyclic \cite[Corollary 1.3]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}, confirming a conjecture of Baumslag. Much of Kielak and Linton's paper is written in the full generality of agrarian homology. However, to prove \cref{thm:KLmain}, they need to restrict themselves to $L^2$-homology as they make crucial use of Schreve's result that virtually compact special groups satisfy the Atiyah conjecture \cite{Schreve_AtiyahVCS}. As a consequence, for a torsion-free virtually compact special group $G$, Kielak and Linton can embed the group algebra $\Q G$ into its Linnell-skew field $\mathcal D_{\Q G}$ and use it in homological arguments to prove \cref{thm:KLmain}. At the end of their paper, Kielak and Linton conjecture \cite[Conjecture 6.7]{KielakLinton_FbyZ} that \cref{thm:KLmain} remains true when every instance of $\Q$ is replaced with an arbitrary field $k$ and every $L^2$-Betti number $b_i^{(2)}$ is replaced with the agrarian Betti number $b_i^{\mathcal D_{kG}}$.

The main obstacle to proving \cite[Conjecture 6.7]{KielakLinton_FbyZ} was not having access to a division ring embedding the group algebra $kG$ of a torsion-free virtually compact special group $G$. Our first main result remedies this, building on work of Linnell--Schick \cite{LinnellSchick_AtiyahExt} and Schreve \cite{Schreve_AtiyahVCS}.

\begin{thm}[{\cref{cor:VCSinField}}]\label{thm:VCSinField_intro}
    If $G$ is a torsion-free virtually compact special group and $k$ is a division ring, then any crossed product $k * G$ embeds into a division ring $\mathcal D$. Moreover, if $G$ is locally indicable, then $\mathcal D$ is Hughes-free as a $k * G$-division ring.
\end{thm}

The authors are not aware of the following immediate corollary appearing anywhere in the literature.

\begin{cor}
    If $G$ is a torsion-free virtually compact special group and $k$ is a division ring, then any crossed product $k * G$ satisfies Kaplansky's zero divisor conjecture.
\end{cor}

Using the embedding $kG \hookrightarrow \mathcal D$ given by \cref{thm:VCSinField_intro}, where $G$ is torsion-free virtually compact special, we can reprove \cref{thm:KLmain} over arbitrary fields, thus confirming \cite[Conjecture 6.7]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}.

\begin{thm}[{\cref{thm:KLmain_agr}}]
    Let $k$ be any division ring. Then \cref{thm:KLmain} remains true when every instance of $\Q$ is replaced by $k$ and every $L^2$-Betti number $b_i^{(2)}$ is replaced by the agrarian Betti number $b_i^{\mathcal D_{kG}}$.
\end{thm}

Moreover, Brodski\u{\i} showed that torsion-free one-relator groups are locally indicable \cite{BrodskiiOR}, so \cref{thm:VCSinField_intro} implies the next corollary.

\begin{cor}
    For every virtually compact special one-relator group $G$ and every division ring $k$, any crossed product $k * G$ embeds into a Hughes-free division ring $\mathcal D_{k * G}$.
\end{cor}

In \cite[Theorem 8.2]{Linton_ORH}, Linton showed that every one-relator group $G$ with negative immersions is virtually compact special, and in \cite[Theorem 1.3]{LouderWilton_NegativeImmersions} Louder and Wilton characterise the one-relator groups with negative immersions as those with a presentation $G = F/\llangle R \rrangle$, where $R$ is a cyclically reduced word of primitivity rank $> 2$ (see \cref{def:PR}) in the free group $F$. Since $R$ being of primitivity rank $1$ implies that $G$ has torsion, the only case where we don't know whether $kG$ embeds into a Hughes-free division ring is when $R$ has primitivity rank $2$. Note that in characteristic zero, every torsion-free one-relator group embeds into a Hughes-free division ring \cite[Corollary 1.4]{JaikinLopez_Atiyah}.

Recently, Jaikin-Zapirain showed that if $k$ is a field of characteristic zero and $G$ is a torsion-free one-relator group, then the group algebra $kG$ is coherent (here \textit{coherent} means that every finitely generated ideal is finitely presented) \cite[Theorem 1.1]{Jaikin_oneRelCoherence}. Building on this breakthrough, Linton proved that one-relator groups are coherent \cite{Linton_oneRelCoherent}, confirming a conjecture of Baumslag \cite{Baumslag_OneRelProblems}. In Jaikin-Zapirain's result, the only reason one must assume that $k$ is of characteristic zero is that in this case a Hughes-free division ring $\mathcal D_{kG}$ is known to exist. Thus, combining our construction of $\mathcal D_{kG}$ for $\operatorname{char} k > 0$ and Jaikin-Zapirain's arguments, we obtain the following.

\begin{cor}[\cref{cor:coherence}]
    Let $G$ be a virtually compact special one-relator group. Then the group ring $kG$ is coherent for any division ring $k$.
\end{cor}

By the uniqueness of Hughes-free division rings, we also conclude that every one-relator group with negative immersions embeds into a unique Linnell ring, as defined in \cite[Section 2.3]{Jaikin_oneRelCoherence}. This implies the next corollary.

\begin{cor}
    \cite[Conjecture 1]{Jaikin_oneRelCoherence} holds for virtually compact special locally indicable groups. In particular, it holds for virtually compact special one-relator groups.
\end{cor}

In \cite{LewinLewinORTF}, Lewin and Lewin showed that every group algebra $kG$ of a one-relator group embeds into a division ring $\overline{kG}$. It is thus natural to compare our construction of Hughes-free division rings to the Lewin--Lewin construction. Indeed, in the final section we prove the following general result.

\begin{thm}[{\cref{thm:LL_HF}}]
    Let $G$ be a torsion-free one-relator group and let $k$ be a division ring such that there exists a Hughes-free division ring $\mathcal D_{kG}$. Then $\overline{kG} \cong \mathcal D_{kG}$ as $kG$-division rings.
\end{thm}

As a consequence, the Lewin--Lewin construction $\overline{kG}$ is Hughes-free for all $k$ when $G$ has negative immersions, and it is always Hughes-free when $k$ is of characteristic $0$.


\subsection*{Organisation of the paper}

In \cref{sec:prelims} we recall some preliminaries, including compact special groups and Hughes-free division rings. In \cref{sec:divRings} we prove that group algebras of torsion-free virtually compact special groups embed into a division ring and in \cref{sec:KLconj} we use this to confirm \cite[Conjecture 6.7]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}. Finally, we prove that the Lewin--Lewin construction is Hughes-free whenever a Hughes-free division ring exists in \cref{sec:LL}.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:prelims}

\begin{conv}
    Rings are associative and unital, and ring homomorphisms preserve the unit. If $G$ is a group we will write $e$ for the trivial element.
\end{conv}

\subsection{Special groups}

Special cube complexes were introduced by Haglund and Wise in \cite{HaglundWise_special} as a class of cube complexes that avoid certain pathological hyperplane arrangements. One of the central features of a compact special cube complex $X$ is that it admits a $\pi_1$-injective combinatorial local isometry $X \looparrowright S_\Gamma$ to the Salvetti complex $S_\Gamma$ of the finitely generated right-angled Artin group (RAAG) $A_\Gamma$ (the graph $\Gamma$ is the \textit{hyperplane graph} of $X$) \cite[Theorem 1.1]{HaglundWise_special}. Thus, fundamental groups of compact special cube complexes inherit many remarkable algebraic properties from RAAGs; for example they are subgroups of $\SL_n(\Z)$, and in particular are residually finite.

Throughout the article, we will refer to groups that are fundamental groups of compact special cube complexes as \textit{compact special groups}. Agol's Theorem \cite[Theorem 1.1]{AgolHaken} states that a hyperbolic group $G$ acting properly and cocompactly on a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ cube complex $X$ contains a subgroup $H$ of finite index such that $X/H$ is compact special. In this sense, virtually compact special groups are abundant.


\subsection{Hughes-free division rings}

Let $k$ be a division ring and let $G$ be a group. 

A ring $S$ is $G$-{\it graded} if $S=\bigoplus_{g\in G} S_g$ where $S_g$ is an additive subgroup for every $g\in G$, and $S_gS_h\subseteq S_{gh}$ for all $g,h\in G$. If $S_g$ contains an invertible element $u_g$ for each $g\in G$, then we say that $S$ is a \textit{crossed product} of $S_e$ and $G$ and we shall denote it by $S=S_e * G$. Note that the usual group ring $RG$ of a group $G$ with $R$ a ring is an example of a crossed product.

An $R$-{\it ring} is a pair $(S,\varphi)$ where $\varphi \colon R\rightarrow S$ is a homomorphism. We will often omit $\varphi$ if it is clear from the context. An $R$-division ring $\varphi\colon R\rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ is called {\it epic} if $\varphi(R)$ generates $\mathcal{D}$ as a division ring.

\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a locally indicable group and let $k$ be a division ring. We say that a $k * G$-division ring $\varphi \colon k * G \rightarrow \mathcal D$ is \textit{Hughes-free} if it is epic and the following condition is satisfied: for every non-trivial finitely generated subgroup $H \leqslant G$ and every non-trivial map $f \colon H \rightarrow \Z$, the set $\{\varphi(t)^i : i \in \Z\}$ is linearly independent over the division closure of $k[\ker f]$ in $\mathcal D$, where $t \in H$ is any element such that $f(t) = 1$. In this situation, we will also say that $\mathcal D$ is a \textit{Hughes-free division ring of fractions} of $k * G$.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
    Note that a Hughes-free map $\varphi \colon k * G \rightarrow \mathcal D$ is always an embedding. Indeed, Gr\"ater showed that Hughes-free embeddings are \textit{strongly} Hughes-free \cite[Corollary 8.3]{Grater20}. This means that for every $H \leqslant G$ finitely generated, every $N \trianglelefteqslant H$, and any transversal $T$ of $N$ in $H$, the set $\varphi(T)$ is linearly independent over the division closure of $k * N$ in $\mathcal D$. In particular, the set $\varphi(G)$ is linearly independent over $\varphi(k) \subseteq \mathcal D$, which implies that $\varphi$ is injective.
\end{rem}

Ian Hughes showed that when Hughes-free division rings exist, they are unique up to $k * G$-isomorphism \cite{HughesDivRings1970}. Thus, when it exists, we will always denote the Hughes-free division ring of $k * G$ by $\mathcal D_{k * G}$. If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, note that the division closure of $k * H$ in $\mathcal D_{k*G}$ is Hughes-free as a $k*H$-division ring, and therefore we have a natural inclusion $\mathcal D_{k*H} \subseteq \mathcal D_{k*G}$. Since RAAGs are residually (torsion-free nilpotent) (\cite{Droms_thesis} and \cite{DuchampKrob_RAAGsRTFN}), so are their subgroups, and in particular so are compact special groups. Thus, Hughes-free division rings exist for compact special groups by the following result of Jaikin-Zapirain.

\begin{thm}[{\cite[Theorem 1.1]{JaikinZapirain2020THEUO}}]
    Let $G$ be a locally indicable amenable group, a residually (torsion-free nilpotent) group, or a free-by-cyclic group. Then $\mathcal D_{k * G}$ exists and it is universal.
\end{thm}

See \cref{subsec:slyv} for a definition of universality. We now prove two general Lemmas about Hughes-free division rings which will be useful to us in the later sections.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:twisted_ext}
    Let $G$ be a group and let $H \trianglelefteqslant G$ be a locally indicable normal subgroup. If $k * H$ has a Hughes-free division ring embedding $\varphi \colon k*H \hookrightarrow \mathcal D_{k*H}$, then we can form $\mathcal D_{k*H} * [G/H]$ and there is a natural embedding $k*G \cong (k*H) * [G/H] \hookrightarrow \mathcal D_{k*H} * [G/H]$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    The only potential obstruction to extending the crossed product structure of $(k*H) * [G/H]$ to $\mathcal D_{k*H} * [G/H]$ is extending the conjugation action of $G$ on $H$ to a $G$-action on all of $\mathcal D_{k*H}$. This is not a problem, however, because Hughes-free division rings are unique up to $k*H$-isomorphism. In more detail, let $\alpha \colon H \rightarrow H$ be any automorphism of $H$, and by abuse of notation write $\alpha$ for the induced automorphism of $k*H$. Then $\varphi$ and $\varphi \circ \alpha$ are both Hughes-free embeddings of $k * H$, and by uniqueness of Hughes-free embeddings, $\alpha$ extends to an automorphism $\alpha' \colon \mathcal D_{k*H} \rightarrow \mathcal D_{k*H}$ such that the diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            k*H \arrow[d, "\varphi", hook] \arrow[r, "\alpha", hook] & k*H \arrow[d, "\varphi", hook] \\
            \mathcal D_{k*H} \arrow[r, "\alpha'", hook] & \mathcal D_{k*H}              
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    commutes. \qedhere
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:HF_fi}
    Let $G$ be a locally indicable group and let $H \trianglelefteqslant G$ be a subgroup of finite index. If $\mathcal{D}_{k*H}$ is a Hughes-free division $k*H$-ring of fractions and $\mathcal D_{k*H} * [G/H]$ is a division ring, then $\mathcal D_{k*H} * [G/H]$ is a Hughes-free $k*G$-division ring of fractions.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $L$ be a finitely generated subgroup of $G$ and $N \trianglelefteqslant L$ such that $L/N=\langle tN \rangle \cong \Z$. Since $H\cap N\trianglelefteqslant L$, according to Lemma \ref{lem:twisted_ext} we can form $\mathcal{D}_{k*[H\cap N]} * [L/(H\cap N)]$. Moreover, we have the following natural isomorphism of crossed products
    \begin{align}\label{cross_prod_isom}
        \mathcal{D}_{k*[H\cap N]} * [L/(H\cap N)]&\cong (\mathcal{D}_{k*[H\cap N]} * [N/(H\cap N)]) * [L/N]
    \end{align}
    where $\mathcal{D}_{k*[H\cap N]} * [N/(H\cap N)]$ is obtained by similar considerations. 
    
    Now observe that since the automorphism of $k*[H\cap N]$ used in the construction of the crossed product ring is just a restriction of the conjugation automorphism of $k*H$, we have a natural embedding $\mathcal{D}_{k*[H\cap N]} * [N/(H\cap N)]\hookrightarrow \mathcal D_{k*H} * [G/H]$. Thus $\mathcal{D}_{k*[H\cap N]} * [N/(H\cap N)]$ is a domain because so is $\mathcal D_{k*H} * [G/H]$. Moreover, $|N:H\cap N| \leq |G:H|$ which is finite; so $\mathcal{D}_{k*[H\cap N]} * [N/(H\cap N)]$ is actually a division ring into which $kN$ embeds. 
    
    Let $\mathcal{D}_N$ and $\mathcal{D}_L$ be the division closures of $k*N$ and $k*L$ in $\mathcal{D}_{k*H} * [G/H]$, respectively. Then $\mathcal{D}_{k*[H\cap N]} * [N/(H\cap N)]\cong \mathcal{D}_{N}$ and by (\ref{cross_prod_isom}) the subring of $\mathcal{D}_L$ generated by $\mathcal{D}_N, t$ and $t^{-1}$ has a crossed product ring structure. This shows the $\mathcal{D}_{N}$-independence of the elements $\{t^i| i\in \Z\}$. \qedhere
\end{proof}





\subsection{Agrarian homology}

Let $R$ be a ring, let $G$ be a group and let $\mathcal D$ be a division ring. If the group algebra $RG$ embeds into $\mathcal D$, then we say that $G$ is \textit{$\mathcal D$-agrarian over $R$} and that the embedding $RG \hookrightarrow \mathcal D$ is an \textit{agrarian embedding}. A nice immediate consequence of having an agrarian embedding is that $RG$ satisfies Kaplansky's conjecture on zero-divisors. Note that, as far as the authors are aware, there is not a single example of a torsion-free group and a division ring $k$ such that the group algebra $kG$ does \textit{not} have an agrarian embedding.

Suppose that $G$ is $\mathcal D$-agrarian over $R$. Then $\mathcal D$ is an $RG$-bimodule and we can define the \textit{$\mathcal D$-homology and cohomology} of $G$ by
\[
    H_\bullet (G; \mathcal D) \quad \text{and} \quad H^\bullet (G; \mathcal D)
\]
and the \textit{$\mathcal D$-Betti numbers} by
\[
    b_p^\mathcal D(G) = \dim_{\mathcal D} H_p(G; \mathcal D) \quad \text{and} \quad b_\mathcal D^p(G) = \dim_\mathcal D H^p (G; \mathcal D).
\]
The theory of homological agrarian Betti numbers was introduced by Henneke--Kielak in \cite{HennekeKielak_agrarian} in the case $R = \Z$ and was studied over other fields $R$ in the case where $\mathcal D$ is Hughes-free in \cite{Fisher_improved}. However, in this article we will be mostly concerned with agrarian cohomology. Thanks to \cite[Lemma 2.2]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}, $b_p^\mathcal D(G) = b^p_\mathcal D(G)$ whenever these quantities are finite (which occurs if, for instance, $G$ is of type $\F_\infty$) and therefore we do not need to worry about the distinction between cohomological and homological $\mathcal D$-Betti numbers.

The following is the central example of agrarian homology.

\begin{ex}
    Let $G$ be a torsion-free group satisfying the strong Atiyah conjecture. Then $\Q G$ embeds into a division ring $\mathcal D_{\Q G}$ called the \textit{Linnell skew-field} (\cite{LinnellDivRings93} and \cite[Lemma 10.39]{Luck02}) and the agrarian Betti numbers $b_p^{\mathcal D_{\Q G}}(G)$ are equal to the $L^2$-Betti numbers $b_p^{(2)}(G)$. 
\end{ex}


\begin{prop}\label{prop:props_agr}
    Let $G$ be a group and let $k$ be a division ring such that $kG$ embeds into a division ring $\mathcal D$. Then
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item if $G$ is non-trivial, then $b_0^\mathcal D(G) = 0$;
        \item if $G$ is the fundamental group of a compact aspherical complex $X$, then $\chi(G) = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty b_i^\mathcal D(G)$;
        \item if $\mathcal D = \mathcal D_{kG}$ is Hughes-free, then for every finite index subgroup $H \leqslant G$ we have $|G:H| \cdot b_p^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) = b_p^{\mathcal D_{kH}} (H)$ for all $p$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    (i) This follows from considering the partial free resolution 
    \[
        \bigoplus_{g \in G} kG \xrightarrow{\bigoplus_{g \in G} (g - 1)} kG \xrightarrow{\alpha} k \rightarrow 0
    \]
    of the trivial $kG$-module $k$, and tensoring with $\mathcal D$ over $kG$. Note that $\alpha$ is the augmentation map.

    (ii) This is proved as usual, i.e.~ if $C_\bullet(\widetilde X; k)$ is the CW chain complex of $\widetilde X$ with coefficients in $k$, then we use the fact that $\dim_\mathcal D \mathcal D \otimes_{kG} C_n(\widetilde X)$ is the number of $n$-cells in $X$.

    (iii) This is \cite[Lemma 6.3]{Fisher_improved}. \qedhere
\end{proof}



\subsection{Sylvester matrix rank functions}\label{subsec:slyv}

Let $R$ be a ring. A \textit{Sylvester matrix rank function} $\rk$ on $R$ is a function that assigns a non-negative real number to each matrix over $R$ and satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\rk(A)=0$ if $A$ is any zero matrix and $\rk(1)=1$;
    \item $\rk(AB)\leq \min\{\rk(A),\rk(B)\}$ for any matrices $A$ and $B$ which can be multiplied;
    \item $\rk\left(\begin{array}{cc}
         A & 0 \\
         0 & B
    \end{array}\right)=\rk(A)+\rk(B)$ for any matrices $A$ and $B$;
    \item $\rk\left(\begin{array}{cc}
         A & C \\
         0 & B
    \end{array}\right)\geq \rk(A)+\rk(B)$ for any matrices $A,B$ and $C$ of appropriate sizes.
\end{enumerate}

We denote by $\mathbb{P}(R)$ the set of Sylvester matrix rank functions on $R$. Note that a ring homomorphism $\varphi\colon R\rightarrow S$ induces a map $\varphi^{\#}\colon \mathbb{P}(S)\rightarrow \mathbb{P}(R)$, that is, we can pull back any rank function $\rk$ on $S$ to a rank function $\varphi^{\#}(\rk)$ on $R$ by just setting
\[
\varphi^{\#}(\rk)(A):=\rk(\varphi(A))
\]
for every matrix $A$ over $R$. We shall often abuse the notation and write $\rk$ instead of $\varphi^{\#}(\rk)$ when it is clear that we speak about the rank function on $R$.

A division ring $\mathcal{D}$ has a unique Sylvester matrix rank function which we denote by $\rk_{\mathcal{D}}$. Any Sylvester matrix rank function $\rk$ on $R$ that only takes integer values comes from a division ring by a result of P.~ Malcolmson \cite{Malcolmson}. Furthermore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between integer-valued rank functions and epic $R$-division rings.

\begin{lem}[{\cite[Corollary 3.1.15]{DLopezAlvarezThesis}}]\label{lem:equal_rk}
    Let $R$ be a ring, let $\mathcal{D}$, $\mathcal{E}$ be two epic $R$-division rings. Then $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ are $R$-isomorphic if and only if for every matrix $A$ over $R$ the induced rank functions on $R$ satisfy
    \[
        \rk_{\mathcal{D}}(A)=\rk_{\mathcal{E}}(A).
    \]
\end{lem}

We denote the set of integer-valued rank functions on a ring $R$ by $\mathbb{P}_{div}(R)$.

Given two Sylvester matrix rank functions on $R$, $\rk_1$ and $\rk_2$, we will write $\rk_1\leq \rk_2$ if for every matrix $A$ over $R$, $\rk_1(A)\leq \rk_2(A)$. This partial order structure shall play a key role.

A central notion in this theory is that of a universal $R$-division ring for a given ring $R$ (see, for instance, \cite[Section 7.2]{cohn06FIR}). In the language of Sylvester matrix rank functions, an epic $R$-division ring $\mathcal{D}$ is \textit{universal} if for every $R$-division ring $\mathcal{E}$, $\rk_{\mathcal{D}} \geqslant \rk_{\mathcal{E}}$. Note that the universal epic $R$-division ring, if it exists, is unique up to $R$-isomorphism and we denote it by $U(R)$.  





\section{Division rings for finite extensions of groups with the factorisation property} \label{sec:divRings}

The following definition was introduced by Schreve in \cite{Schreve_AtiyahVCS}, where he used it to show that virtually compact special groups satisfy the strong Atiyah conjecture. This is a strengthening of the \textit{enough torsion-free quotients} property introduced by Linnell and Schick in \cite{LinnellSchick_AtiyahExt}, which they used to study when the Atiyah conjecture passes from a subgroup to a finite index overgroup.

\begin{defn}
    A group $G$ has the \textit{factorisation property} if every homomorphism from $G$ to a finite group factors through a torsion-free elementary amenable quotient.
\end{defn}

The same proof as in \cite[Lemma 4.52]{LinnellSchick_AtiyahExt} works for the next result.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:split_crit}
    Let $Q$ be a finite group in the exact sequence
    \[
        1\rightarrow H\rightarrow G\xrightarrow{\pi} Q\rightarrow 1.
    \]
    Assume that among all normal finite index subgroups of $G$, there is a cofinal system $U_i \trianglelefteqslant G$ with $U_i\subseteq H$, such that for each $i$, the homomorphism $\pi_i$ in 
    \[
        G\xrightarrow{p_i}G/U_i\xrightarrow{\pi_i}Q
    \]
    has a splitting $s_i\colon Q\rightarrow G/U_i$. Then the profinite completion map $\widehat{\pi}\colon \widehat{G}\rightarrow Q$ has a splitting $Q\rightarrow \widehat{G}$.
\end{lem}

For the reader's convenience, we also record the following statement.

\begin{lem}[{\cite[Lemma 3.5]{Schreve_AtiyahVCS}}]\label{lem:collection}
    Suppose $H$ is finitely generated and has the factorisation property. Then there exists a collection $\mathcal{U}$ of subgroups $U\trianglelefteqslant H$ such that every finite index subgroup of $H$ contains a subgroup in $\mathcal{U}$, if $U\in \mathcal{U}$ then $H/U$ is torsion-free and elementary amenable, and if $U,V\in \mathcal{U}$, then $U\cap V\in \mathcal{U}$.
\end{lem}

If $\mathcal U$ is a collection of subgroups of $H \leqslant G$, we shall denote by $\mathcal{U}^G$ the collection $\{U^G\}_{U\in \mathcal{U}}$ where $U^G=\bigcap_{g\in G}gUg^{-1}$.


We restate \cite[Lemma 3.6]{Schreve_AtiyahVCS} with a slight variation.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:split}
    Let $Q$ be a finite group and let $1\rightarrow H\rightarrow G\xrightarrow{\pi} Q\rightarrow 1$ be an exact sequence of groups. Assume $H$ is finitely generated and has the factorisation property. Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a collection of normal subgroups of $H$ as in Lemma \ref{lem:collection}, and define $\mathcal{U}^G$ as above. If each $G/U^G$ has torsion, then there is a non-trivial subgroup $Q_0\leqslant Q$ splitting back to $\widehat{G}_0 \leqslant \widehat{G}$, where $G_0=\pi^{-1}(Q_0)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Since $H/U^G$ is torsion-free, the image of the torsion subgroup of $G/U^G$ in $Q$ has the same order. Denote by $a_U$ the finite collection of non-trivial subgroups of $Q$ which are images of finite subgroups of $G/U^G$ for some $U\in \mathcal{U}$.
    
    Note that if $U,V\in\mathcal{U}$, then each finite subgroup of $G/(U^G\cap V^G)$ maps isomorphically to a finite subgroup of $G/U^G$, since $G/(U^G\cap V^G)$ surjects onto $G/U^G$ with kernel contained in $H/(U\cap V)^G$ which is torsion-free, and similarly for $G/V^G$. In particular, $a_U\cap a_V$ contains $a_{U\cap V}$ and hence it is non-empty. However, $Q$ is finite; thus there is $Q_0\in \bigcap_{U\in \mathcal{U}}a_U$.
    
    This way $Q_0$ is a non-trivial finite group splitting back to $G/U^G$ for all $U^G \in \mathcal{U}^G$. Thus, $Q_0$ splits to the quotient $G/J$ for all $U^G\trianglelefteqslant J\trianglelefteqslant H$. But each finite index $J\trianglelefteqslant H$ contains some $U^G\in\mathcal{U}^G$ by \cref{lem:collection}; so $Q_0$ splits to each finite quotient $G/K$. Therefore, according to Lemma \ref{lem:split_crit}, $Q_0$ splits to $\widehat{G}_0$. \qedhere
\end{proof}

Recall that a group $G$ is \textit{good} (in the sense of Serre) if the restriction 
\[
    H_c^\bullet(\widehat G; M) \rightarrow H^\bullet (G;M)
\]
is an isomorphism for every finite $G$-module $M$, where $\widehat G$ denotes the profinite completion of $G$, and the cohomology on the left is continuous cohomology (see, for example, \cite{Serre_GaloisCohom}).

\begin{thm}\label{thm:USUBGP}
    Let $H$ be a finitely generated good group with the factorisation property and of finite cohomological dimension, and let $1 \rightarrow H \rightarrow G \rightarrow Q \rightarrow 1$ be a group extension with $G$ torsion-free and $Q$ finite. Then there is a normal subgroup $U \trianglelefteqslant G$ such that $U \leqslant H$ and $G/U$ is torsion-free and elementary amenable.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Since $G$ is torsion-free and $H$ is a finite index subgroup, according to \cite[Th\'eor\`eme 1, Section 1.7]{Serre_CohomologyFI} $\cd(H)=\cd(G)$. Moreover, goodness passes through finite index by \cite[Lemma 3.2]{GrunewaldJaikin-ZapirainZalesskii_goodness}. Hence $\cd(\widehat{G})$ is finite; and so $\widehat{G}$ is torsion-free. Therefore, Lemma \ref{lem:split} ends the proof. Indeed, if all quotients $G/U^G$ have torsion, then the splitting of Lemma \ref{lem:split} contradicts the fact that $\widehat{G}$ is torsion-free. Note that $G/U^G$ is elementary amenable due to the exact sequence $1\rightarrow H/U^G\rightarrow G/U^G\rightarrow Q\rightarrow 1$. \qedhere
\end{proof}







\begin{thm}\label{thm:VCS_field}
    Let $H$ be a finitely generated good group with the factorisation property and of finite cohomological dimension, and let $1 \rightarrow H \rightarrow G \rightarrow Q \rightarrow 1$ be a group extension with $G$ torsion-free and $Q$ finite. If $k$ is a division ring such that there is a Hughes-free embedding of $k * H$ into $\mathcal D_{k * H}$, then $k * G$ embeds into a division ring.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    By \cref{thm:USUBGP}, there is a normal subgroup $U \trianglelefteqslant G$ such that $U \leqslant H$ and $G/U$ is torsion-free and elementary amenable. By \cref{lem:twisted_ext}, we can form each of the following rings:
    \[
        \mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U], \quad \mathcal D_{k * U} * [G/U], \quad \mathcal D_{k * H} * [G/H].
    \]
    Since $H/U$ and $G/U$ are elementary amenable, according to \cite[Lemma 2.5]{LinnellSchick_AtiyahExt} $\mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U]$ and $\mathcal D_{k * U} * [G/U]$ are Ore domains and the diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {\mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U]} \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d, hook] & {\mathcal D_{k * U} * [G/U]} \arrow[d, hook] \\
            {\Ore(\mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U])} \arrow[r, hook] &{\Ore(\mathcal D_{k * U} * [G/U])}          
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    commutes. By Hughes-freeness of $\mathcal D_{k * H}$, the map $\mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U] \rightarrow \mathcal D_{k * H}$ is an injection. This implies that $\Ore(\mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U]) \cong \mathcal D_{k * H}$ by the universal property of Ore localisation.

    Consider the following diagram
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = small]
        \mathcal D_{k * H} \arrow[r, "\cong", no head] \arrow[d, hook] & {\Ore(\mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U])} \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d, hook] & {\Ore(\mathcal D_{k * U} * [G/U])} \arrow[d, "\cong", no head] \\
        {\mathcal D_{k * H} *[G/H]} \arrow[r, "\cong", no head]        & {\Ore(\mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U]) * [G/H]} \arrow[r, "\cong", no head]        & {\Ore((\mathcal D_{k * U}*[H/U])*[G/H])} \nospacepunct{.}                    
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    The left two vertical maps are the obvious inclusions and the right vertical map is a standard isomorphism of crossed products. The two left isomorphisms come from the isomorphism $\Ore(\mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U]) \cong \mathcal D_{k * H}$ discussed above. For the bottom right isomorphism, it is not hard to show that the natural map
    \[
        \Ore(\mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U]) * [G/H] \rightarrow \Ore((\mathcal D_{k * U}*[H/U])*[G/H]),
    \]
    is injective. Therefore $\Ore(\mathcal D_{k * U} * [H/U]) * [G/H]$ a domain, which implies it is a division ring since $G/H$ is finite. This proves that $\mathcal D_{k * H} * [G/H]$ is a division ring, which clearly contains $k * G$. \qedhere
\end{proof}



\begin{cor}\label{cor:VCSinField}
    If $G$ is a torsion-free virtually compact special group, then any crossed product $k * G$ embeds into a division ring $\mathcal D$. Moreover, if $H$ is a normal, finite-index, compact special subgroup of $G$, then the diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            k * H \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d, hook] & {k * H * [G/H]} \arrow[d, hook] \arrow[r, "\cong", no head] & k * G \arrow[d, hook] \\
            \mathcal D_{k * H} \arrow[r, hook]    & {\mathcal D_{k * H} * [G/H]} \arrow[r, "\cong", no head]    & \mathcal D        
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    commutes. Moreover, if $G$ is locally indicable, then $\mathcal D = \mathcal D_{k * G}$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
    Compact special groups are good and have the factorisation property \cite[Corollary 4.3]{Schreve_AtiyahVCS}. Moreover, compact special groups are finitely generated and have finite cohomological dimension, since they have finite classifying space. The claim then follows from \cref{thm:VCS_field}. The second claim follows from the proof of \cref{thm:VCS_field}. The final statement follows from \cref{lem:HF_fi}. \qedhere
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    Let $G$ be a torsion-free virtually compact special group and let $k$ be a division ring. Then the Kaplansky zero divisor conjecture holds for any crossed product $k * G$. \qedhere
\end{cor}

In \cite[Theorem 1.1]{Jaikin_oneRelCoherence}, Jaikin-Zapirain proves that $kG$ is coherent whenever $k$ is of characteristic $0$ and $G$ is a torsion-free one-relator group. The only time the assumption that $k$ is of characteristic $0$ is used is to ensure that a Hughes-free division ring $\mathcal D_{kG}$ exists. From Jaikin-Zapirain's arguments and the existence of $\mathcal D_{kG}$ we prove coherence of more one-relator group algebras.

\begin{cor}\label{cor:coherence}
    Let $G$ be a virtually compact special torsion-free one-relator group and let $k$ be any division ring. Then the group algebra $kG$ is coherent.
\end{cor}

Thanks to the work of Linton \cite[Theorem 8.2]{Linton_ORH}, we know that all one-relator groups with negative immersions are virtually compact special. Moreover, Louder and Wilton proved that $G$ has negative immersions if and only if the defining word of $G$ has primitivity rank at least $3$ (see \cref{sec:LL} for more details). In this sense, most one-relator groups are virtually compact special.





\section{The Kielak--Linton conjecture} \label{sec:KLconj}

Let $G$ be a torsion-free virtually compact special group. Since $G$ may not be locally indicable, a Hughes-free division ring $\mathcal D_{kG}$ may not exist. However, by \cref{prop:props_agr}, we may simply define $b_p^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) = \frac{1}{|G:H|} b_p^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H)$, where $H \leqslant G$ is a compact special subgroup of finite-index. We record the following easy observation that will be useful later.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:eitherField}
    Let $k$ be a division ring and let $G$ be a torsion-free virtually compact special group and let $\mathcal D$ be the division ring containing $kG$ constructed in \cref{thm:VCS_field}. Then $b_p^\mathcal D(G) = b_p^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G)$ for all $p$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $H \trianglelefteqslant G$ be a compact special subgroup of finite index. The claim then follows quickly from the definition above and the fact that $\mathcal D \cong \mathcal D_{kH} * [G/H] \cong \bigoplus_{|G:H|}\mathcal D_{kH}$ as $\mathcal D_{kH}$-modules. \qedhere
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}\label{lem:pair_of_free}
    Let $G$ be a non-elementary hyperbolic group, let $k$ be a division ring, and suppose there is an embedding of $kG$ into a division ring $\mathcal D$. Then there exists non-isomorphic quasi-convex free subgroups $A,B \leqslant G$ such that $A$ is malnormal, $A \cap B^g = \{1\}$ for all $g \in G$, and the restriction
    \[
        H^1(G; \mathcal D) \rightarrow H^1(B; \mathcal D)
    \]
    is an isomorphism.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    This is \cite[Corollary 5.7]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}, and the proof is similar: it only relies on an ``agrarian Freiheitssatz" which they prove for arbitrary agrarian embeddings \cite[Theorem 3.1]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}. \qedhere
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:agr_ind}
    Let $G = A*_C$ where $A$ and $C$ are locally indicable and finitely generated. Moreover, suppose that $k$ is such that $\mathcal D_{kA}$ exists and $kG$ embeds into a division ring $\mathcal D \supseteq \mathcal D_{kA}$ making the diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            kA \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d, hook] & kG \arrow[d, hook] \\
            \mathcal D_{kA} \arrow[r, hook]    & \mathcal D
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    commute. If the restriction $H^1(A; \mathcal D_{kA}) \rightarrow H^1(C; \mathcal D_{kA})$ is surjective, then the restriction
    \[
        H^2(G; \mathcal D) \rightarrow H^2(A; \mathcal D)
    \]
    is injective.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $H \leqslant G$ and write $\mathcal D(H)$ for the division closure of $kH$ in $\mathcal D$. Then the proof is the same as in \cite[Proposition 4.8]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}, where one must replace every occurrence of $\mathcal D_{\Q H}$ with $\mathcal D(H)$. \qedhere
\end{proof}

The following proposition corresponds to Proposition 6.4 of \cite{KielakLinton_FbyZ}, where the result is proven in the case $k = \Q$. The obstacle Kielak and Linton faced in their paper was the fact that they didn't have access to division rings containing group rings of torsion-free virtually compact special groups.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:HNN}
    Let $H$ be non-free, torsion-free, hyperbolic, and compact special, and suppose that $b_1^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H) \neq 0$. Then there is a hyperbolic and virtually compact special HNN extension $G = H*_F$ such that the embeddings of $F$ are quasi-convex in $G$ and such that
    \[
        b_p^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) = \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{if} \ p = 1 \\
            b_p^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H) & \text{if} \ p \neq 1.
        \end{cases}
    \]
    Moreover, $H$ is quasi-convex in $G$ and $\cd_k(G) = \cd_k(H)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    By \cref{lem:pair_of_free}, there is a pair of isomorphic free quasi-convex subgroups $A,B \leqslant H$ such that $A$ is malnormal and intersects every conjugate of $B$ trivially and the restriction 
    \[
        H^1(H; \mathcal D_{kH}) \rightarrow H^1(B; \mathcal D_{kH})
    \]
    is an isomorphism.
    
    Now let $f \colon A \rightarrow B$ be any isomorphism and let $G = H*_A$ be the corresponding HNN extension. By \cite[Theorem 6.3]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}, $G$ is virtually compact special. Moreover, since $G$ is the HNN extension of a torsion-free group, it is also torsion-free, and therefore $kG$ embeds in a division ring $\mathcal D$ by \cref{cor:VCSinField}. From \cite[Theorem 3.1]{BieriHNN}, there is a long exact sequence
    \[
        \cdots \rightarrow H^p(G; \mathcal D) \rightarrow H^p(H; \mathcal D) \rightarrow H^p(A; \mathcal D) \rightarrow H^{p+1}(G; \mathcal D) \rightarrow \cdots.
    \]
    Since $A$ is free, $H^p(A; \mathcal D) = 0$ for $p \geqslant 2$, and this immediately implies that $b_p^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) = b_p^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H)$ for $p \geqslant 3$, where we have used \cref{lem:eitherField}.

    The interesting portion of the long exact sequence is then
    \[
        0 \rightarrow H^1(G; \mathcal D) \rightarrow H^1(H; \mathcal D) \rightarrow H^1(A; \mathcal D) \rightarrow H^2(G; \mathcal D) \rightarrow H^2(H; \mathcal D) \rightarrow 0,
    \]
    whence we obtain the equation
    \begin{align*}
        0 &= b_1^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) - b_1^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H) + b_1^{\mathcal D_{kA}}(A) - b_2^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) + b_2^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H) \\
        &= b_1^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) - b_2^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) + b_2^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H).
    \end{align*}
    But $b_2^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) \leqslant b_2^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H)$ by \cref{lem:agr_ind}, so we must have $b_1^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) = 0$ and $b_2^{\mathcal D_{kG}}(G) = b_2^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H)$.

    The claim about cohomological dimensions follows exactly as in the proof of \cite[Proposition 6.4]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}.
\end{proof}

As a consequence, we can reprove \cite[Theorem 1.10]{KielakLinton_FbyZ} over arbitrary fields, thus confirming \cite[Conjecture 6.7]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:KLmain_agr}
    Let $k$ be a division ring and let $H$ be hyperbolic, virtually compact special, and suppose that $\cd_k(H) \geqslant 2$. Then, there exists a finite-index subgroup $L \leqslant H$ and a map of short exact sequences
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            1 \arrow[r] & K \arrow[d, hook] \arrow[r] & L \arrow[d, hook] \arrow[r] & \Z \arrow[d, Rightarrow, no head] \arrow[r] & 1 \\
            1 \arrow[r] & N \arrow[r]                 & G \arrow[r]                 & \Z \arrow[r]                                & 1
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    such that
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
        \item $G$ is hyperbolic, compact special, and contains $L$ as a quasi-convex subgroup.
        \item $\cd_k(G) = \cd_k(H)$.
        \item $N$ is finitely generated.
        \item If $b_p^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H) = 0$ for all $2 \leqslant p \leqslant n$, then $N$ is of type $\FP_n(k)$.
        \item If $b_p^{\mathcal D_{kH}}(H) = 0$ for all $p \geqslant 2$, then $\cd_k(N) = \cd_k(H) - 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}


\begin{proof}
    Now that we have established \cref{prop:HNN} (Kielak and Linton prove the $L^2$ case in \cite[Proposition 6.4]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}), the proof is very similar to the one in \cite{KielakLinton_FbyZ}; consequently, we only show which parts of the $L^2$-theory are used in the proof and provide references for the corresponding statements in the agrarian setting.

    First, Kielak and Linton use the fact that an infinite group has vanishing $0$th $L^2$-Betti number; this is also true in the agrarian setting by \cref{prop:props_agr}(i). Next, they use the fact that $L^2$-Betti numbers scale with the index when passing to finite index subgroups, which is true for agrarian Betti numbers with Hughes-free coefficients by \cref{prop:props_agr}(iii). Finally, they quote \cite[Theorem A]{Fisher_improved} (see \cite[Theorem 6.1]{KielakLinton_FbyZ}), which relates the $L^2$-Betti numbers of compact special groups (and more generally of RFRS groups) to virtual fibring with kernels of type $\FP_n(\Q)$. Luckily, the analogous result holds with agrarian Betti numbers and finiteness properties over arbitrary fields \cite[Theorem B]{Fisher_improved}. \qedhere
\end{proof}


\section{Lewin--Lewin Division Ring and the Hughes-free Condition} \label{sec:LL}

In \cite{LewinLewinORTF} J.~ Lewin and T.~ Lewin showed that for every division ring $k$ and every torsion-free one-relator group $G$, the group algebra $kG$ can be embedded in a division ring, which we denote by $\overline{kG}$ following their notation. They pointed out that they did not know whether $\overline{kG}$ is a universal $kG$-division ring of fractions. However, what they already knew is that if there were a universal $kG$-division ring of fractions, then it would be $\overline{kG}$. In this section we give evidence in this direction by showing that the Lewin--Lewin division ring is Hughes-free for most torsion-free one-relator groups (the meaning of ``most" will be made precise below).


Key algebraic structures in this argument of Lewin--Lewin are firs and semifirs. A non-zero ring $R$ is a {\it free ideal ring} or {\it fir} if every left and every right ideal is a free $R$-module of unique rank. {\it Semifirs} are defined similarly, the only difference being that only ask that finitely generated left and right ideals are free of unique rank (this concept turns out to be left-right symmetric, unlike that of fir). We will make heavy use of the following two powerful theorems of Cohn.

\begin{thm}[\cite{Cohnfreeproducts}]\label{lem:2semifir_semifir}
    The coproduct of a family of semifirs over a common sub-division ring is again a semifir.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[{\cite[Corollary 7.5.14]{cohn06FIR}}]
    Every semifir has a universal division ring of fractions.
\end{thm}

We also record two useful results for future reference.

\begin{lem}[\cite{Cohnfreeprodskewfields}]\label{lem:univ_equality}
    Let $R_1,R_2$ be semifirs with a common division subring $\mathcal{D}$. Then $U(R_1 *_{\mathcal{D}} R_2)\cong U(R_1 *_{\mathcal{D}} U(R_2))$.
\end{lem}

\begin{prop}[{\cite[Theorem 8.1]{JaikinLopez_Atiyah}}]\label{prop:rk_max_HF}
    Let $G$ be a locally indicable group $G$ and assume there exists a Hughes-free $kG$-division ring $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$. Then the Sylvester matrix rank function $\rk_{\mathcal{D}_{kG}}$ is maximal in $\mathbb{P}_{div}(kG).$
\end{prop}

\begin{rem}
    Note that \cref{prop:rk_max_HF} does not imply that Hughes-free division rings are necessarily universal, since different rank functions may not be comparable.
\end{rem}

We now prove two general lemmas about Hughes-free division rings which will be used right afterwards.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:HF_amalg}
    Let $G$ be a locally indicable group which is the amalgam of $G_1$ and $G_2$ over $H$. If $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$ exists, then
    \[
        U(\mathcal{D}_{kG_1} *_{\mathcal{D}_{kH}} \mathcal{D}_{kG_2})\cong \mathcal{D}_{kG}
    \]
    as $kG$-rings.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    First note that by uniqueness of Hughes-free division rings, the coproduct $\mathcal{D}_{kG_1} *_{\mathcal{D}_{kH}} \mathcal{D}_{kG_2}$ is well-defined. Moreover, it is a semifir and thus has a universal division ring. On the other hand, we have natural embeddings of $\mathcal{D}_{kG_1}$, $\mathcal{D}_{kH}$, $\mathcal{D}_{kG_2}$ into $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$. Thus by universal property of coproducts we have the following commutative diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            kG \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d, hook] & {\mathcal{D}_{kG_1} *_{\mathcal{D}_{kH}} \mathcal{D}_{kG_2}} \arrow[d, hook] \arrow[dl]\\
            \mathcal{D}_{kG}   & U(\mathcal{D}_{kG_1} *_{\mathcal{D}_{kH}} \mathcal{D}_{kG_2}) \nospacepunct{.}  
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    Let $\rk_{U(G)}$ and $\rk_G$ denote the Sylvester matrix rank functions on $\mathcal D_{kG_1} *_{\mathcal D_{kH}} \mathcal D_{kG_2}$ corresponding to $U(\mathcal{D}_{kG_1} *_{\mathcal{D}_{kH}} \mathcal{D}_{kG_2})$ and $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$, respectively. Then $\rk_{U(G)}\geq \rk_{G}$ by universality. 
    
    On the other hand, $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$ is Hughes-free and hence $\rk_{G}$ is a maximal rank function on $kG$. Thus, $\rk_{U(G)} = \rk_{G}$ on $kG$ by \cref{prop:rk_max_HF}. Since $kG$ embeds in both division rings epically, they are $kG$-isomorphic by \cref{lem:equal_rk}. \qedhere
\end{proof}



\begin{lem}\label{lem:HF_cyclic}
    Let $G$ be a locally indicable group and $N\trianglelefteqslant G$ be a normal subgroup such that $G/N=\langle tN \rangle \cong \Z$. If $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$ is a Hughes-free $kG$-division ring of fractions, then 
    $$\mathcal{D}_{kG}\cong \Ore(\mathcal{D}_{kN}[t^{\pm 1};\tau])$$
    as $kG$-rings.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    First note that since $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$ is a Hughes-free division ring, the integers powers of $t$ are $\mathcal{D}_{kN}$-linearly independent. Hence, if we set $S$ for the subring of $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$ generated by $\mathcal{D}_{kN}, t$ and $t^{-1}$, we get an isomorphism $S\cong \mathcal{D}_N[t^{\pm 1};\tau]$ where $\tau$ denotes the twisted action of $t$ on $\mathcal D_{kN}$ induced by conjugation. Note that $S$ is an Ore domain. Thus by universal property of localization we have the following commutative diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
             \Ore(\mathcal{D}_N[t^{\pm 1};\tau]) \arrow[rr, hook] &&  \mathcal{D}_{kG}\\
            &kG \arrow[ul, hook'] \arrow[ur, hook]   &    
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    Finally, since both embeddings are epic, we conclude that $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$ and $\Ore(\mathcal{D}_N[t^{\pm 1};\tau])$ are $kG$-isomorphic.\qedhere
\end{proof}

We are ready to show the main theorem of this section.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:LL_HF}
    Let $G$ be a torsion-free one-relator group and let $k$ be a division ring such that there exists the Hughes-free $kG$-division ring of fractions $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$. Then 
    $$\overline{kG}\cong \mathcal{D}_{kG}$$
    as $kG$-rings.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    The plan of the proof is to follow the Lewin--Lewin construction of $\overline{kG}$ and use our assumption that $\mathcal D_{kG}$ exists to prove that $\overline{kG} \cong \mathcal D_{kG}$. Crucially, we recall Brodski\u{\i}'s result that torsion-free one-relator groups are locally indicable \cite{BrodskiiOR}. Let $G=\langle a_1, a_2,\ldots \mid R \rangle$ be a torsion-free one-relator group, where $R$ is a cyclically reduced word in the generators $a_i$. 
    
    We argue, as in \cite{LewinLewinORTF}, by induction on the complexity of $R$, where the complexity is defined to be the length of $R$ minus the number of generators appearing in $R$. If $R$ has complexity $0$, then $G$ is free, in which case the Lewin--Lewin construction is just the universal division ring of fractions $U(kG)$ (which exists due to \cite{Cohnfreeproducts}). But also $U(kG) \cong \mathcal D_{kG}$ for $G$ free (see, e.g., \cite[Theorem 1.1]{JaikinZapirain2020THEUO}).
    
    Now assume the complexity is greater than zero. We also assume that every generator appears in $R$. Otherwise $G$ decomposes as a free product $H * F$, where $H = \langle a_1, \dots, a_n \mid R \rangle$ with $R$ involving all the generators $a_1, \dots, a_n$ and $F$ is a free group. In this case, the Lewin--Lewin construction is $\overline{kG} = U(\overline{kH} * U(kF))$. Assuming the result for $H$, we conclude that $\overline{kG} \cong \mathcal D_{kG}$ by \cref{lem:HF_amalg}. We also assume that $R$ involves a generator of exponent sum zero, and explain how to reduce to this case at the end of the proof. Without loss of generality, suppose that $t = a_1$ has exponent sum zero, and let $N$ be the normal subgroup generated by the elements $a_i$ for $i \geqslant 2$. Note that $N$ splits as a line of groups
    \[
        \cdots * N_{i-1} *_{A_{i-1,i}} N_i *_{A_{i,i+1}} N_{i+1} * \cdots 
    \]
    where each $N_i$ is a one-relator group with relator of complexity strictly less than that of $R$ and each $A_{i-1,i}$ is a free group (see \cite[Section 5]{LewinLewinORTF}). By induction, each ring $kN_i$ embeds into a Hughes-free division ring $\mathcal D_{kN_i}$, and by uniqueness of Hughes-free division rings we can form the following line of division rings
    \[
        C = \cdots * \mathcal D_{kN_{i-1}} *_{\mathcal D_{kA_{i-1,i}}} \mathcal D_{kN_i} *_{\mathcal D_{kA_{i,i+1}}} \mathcal D_{kN_{i+1}} * \cdots 
    \]
    which is a semifir by Cohn's theorem, and it naturally contains the group ring
    \[
        kN \cong \cdots * kN_{i-1} *_{kA_{i-1,i}} kN_i *_{kA_{i,i+1}} kN_{i+1} * \cdots.
    \]
    There is thus a universal division ring of fractions $U(C)$. We can also construct a division ring $\mathcal D$ embedding $kN$ as the direct limit of the system 
    \[
        \{U(\mathcal{D}_{kN_{-i}} *_{\mathcal{D}_{kA_{-i,-i+1}}}\ldots *_{\mathcal{D}_{kA_{i-1,i}}} \mathcal{D}_{kN_{i}})\}_{i\in \N}
    \]
    of Hughes-free division rings by Lemma \ref{lem:HF_amalg}. Note $\mathcal D$ is Hughes-free as a $kN$-division ring and therefore $\mathcal D = \mathcal D_{kN}$ coincides with the division closure of $kN$ in $\mathcal D_{kG}$. Thus, we have the following commutative diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            kN \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d, hook] & C \arrow[d, hook]\arrow[dl, hook]\\
            \mathcal{D}_{kN}   & U(C)    
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    So again combining universality and maximality of rank functions first over $C$ and then over $kN$ as in the proof of \cref{lem:HF_amalg}, it follows that $\mathcal{D}_{kN}$ and $U(C)$ are $kN$-isomorphic. In particular, $U(C)$ is Hughes-free. Finally, the Lewin--Lewin division ring is the Ore localization of $U(C)[t^{\pm 1};\tau]$, which according to Lemma \ref{lem:HF_cyclic} is $kG$-isomorphic to the Hughes-free $kG$-division ring of fractions $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$. This concludes the proof of the case where $R$ involves a generator with exponent sum zero.

    Suppose now that $R$ involves no generator with exponent sum zero. If this is the case, then by \cite[Proposition 2]{LewinLewinORTF} the one relator group $H := G * \Z$ can be given a one-relator presentation where the cyclically reduced word has complexity strictly less than that of $R$. By induction, we conclude that $\overline{kH} = \mathcal D_{kH}$. Lewin--Lewin set $\overline{kG}$ to be the division closure of $kG$ inside $\overline{kH}$, and this is just $\mathcal D_{kG}$. \qedhere 
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
    The above proof shows that the Lewin--Lewin construction can be further extended to crossed products $k * G$.
\end{rem}

The existence of such Hughes-free division ring for locally indicable groups over a characteristic $0$ field was proved in \cite[Corollary 1.4]{JaikinLopez_Atiyah} as a corollary of the strong Atiyah conjecture over $\mathbb C$ for locally indicable groups. Thus, in characteristic zero, we conclude that the Lewin--Lewin construction is Hughes-free.

\begin{cor}
    Let $G$ be a torsion-free one-relator group and let $k$ be a field of characteristic $0$. Then $\overline{kG}$ is Hughes-free.
\end{cor}

\begin{defn}\label{def:PR}
    The \textit{primitivity rank} of a word $w$ in a free group $F$ is the minimal rank of a subgroup $K$ containing $w$ such that $w$ is imprimitive in $K$ (we define the primitivity rank to be $\infty$ if there is no such $K$).
\end{defn}

Note that words of primitivity rank $1$ are exactly the proper powers. Over arbitrary coefficients, we conclude the following.

\begin{cor}
    Let $G = F/\llangle R \rrangle$ be a torsion-free one-relator group, and suppose $R$ has primitivity rank at least $3$. Then $\overline{kG}$ is Hughes-free for any division ring $k$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
    Louder and Wilton proved that $G$ has negative immersions if and only if $R$ has primitivity rank at least $3$ \cite[Theorem 1.3]{LouderWilton_NegativeImmersions} and Linton showed that one-relator groups with negative immersions are virtually compact special \cite[Theorem 8.2]{Linton_ORH}. Thus, $\mathcal D_{kG}$ exists by \cref{cor:VCSinField} and \cref{lem:HF_fi}, and by \cref{thm:LL_HF} $\overline{kG} \cong \mathcal{D}_{kG}$.
\end{proof}

We conclude with the following natural question. By the previous corollaries, it is settled in the affirmative in characteristic $0$, and only the primitivity rank $2$ case remains in characteristic $p > 0$.

\begin{q}
    Is the Lewin--Lewin construction always Hughes-free?

In order to show the above theorem we heavily use the well known fact that torsion-free one-relator groups are locally indicable established in \cite{BrodskiiOR}. To begin with we recall the construction of the Lewin--Lewin division ring. Let 
\[
    G=\langle a_1, a_2,\ldots| R(a_1,\ldots, a_n)\rangle
\]
be a torsion-free one-relator group. Assume that all generators appear in $R$, for otherwise we have $G = H * F$ where $H=\langle a_1,\ldots, a_n| R(a_1,\ldots, a_n)\rangle$. However, for any division ring $k$ and a free group $F$, crossed products $kF$ are coproducts of principal ideal domains, and hence semifirs; thus taking crossed product of semifirs, they are reduced to show an embedding for $H$. Nevertheless, this does not present a real difficult for us, since  by hypothesis the group $G$ we shall be working with is already known to have a Hughes-free $kG$-division ring of fractions; and hence by Lemma \ref{lem:HF_amalg} the Lewin--Lewin division ring is Hughes-free too. So let us keep on with this assumption and work by induction on complexity as in \cite{LewinLewinORTF}.

If $R(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ has complexity zero, then $G$ is a free group and $\overline{kG}$ is given by the semifir structure, which is Hughes-free by \cite[Theorem 1 \& 2]{Lewinfree} .

On the other hand, if the complexity of $R$ is greater than zero, then the existence of such division ring for $kG$ splits in two cases: either $G$ has a relator with exponent sum zero on some letter or not. The former case reduces to the first as follows. Since $G$ is a torsion-free group, $R(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ is not a proper power. So according to \cite[Proposition 2]{LewinLewinORTF} there is a torsion-free one-realtor group $H=G * G_1$ with $G_1=\langle t \rangle$ cyclic, defining relator of exponent sum $0$ on $t$ and appropriate complexity in the sense that $\mathcal{D}_{kH}$ exists once the zero exponent case is done. Therefore, they set $\overline{kG}$ as the division closure of $kG$ inside $\mathcal{D}_{kH}$. However, since Hughes-free is a property that passes to subgroups, we are once again reduced to show that the Lewin--Lewin division ring is Hughes-free for groups with defining relator having exponent sum zero on some letter.

For the exponent sum zero case we shall give a Hughes-free division ring, with a construction in the same spirit as in Lewin--Lewin, and show that it is in fact isomorphic to $\overline{kG}$. First assume that the complexity of $R$ is greater than zero, that it also has exponent sum zero on some letter and that torsion-free one-relator groups whose defining relator has smaller complexity than that of $R$ embed into a Hughes-free $kG$-division ring of fractions. Although the stronger assumption of Hughes-free is not originally stated in \cite{LewinLewinORTF}, it can be done by the complexity zero case. Now we relabel the generators as $t,x,y,\ldots, z$ so that $R(t,x,y,\ldots, z)$ has exponent sum zero on $t$. Let $N$ be the normal closure in $G$ of $\{x,y,\ldots,z\}$. Then $N$ can be seen as the direct limit of a tree of groups $(\mathcal{N},T)$, where $T$ is a tree whose vertices are subgroups $N_i$ of less complexity, one for each integer $i$, and with an edge joining $i$ and $i+1$ by a free group $A_{i,i+1}$ for each $i$ (see \cite[Section 5]{LewinLewinORTF}). Since our group is locally indicable, the uniqueness of the Hughes-free division ring allows us to form a tree of division rings $(\overline{\mathcal{N}},T)$ given by
$$\begin{tikzcd}
            &\mathcal{D}_{kN_{i-1}} && \mathcal{D}_{kN_{i}}&&\mathcal{D}_{kN_{i+1}}& \\
            \ldots &kN_{i-1}\arrow[u,hook]&\mathcal{D}_{kA_{i-1,i}}\arrow[ul,hook']\arrow[ur,hook]& kN_{i}\arrow[u,hook]&\mathcal{D}_{kA_{i,i+1}}\arrow[ur,hook]\arrow[ul,hook']&kN_{i+1}\arrow[u,hook]&\ldots \\
            &&kA_{i-1,i}\arrow[ur,hook]\arrow[ul,hook']\arrow[u,hook]&&kA_{i,i+1}\arrow[ur,hook]\arrow[ul,hook']\arrow[u,hook]&&
        \end{tikzcd}$$
Now we define $C$ as the direct limit of the system $(\overline{\mathcal{N}},T)$, which is a semifir in which $kN$ embeds by \cite[Theorem 1]{LewinLewinORTF}. Thus $kN$ embeds into the universal division ring $U(C)$ given by the semifir structure. However, by \cref{lem:univ_equality} we can also construct $\mathcal{D}$ as the direct limit of the system $\{U(\mathcal{D}_{kN_{-i}} *_{\mathcal{D}_{kA_{-i,-i+1}}}\ldots *_{\mathcal{D}_{kA_{i-1,i}}} \mathcal{D}_{kN_{i}})\}_{i\in \N}$ of Hughes-free division rings due to Lemma \ref{lem:HF_amalg}. Note also that $\mathcal{D}$ is a Hughes-free division $kN$-ring of fractions and hence it is $kN$-isomorphic to $\mathcal{D}_{kN}$, the division closure of $kN$ in $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$. Thus we have the following commutative diagram
$$\begin{tikzcd}
            kN \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d, hook] & C \arrow[d, hook]\arrow[dl, hook]\\
            \mathcal{D}_{kN}   & U(C)    
        \end{tikzcd}$$
So again combining universality and maximality of rank functions first over $C$ and then over $kN$ as in the proof of \cref{lem:HF_amalg}, it follows that $\mathcal{D}_{kN}$ and $U(C)$ are $kN$-isomorphic. In particular, $U(C)$ is Hughes-free. Finally, the Lewin--Lewin division ring is the Ore localization of $U(C)[t^{\pm 1};\tau]$, which according to Lemma \ref{lem:HF_cyclic} is $kG$-isomorphic to the Hughes-free $kG$-division ring of fractions $\mathcal{D}_{kG}$. 
This concludes the proof of \cref{thm:LL_HF}.

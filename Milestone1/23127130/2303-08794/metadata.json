    "abstract": "We study the equivariant concordance classes of two-bridge knots, providing an easy formula to compute their butterfly polynomial, and we give two different proofs that no two-bridge knot is equivariantly slice. Finally, we introduce a new invariant of equivariant concordance for strongly invertible knots. Using this invariant as an obstruction we strengthen the result on two-bridge knots, proving that their equivariant concordance order is always infinite.",

\makecell{Extract the medical temporal constraints from the following drug usage guideline.} \\

\makecell{\textit{Guided}} & 
\makecell{Extract the medical temporal constraints from the following drug usage guideline. \\ Use the medical temporal constraint format as defined by the context free grammar \\ below, and pay attention to the examples. \\ The context free grammar contains the following set of terminals ... \\ ... Using these terminals, medical temporal constraints can be expressed using \\ the following nonterminals ... \\ ... Normalize all activities, if similar enough, into the following list of activities: ... } \\
\hline
\makecell{\textit{Specialized}} & 
\makecell{Extract all imprecise dependency medical temporal constraints from the following samples. \\ An imprecise dependency medical temporal constraint is any instruction to take medication \\ before, while, or after another activity. MTCs are of the form X\_Y, where X is one of \\ \{before, after, while\}, and Y is an activity.} \\

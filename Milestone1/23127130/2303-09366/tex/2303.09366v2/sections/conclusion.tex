\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we have developed a novel taxonomy of potential MTCs and a novel CFG based model to computationally represent MTCs found in unstructured DUGs. We present and release three new datasets containing $N=836$ DUGs with labeled normalized MTCs. Finally, guided by recent work in ICL for medical information extraction, we develop and explore an ICL solution for the MTC extraction task, achieving an average F1 score of $0.62$ across all datasets. Patient-in-the-loop systems that utilize MTC extraction will have computational representations of patient constraints to guide patient activity, promote medication adherence, and lead to better health outcomes. The taxonomy and CFG of MTCs, dataset of extracted MTCs, and ICL exploration presented in this work will advance patient-centric healthcare applications for treatment adherence.

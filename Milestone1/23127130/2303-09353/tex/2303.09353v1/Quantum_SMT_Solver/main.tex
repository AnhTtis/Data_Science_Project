\begin{abstract}
% Satisfiability modulo theory (SMT), a problem of determining the satisfiability of a first-order formula with respect to a decidable first-order theory, has a wide range of applications because of its powerful ability of problem encoding. Given a SMT formula $F$, the classical lazy approach for SMT solving tries to (1) abstract $F$ to a Boolean formula $F_B$, (2) find a Boolean solution to $F_B$, and (3) check whether the Boolean solution is consistent with the theory. If the solution is not consistent, the SMT solver needs to perform steps (2) and (3) back and forth until a consistent solution is found. This classical approach becomes unscalable when the search space is huge. In this work, we develop a quantum SMT solver based on Grover's algorithm to solve formulas of the bit-vector theory. With the characteristic of superposition in quantum computing, our solver is able to consider all the inputs simultaneously and check their consistency between Boolean and the theory domains in one shot, which brings significant speed-up for SMT solving.

Steps~{(2)} and (3) may need to be performed back and forth until a consistent solution is found. In this work, we develop a quantum SMT solver for the bit-vector theory. With the characteristic of superposition in quantum system, our solver is able to consider all the inputs simultaneously and check their consistency between Boolean and the theory domains in one shot.

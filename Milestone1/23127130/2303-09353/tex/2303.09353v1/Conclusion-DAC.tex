\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a quantum SMT solver for the $\mathcal{BV}$ theory, based on Grover’s algorithm. 
Our proposed approach not only provides a theoretically quadratic speedup compared to the traditional method, but also has the capability of discovering all solutions. 
Since solving SMT problems for other theories also consists of two parts (namely SAT and theory solving), our proposed oracle construction is general to be extended to other theories, which is our future work.

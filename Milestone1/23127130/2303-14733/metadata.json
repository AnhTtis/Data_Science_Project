    "abstract": "In this paper, a randomized gossip-type matrix-weighted consensus algorithm is proposed for both leaderless and leader-follower topologies. Under some mild assumptions, the proposed pairwise asynchronous update algorithm achieves a consensus in expectation. Moreover, the probability distribution, the weighting matrices, and the updating step size jointly determine the upper bound of the $ε$-convergence time of the algorithm. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to the bearing-based network localization problem. The theoretical result is supported by several numerical examples.",

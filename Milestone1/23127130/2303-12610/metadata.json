    "abstract": "We propose distributed iterative algorithms for safe control design and safety verification for networked multi-agent systems. These algorithms rely on distributing a control barrier function (CBF) related quadratic programming (QP) problem. The proposed distributed algorithm addresses infeasibility issues of existing schemes by dynamically allocating auxiliary variables across iterations. The resulting control input is guaranteed to be optimal, and renders the system safe. Furthermore, a truncated algorithm is proposed to facilitate computational implementation. The performance of the truncated algorithm is evaluated using a distributed safety verification algorithm. The algorithm quantifies safety for a multi-agent system probabilistically, using a certain locally Lipschitz continuous feedback controller by means of CBFs. Both upper and lower bounds on the probability of safety are obtained using the so called scenario approach. Both the scenario sampling and safety verification procedures are fully distributed. The efficacy of our algorithms is demonstrated by an example on multi-robot collision avoidance.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that lipid membranes respond to a threshold transmembrane electric field through a reversible mechanism called electroporation, where hydrophilic water pores form across the membrane, an effect widely used in biological systems. The effect of such fields on interfacially-confined (stacked or supported) lipid membranes, on the other hand, which may strongly modulate interfacial properties, has not to our knowledge been previously studied. Motivated by recent surface forces experiments showing a striking effect of electric fields on lubrication by confined lipid bilayers, we carried out all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of such membranes under transverse electric fields. We find that in addition to electroporation, a new feature emerges of locally merged bilayers which act to bridge the confining interfaces. These features shed light on the remodelling of confined lipid membrane stacks by electric fields, and provides insight into how such fields may modulate frictional and more generally surface interactions in the presence of lipid-based boundary layers.",

abstract = {This paper investigates an asset allocation problem for defined contribution pension funds with stochastic income and mortality risk under a multi-period mean–variance framework. Different from most studies in the literature where the expected utility is maximized or the risk measured by the quadratic mean deviation is minimized, we consider synthetically both to enhance the return and to control the risk by the mean–variance criterion. First, we obtain the analytical expressions for the efficient investment strategy and the efficient frontier by adopting the Lagrange dual theory, the state variable transformation technique and the stochastic optimal control method. Then, we discuss some special cases under our model. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the results obtained in this paper.}

Optimality of investment decisions is built on the so-called forward investment performance criteria and, in particular, on the time-monotone ones. It is shown that for this class of forward criteria the desired initial allocations completely characterize the future optimal investment strategies. The analysis uses the connection between a nonlinear equation, satisfied by the local risk tolerance, and the backward heat equation. Complete solutions are provided as well as various examples. }

abstract = {Abstract We introduce the concept of forward rank-dependent performance criteria, extending the original notion to forward criteria that incorporate probability distortions. A fundamental challenge is how to reconcile the time-consistent nature of forward performance criteria with the time-inconsistency stemming from probability distortions. For this, we first propose two distinct definitions, one based on the preservation of performance value and the other on the time-consistency of policies and, in turn, establish their equivalence. We then fully characterize the viable class of probability distortion processes and provide the following dichotomy: it is either the case that the probability distortions are degenerate in the sense that the investor would never invest in the risky assets, or the marginal probability distortion equals to a normalized power of the quantile function of the pricing kernel. We also characterize the optimal wealth process, whose structure motivates the introduction of a new, ‘distorted’ measure and a related market. We then build a striking correspondence between the forward rank-dependent criteria in the original market and forward criteria without probability distortions in the auxiliary market. This connection also provides a direct construction method for forward rank-dependent criteria. Finally, our results on forward rank-dependent performance criteria motivate us to revisit the classical (backward) setting. We follow the so-called dynamic utility approach and derive conditions for existence and a construction of dynamic rank-dependent utility processes.},

The equity-linked contingent claim depends on, not only the future lifetime of the policyholder, but also the performance of the reference portfolio in the financial market for the segregated account of the policyholder. For both zero volatility and non-zero volatility forward utility preferences, prices and hedging strategies of the contract are represented by solutions of random horizon backward stochastic differential equations. Numerical illustration is provided for the zero volatility case. The derived prices and hedging strategies are also compared with classical results in the literature.}

We use this simple rule to investigate how transaction costs and borrowing constraints affect portfolio insurance-type strategies. Absent transaction costs, CPPI is equivalent to investing in perpetual American call options, and is optimal for a piecewise-HARA utility function with a minimum consumption constraint. As the multiple increases, the payoffs under CPPI approach those of a stop-loss strategy. The expected holding-period return is not monotonic in the multiple, and a higher expected return can be obtained under CPPI than with a stop-loss strategy.}

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we study the optimal investment and reinsurance problem of an insurance company whose investment preferences are described via a forward dynamic exponential utility in a regime-switching market model. Financial and actuarial frameworks are dependent since stock prices and insurance claims vary according to a common factor given by a continuous time finite state Markov chain. We construct the value function and we prove that it is a forward dynamic utility. Then, we characterize the optimal investment strategy and the optimal proportional level of reinsurance. We also perform numerical experiments and provide sensitivity analyses with respect to some model parameters.},

abstract = {We introduce stochastic utilities such that utility of any fixed amount of interest is a stochastic process or random variable. Also, there exist stochastic (or random) subsistence and satiation levels associated with stochastic utilities. Then, we consider optimal consumption, life insurance purchase and investment strategies to maximize the expected utility of consumption, bequest and pension with respect to stochastic utilities. We use the martingale approach to solve the optimization problem in two steps. First, we solve the optimization problem with an equality constraint which requires that the present value of consumption, bequest and pension is equal to the present value of initial wealth and income stream. Second, if the optimization problem is feasible, we obtain the explicit representations of the replicating life insurance purchase and portfolio strategies. As an application of our general results, we consider a family of stochastic utilities which have hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA).}

Similar questions are also addressed starting directly from the initial investment choice. In parallel we study so-called forward investment-consumption criteria with the dynamic property that their volatility component is identically zero. We provide a fully forward characterization of such criteria and use it to construct forward preferences. We also provide explicit formulas for the associated optimal strategies and characterize the class of criteria which may be decomposed into a pure forward investment criterion and an infinite horizon Merton problem. }

abstract = {In this paper, we assume that the surplus process of an insurance entity is represented by a pure diffusion. The company can invest its surplus into a Black–Scholes risky asset and a risk free asset. We impose investment restrictions that only a limited amount is allowed in the risky asset and that no short-selling is allowed. We further assume that when the surplus level becomes negative, the company can borrow to continue financing. The ultimate objective is to seek an optimal investment strategy that minimizes the probability of absolute ruin, i.e. the probability that the liminf of the surplus process is negative infinity. The corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is analyzed and a verification theorem is proved; applying the HJB method we obtain explicit expressions for the S-shaped minimal absolute ruin function and its associated optimal investment strategy. In the second part of the paper, we study the optimization problem with both investment and proportional reinsurance control. There the minimal absolute ruin function and the feedback optimal investment–reinsurance control are found explicitly as well.}

abstract = {We analyze the probability of ruin for the scaled classical Cramér–Lundberg (CL) risk process and the corresponding diffusion approximation. The scaling, introduced by Iglehart (1969) to the actuarial literature, amounts to multiplying the Poisson rate λ by n, dividing the claim severity by n, and adjusting the premium rate so that net premium income remains constant. We are the first to use a comparison method to prove convergence of the probability of ruin for the scaled CL process and to derive the rate of convergence. Specifically, we prove a comparison lemma for the corresponding integro-differential equation and use this comparison lemma to prove that the probability of ruin for the scaled CL process converges to the probability of ruin for the limiting diffusion process. Moreover, we show that the rate of convergence for the ruin probability is of order O(n−1∕2), and we show that the convergence is uniform with respect to the surplus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rate of convergence achieved for these ruin probabilities, and we show that it is the tightest one in the general case. For the case of exponentially-distributed claims, we are able to improve the approximation arising from the diffusion, attaining a uniform O(n−k∕2) rate of convergence for arbitrary k∈N. We also include two examples that illustrate our results.}

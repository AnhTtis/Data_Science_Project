All of the baryon and lepton number conserving operators present in the SMEFT dimension six Lagrangian, defined in the Warsaw basis, are included. A flavour symmetric U(3) 5 version with possible non-SM CP violating phases, a (linear) minimal flavour violating version neglecting such phases, and the fully general flavour case are each implemented. The SMEFTsim package allows global constraints to be determined on the full Wilson coefficient space of the SMEFT. As the number of parameters present is large, it is important to develop global analyses on reduced sets of parameters minimizing any UV assumptions and relying on IR kinematics of scattering events and symmetries. We simultaneously develop the theoretical framework of a "W-Higgs-Z pole parameter" physics program that can be pursued at the LHC using this approach and the SMEFTsim package. We illustrate this methodology with several numerical examples interfacing SMEFTsim with MadGraph5. The SMEFTsim package can be downloaded at https://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/SMEFT.}},

We discuss all steps necessary to obtain a consistent transition to the spontaneously broken theory and several other important aspects, including the BRST-invariance of the SMEFT action for linear R $\xi$-gauges. The final theory is expressed in a basis characterized by SM-like propagators for all physical and unphysical fields. The effect of the non-renormalizable operators appears explicitly in triple or higher multiplicity vertices. In this mass basis we derive the complete set of Feynman rules, without resorting to any simplifying assumptions such as baryon-, lepton-number or CP conservation. As it turns out, for most SMEFT vertices the expressions are reasonably short, with a noticeable exception of those involving 4, 5 and 6 gluons. We have also supplemented our set of Feynman rules, given in an appendix here, with a publicly available Mathematica code working with the FeynRules package and producing output which can be integrated with other symbolic algebra or numerical codes for automatic SMEFT amplitude calculations.},

Our analysis includes the full set of dimension-6 and dimension-8 operators contributing to the dilepton process, and is performed to next-to-leading-order in the QCD coupling constant at both $\mathcal O(1/\Lambda^2)$ and $\mathcal O(1/\Lambda^4)$. We find that the inclusion of dimension-6 squared terms and certain dimension-8 operators has significant effects on fits to the current data. Neglecting them leads to bounds on dimension-6 operators off by large factors. We find that dimension-8 four-fermion operators can already be probed to the several-TeV level by LHC results, and that their inclusion significantly changes the limits found for dimension-6 operators. We discuss which dimension-8 operators should be included in fits to the LHC data. Only a manageable subset of two-derivative dimension-8 four-fermion operators need to be included at this stage given current LHC uncertainties.},

  abstract      = {HighPT is a Mathematica package for the analysis of high-energy data of semileptonic transitions at hadron colliders. It allows to compute high-$p_T$ tail observables for semileptonic processes, i.e. Drell-Yan cross sections, for dilepton and monolepton final states at the LHC. These observables can be calculated at tree level within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, including the relevant operators up to dimension eight to ensure a consistent description of the cross section including terms of $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda^{-4})$ in the cutoff scale $\Lambda$. For New Physics models with new mediators that can be resolved at LHC energies, HighPT can also account for the full propagation effects of these new bosonic states at tree level. Using the available data from the high-$p_T$ tails in the relevant LHC run-II searches by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, HighPT can also construct the corresponding likelihoods for all possible flavors of the leptonic final states. As an illustration, we derive and compare constraints on Wilson coefficients at different orders in the Effective Field Theory expansion, and we investigate lepton flavor violation for the $S_3$ leptoquark model. The HighPT code is publicly available at https://github.com/HighPT/HighPT.},

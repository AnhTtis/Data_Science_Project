    "abstract": "Given a metric $γ$ of nonnegative Gauss curvature and a positive function $H$ on a $2$-sphere $Σ$, we estimate the Bartnik quasi-local mass of $(Σ, γ, H)$ in terms of the area, the total mean curvature, and a quantity depending only on $γ$, measuring the roundness of the metric. If $γ$ has positive Gauss curvature, the roundness of $γ$ in the estimate is controlled by the ratio $κ$ between the maximum and the minimum of the Gauss curvature. As $κ\\to 1$, the estimate approaches a sharp estimate for round spheres with arbitrary, positive mean curvature functions.\n  Enroute we observe an estimate of the supremum of the total mean curvature among nonnegative scalar curvature fill-ins of a closed manifold with positive scalar curvature.",

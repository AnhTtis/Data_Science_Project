    "abstract": "We consider a real scalar field equation in dimension 1+1 with an even positive self-interaction potential having two non-degenerate zeros (vacua) 1 and -1. It is known that such a model admits non-trivial static solutions called kinks and antikinks. A kink cluster is a solution approaching, for large positive times, a superposition of alternating kinks and antikinks whose velocities converge to 0. They can be equivalently characterised as the solutions of minimal possible energy containing a given number of transitions between the vacua, or as the solutions whose kinetic energy decays to 0 for large time. Our main result is a determination of the main-order asymptotic behaviour of any kink cluster. Moreover, we construct a kink cluster for any prescribed initial positions of the kinks and antikinks, provided that their mutual distances are sufficiently large. Finally, we show that kink clusters are universal profiles for the formation/collapse of multi-kink configurations. The proofs rely on a reduction, using appropriately chosen modulation parameters, to an n-body problem with attractive exponential interactions.",

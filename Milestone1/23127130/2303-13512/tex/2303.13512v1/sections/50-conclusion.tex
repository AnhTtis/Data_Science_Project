We ran the MineRL BASALT Competition on Fine-Tuning from Human Feedback at NeurIPS 2022 to promote research on fine-tuning techniques that enable agents to accomplish tasks without crisply-defined reward functions. 
We described the competition, summarized the top solutions, and investigated the performance of the competitors. 
We believe that this competition achieved its main research goals of encouraging the development of algorithms to solve hard-to-specify tasks. 
However, we identified and provided concrete avenues for improvement in the future.

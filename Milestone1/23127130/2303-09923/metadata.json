    "abstract": "Exciton-polaritons resulting from the strong exciton-photon interaction stimulate the development of novel coherent light sources with low threshold, long range spatial, and temporal coherence to circumvent the ever increasing energy demands of optical communications. Polaritons from bound states in the continuum (BICs) are promising for Bose-Einstein condensation owing to their infinite quality factors that enlarge photon lifetimes and benefit polariton accumulations. However, BIC polariton condensation remains limited to cryogenic temperatures ascribed to the small exciton binding energies of conventional material platforms. Herein, we demonstrated a room-temperature BIC polaritonic platform based on halide perovskite air-hole photonic crystals, profiting from the non-radiative BIC states and stable excitons of cesium lead bromide. BIC polariton condensation was achieved near the dispersion minimum that generates directional vortex beam emission with long-range coherence. Our work provides a significant basis for the applications of polariton condensates for integrated photonic and topological circuits.",

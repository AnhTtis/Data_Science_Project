\section{Ethical Considerations}
In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset derived from publicly available YouTube videos.
With an emphasis on teaching machines about real-world conversation, our dataset includes frames that present the interlocutors.
It might capture their facial expressions and body cues, however, may give rise to user privacy concerns.
To mitigate this issue, we release only the video IDs instead of raw videos, following the prior works~\cite{zellers2021merlot, zellers2022merlot}.
It allows users to delete their video from YouTube, thereby excluding them from the dataset.
To strengthen user privacy even further, future directions may include works such as anonymizing faces and speech from the videos, and deidentifying personal information from the transcripts.

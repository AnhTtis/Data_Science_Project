\section{Conclusion}
We introduce \datasetName, a large-scale video-based dialogue dataset and \modelName, a model that learns about the real-world conversation from \datasetNameNoEmoji.
Our experiments show that \modelNameNoEmoji exhibits strong performance in various real-world conversation tasks, indicating that video-based dialogues can help models to learn about real-world conversations. 
We will release our data and model checkpoints for research purposes. 
In future work, we plan to explore the potential of utilizing auditory signals from videos to further enhance our understanding of real-world conversations.

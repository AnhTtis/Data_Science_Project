Sample dialogues from two different datasets: (a) \datasetNameNoEmoji, and (b) the example from MMDialog presented in their paper~\cite{feng2022mmdialog}.
According to the human evaluation results, our \datasetNameNoEmoji dataset has a good balance of both social interactions (left; 62\%) and visually-grounded dialogue (right; 38\%), in contrast, MMDialog only has 12\% social interactions.
In addition, MMDialog is derived from social media, resulting in examples that contain emojis or other social media-specific elements, while \datasetNameNoEmoji is derived from videos and thus genuinely capture real-life communications.

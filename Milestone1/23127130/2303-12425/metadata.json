    "abstract": "Mean-field dynamo theory has important applications in solar physics and galactic magnetism. We discuss some of the many turbulence effects relevant to the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the solar convection zone. The mean-field description is then used to illustrate the physics of the $α$ effect, turbulent pumping, turbulent magnetic diffusivity, and other effects on a modern solar dynamo model. We also discuss how turbulence transport coefficients are derived from local simulations of convection and then used in mean-field models.",

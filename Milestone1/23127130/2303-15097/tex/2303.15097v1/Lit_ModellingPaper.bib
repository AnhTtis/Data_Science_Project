  abstract = {Forecasting heat demand is necessary for production and operation planning of district heating (DH) systems. In this study we first propose a simple regression model where the hourly outdoor temperature and wind speed forecast the heat demand. Weekly rhythm of heat consumption as a social component is added to the model to significantly improve the accuracy. The other type of model is the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model with exogenous variables as a combination to take weather factors, and the historical heat consumption data as depending variables. One outstanding advantage of the model is that it peruses the high accuracy for both long-term and short-term forecast by considering both exogenous factors and time series. The forecasting performance of both linear regression models and time series model are evaluated based on real-life heat demand data for the city of Espoo in Finland by out-of-sample tests for the last 20 full weeks of the year. The results indicate that the proposed linear regression model (T168h) using 168-h demand pattern with midweek holidays classified as Saturdays or Sundays gives the highest accuracy and strong robustness among all the tested models based on the tested forecasting horizon and corresponding data. Considering the parsimony of the input, the ease of use and the high accuracy, the proposed T168h model is the best in practice. The heat demand forecasting model can also be developed for individual buildings if automated meter reading customer measurements are available. This would allow forecasting the heat demand based on more accurate heat consumption data directly from the customers and almost in real time. Also, the model can be used for production planning of combined heat and power (CHP) system to improve the energy efficiency.},

Compared to small solar domestic hot water (DHW) systems for single-family houses, the solar heat cost can be cut at least in third. The most interesting projects for replacing fossil fuels and the reduction of CO2-emissions are solar systems with seasonal storage in combination with gas or biomass boilers. In the framework of the EU–APAS project “Large-scale Solar Heating Systems”, thirteen existing plants in six European countries have been evaluated. The yearly solar gains of the systems are between 300 and 550 kWh per m2 collector area. The investment cost of solar plants with short-term storage varies from 300 up to 600 ECU per m2. Systems with seasonal storage show investment costs twice as high. Results of studies concerning the market potential for solar heating plants, taking new collector concepts and industrial production into account, are presented. Site specific studies and predesign of large-scale solar heating plants in six European countries for housing developments show a 50% cost reduction compared to existing projects. The cost–benefit-ratio for the planned systems with long-term storage is between 0.7 and 1.5 ECU per kWh per year.},

The demand in each intraday period is modeled using semiparametric regression smoothing to account for calendar and weather components. Residual serial dependence is captured by one of two multivariate stationary time series models, with a dimension equal to the number of intraday periods. These are a periodic autoregression and a dynamic factor model. We show the benefits of our approach in the forecasting of (a) district heating demand in a steam network in Germany and (b) aggregate electricity demand in the state of Victoria, Australia. In both studies, accounting for weather can improve the forecast quality substantially, as does the use of time series models. We compare the effectiveness of the periodic autoregression with three variations of the dynamic factor model, and find that the dynamic factor model consistently provides more accurate forecasts. Overall, our approach combines many of the features which have previously been shown to provide high quality forecasts of energy demand over horizons of up to one week, as well as introducing some novel ones.},

Specifically, this paper shows how to budget various components of agreement and disagreement between maps. The components are based on the separation of a map's information of quantity from its information of location. The technique also examines how variation in resolution influences the measurement of the components of information. The manner in which the measurements change as a function of spatial resolution can be more important and interesting than the results at any single particular resolution, because the results at a single particular resolution may indicate more about the format of the data than about the overall pattern in the landscape. An example illustrates the mathematical concepts, and an application compares mapped vegetation indices in Africa to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach vis-{\`a}-vis a conventional approach. The results are presented visually in the form of stacked bar graphs that show separable components of information. The entire analysis is performed twice, each time with a different mathematical measurement of deviation: (1) root mean square error, and (2) mean absolute error. This paper compares these two approaches and discusses their relative advantages and disadvantages. Hopefully, this approach of budgeting components of information at multiple resolutions will become adopted as standard practice in the measurement of patterns.},

  abstract = {Variability of solar resource poses difficulties in grid management as solar penetration rates rise continuously. Thus, the task of solar power forecasting becomes crucial to ensure grid stability and to enable an optimal unit commitment and economical dispatch. Several forecast horizons can be identified, spanning from a few seconds to days or weeks ahead, as well as spatial horizons, from single site to regional forecasts. New techniques and approaches arise worldwide each year to improve accuracy of models with the ultimate goal of reducing uncertainty in the predictions. This paper appears with the aim of compiling a large part of the knowledge about solar power forecasting, focusing on the latest advancements and future trends. Firstly, the motivation to achieve an accurate forecast is presented with the analysis of the economic implications it may have. It is followed by a summary of the main techniques used to issue the predictions. Then, the benefits of point/regional forecasts and deterministic/probabilistic forecasts are discussed. It has been observed that most recent papers highlight the importance of probabilistic predictions and they incorporate an economic assessment of the impact of the accuracy of the forecasts on the grid. Later on, a classification of authors according to forecast horizons and origin of inputs is presented, which represents the most up-to-date compilation of solar power forecasting studies. Finally, all the different metrics used by the researchers have been collected and some remarks for enabling a fair comparison among studies have been stated.},

  abstract = {Solar photovoltaic plants are widely integrated into most countries worldwide. Due to the ever-growing utilization of solar photovoltaic plants, either via grid-connection or stand-alone networks, dramatic changes can be anticipated in both power system planning and operating stages. Solar photovoltaic integration requires the capability of handling the uncertainty and fluctuations of power output. In this case, solar photovoltaic power forecasting is a crucial aspect to ensure optimum planning and modelling of the solar photovoltaic plants. Accurate forecasting provides the grid operators and power system designers with significant information to design an optimal solar photovoltaic plant as well as managing the power of demand and supply. This paper presents an extensive review on recent advancements in the field of solar photovoltaic power forecasting. This paper aims to analyze and compare various methods of solar photovoltaic power forecasting in terms of characteristics and performance. This work classifies solar photovoltaic power forecasting methods into three major categories i.e., time-series statistical methods, physical methods, and ensemble methods. To date, Artificial Intelligence approaches are widely used due to their capability in solving the non-linear and complex structure of data. The performance analysis shows that these methods outperform the traditional methods. Recently, the ensemble methods were also developed by researchers to extract the unique features of single models to enhance the forecast model performances. This combination produces accurate results compared to individual models. This paper also elaborates on the metrics assessment which was implemented to evaluate the forecast model performances. This work provides information which is beneficial for researchers and engineers who are involved in the modelling and planning of the solar photovoltaic plant.},

  abstract = {tAccurate forecasting simultaneously becomes more important and more challenging due to the increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in the built environment on the one hand, and the increasing stochastic nature of electricity consumption, e.g., through electric vehicles (EVs), on the other hand. Until recently, research has mainly focused on deterministic forecasting. However, such forecasts convey little information about the possible future state of a system and since a forecast is inherently erroneous, it is important to quantify this error. This paper therefore focuses on the recent advances in the area of probabilistic forecasting of solar power (PSPF) and load forecasting (PLF). The goal of a probabilistic forecast is to provide either a complete predictive density of the future state or to predict that the future state of a system will fall in an interval, defined by a confidence level. The aim of this paper is to analyze the state of the art and assess the different approaches in terms of their performance, but also to what extent these approaches can be generalized so that they not only perform best on the data set for which they were designed, but also on other data sets or different case studies. In addition, growing interest in net demand forecasting, i.e., demand less generation, is another important motivation to combine PSPF and PLF into one review paper and assess compatibility. One important finding is that there is no single preferred model that can be applied to any circumstance. In fact, a study has shown that the same model, with adapted parameters, applied to different case studies performed well but did not excel, when compared to models that were optimized for the specific task. Furthermore, there is need for standardization, in particular in terms of filtering night time data, normalizing results and performance metrics.},

  abstract = {To mitigate the impact of climate change and global warming, the use of renewable energies is increasing day by day significantly. A considerable amount of electricity is generated from renewable energy sources since the last decade. Among the potential renewable energies, photovoltaic (PV) has experienced enormous growth in electricity generation. A large number of PV systems have been installed in on-grid and off-grid systems in the last few years. The number of PV systems will increase rapidly in the future due to the policies of the government and international organizations, and the advantages of PV technology. However, the variability of PV power generation creates different negative impacts on the electric grid system, such as the stability, reliability, and planning of the operation, aside from the economic benefits. Therefore, accurate forecasting of PV power generation is significantly important to stabilize and secure grid operation and promote large-scale PV power integration. A good number of research has been conducted to forecast PV power generation in different perspectives. This paper made a comprehensive and systematic review of the direct forecasting of PV power generation. The importance of the correlation of the input-output data and the preprocessing of model input data are discussed. This review covers the performance analysis of several PV power forecasting models based on different classifications. The critical analysis of recent works, including statistical and machine-learning models based on historical data, is also presented.

  abstract = {We forecast high-resolution solar irradiance time series using an exponential smoothing state space (ESSS) model. To stationarize the irradiance data before applying linear time series models, we propose a novel Fourier trend model and compare the performance with other popular trend models using residual analysis and the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) stationarity test. Using the optimized Fourier trend, an ESSS model is implemented to forecast the stationary residual series of datasets from Singapore and Colorado, USA. To compare the performance with other time series models, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), linear exponential smoothing (LES), simple exponential smoothing (SES) and random walk (RW) models are tested using the same data. The simulation results show that the ESSS model has generally better performance than other time series forecasting models. To assess the reliability of the forecasting model in real-time applications, a complementary study of the forecasting 95% confidence interval and forecasting horizon of the ESSS model has been conducted.},

The accuracies of the A-P models are highly region dependent coefficients. Therefore, these coefficients are determined empirically. In this study, five novel semi-empiric models for hourly solar radiation forecasting are developed. These models utilize historical data of the solar irradiance, the extraterrestrial irradiance and the clearness index while forecasting. To test the effectiveness of the proposed models, three different regions are deliberately selected, and solar data are measured and collected hourly. To show the effectiveness of the proposed models, the forecasting results are compared with the A-P type equation based models. The proposed approach is concluded to be superior compared with the previously developed A-P type equation based models.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a new approach to online forecasting of power output from solar thermal collectors. The method is suited for online forecasting in many applications and in this paper it is applied to predict hourly values of power from a standard single glazed large area flat plate collector. The method is applied for horizons of up to 42 hours. Solar heating systems naturally come with a hot water tank, which can be utilized for energy storage also for other energy sources. Thereby such systems can become an important part of energy systems with a large share of uncontrollable energy sources, such as wind power. In such a scenario online forecasting is a vital tool for optimal control and utilization of solar heating systems. The method is a two-step scheme, where first a non-linear model is applied to transform the solar power into a stationary process, which then is forecasted with robust time-adaptive linear models. The approach is similar to the one by Bacher et al. (2009), but contains additional effects due to differences between solar thermal collectors and photovoltaics. Numerical weather predictions provided by Danish Meteorological Institute are used as input. The applied models adapt over time enabling tracking of changes in the system and in the surrounding conditions, such as decreasing performance due to wear and dirt, and seasonal changes such as leaves on trees. This furthermore facilitates remote monitoring and check of the system.},

This paper presents a solution that couples a meteorological model with a solar power plant performance model. The power output is predicted 24 h ahead in the case of a solar Fresnel power plant. The required Direct Normal Irradiance is inferred from the global horizontal irradiance; the thermal production is evaluated from an optical and thermal model.

  abstract = {This study compares the performance of estimation methods for site-specific solar collector yield using two simplified collector efficiency equations-based models for training and testing of the model. Two different collector efficiency equations are used for comparative evaluation: One employs a first order collector efficiency equation defined in terms of collector inlet temperature, solar irradiance, and outdoor temperature, termed first-order equation model with constant Tci. The other equation model is a modified collector efficiency equation expressed with the terms of heating load, solar irradiance, and outdoor temperature, termed modified equation model with heat load input. In the approach with the first-order equation model, the collector inlet temperature term is treated as another parameter to be estimated as an effective collector inlet temperature. To evaluate the equation-based models, the Polysun simulation program is used for generating a data set of solar water heating system. For evaluation of daily solar collector yield estimation, two data sets were generated: training data set and testing data set. For evaluation of hourly solar collector yield estimation, training and testing performances were evaluated respectively. By using hourly simulated data, the hourly collector estimation performance was evaluated in terms of daily root-mean-squared error for the process of model training to compare the performance of fitness of the model for hourly estimation. The daily performance of two models showed quite similar estimation results. The comparison of the hourly performance of the two models resulted in a better performance of the modified equation model with heat load input.},

Six ANN models have been developed for the prediction of the standard performance collector equation coefficients, both at wind and no-wind conditions, the incidence angle modifier coefficients at longitudinal and transverse directions, the collector time constant, the collector stagnation temperature and the collector heat capacity. Different networks were used due to the different nature of the input and output required in each case. The data used for the training, testing and validation of the networks were obtained from the LTS database. The results obtained when unknown data were presented to the networks are very satisfactory and indicate that the proposed method can successfully be used for the prediction of the performance parameters of flat-plate solar collectors. The advantages of this approach compared to the conventional testing methods are speed, simplicity, and the capacity of the network to learn from examples. This is done by embedding experiential knowledge in the network.},

The data used is 15-min observations of solar power from 21 PV systems located on rooftops in a small village in Denmark. The suggested method is a two-stage method where first a statistical normalization of the solar power is obtained using a clear sky model. The clear sky model is found using statistical smoothing techniques. Then forecasts of the normalized solar power are calculated using adaptive linear time series models. Both autoregressive (AR) and AR with exogenous input (ARX) models are evaluated, where the latter takes numerical weather predictions (NWPs) as input. The results indicate that for forecasts up to 2h ahead the most important input is the available observations of solar power, while for longer horizons NWPs are the most important input. A root mean square error improvement of around 35% is achieved by the ARX model compared to a proposed reference model.},

The comparison of the forecasting performances of Multiple regression and Exponential smoothing methods has been analysed.

  abstract = {Electric Energy Storage Systems (EESS) have received an increased attention in recent years due to their important role in an active management of energy supply systems. Fueled by the increasing shares of intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in today's energy supply, balancing energy demand and energy supply over time becomes more and more challenging. EESS are recognized as a key technology to overcome this challenge by storing energy and converting it back when needed. Even though some EESS solutions are already available on the market, EESS suffer from technical limitations and entail high investment costs. Energy management is responsible for managing the operations of EESS and the interactions with the surrounding systems. An optimal energy management is an important precondition to ensure economic viability of EESS. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on energy management for stationary EESS applications. The aim of the paper is to give a comprehensive overview of the literature in this field and to develop a conceptual framework that facilitates the structuring of research on the management of EESS and the identification of future research opportunities. The paper first introduces the methodology used for the literature review and then descriptively analyzes the identified publications. Afterwards, it outlines the proposed conceptual framework that provides a structure for categorizing the identified literature. Subsequently, we discuss the identified papers in light of the proposed framework. The paper then concludes with a discussion of future research opportunities.},

The integration of such distributed energy sources into utility grid paves the way for microgrids. The microgrid concept is introduced to have a self-sustained system consisting of distributed energy resources that can operate in an islanded mode during grid failures. In microgrid, an energy management system is essential for optimal use of these distributed energy resources in intelligent, secure, reliable, and coordinated ways. Therefore, this review paper presents a comparative and critical analysis on decision making strategies and their solution methods for microgrid energy management systems. To manage the volatility and intermittency of renewable energy resources and load demand, various uncertainty quantification methods are summarized. A comparative analysis on communication technologies is also discussed for cost-effective implementation of microgrid energy management systems. Finally, insights into future directions and real world applications are provided.},

Such multi-energy systems (MES) can be operated more efficiently with the aid of optimization-based energy management systems (EMS). However, most existing EMS are tailor-made for one specific system or class of systems, i.e.are not generally applicable. Furthermore, only limited information on the actual savings potential of the usage of an EMS under realistic conditions is available. Therefore, this paper presents a novel modular modeling approach for an EMS for urban MES, which also enables the modeling of complex system configurations. To assess the actual savings potential of the proposed EMS, a comprehensive case study was carried out. In the course of this the influence of different user behavior, changing climatic conditions and forecast errors on the savings potential was analyzed by comparing it with a conventional control strategy. The results showed that using the proposed EMS in conjunction with supplementary system components (thermal energy storage and battery) an annual cost savings potential of between 3 and 6% could be achieved.},

The effects of the temperature and the mass flow rate of the heat transfer medium, the heat transfer area of the system components, and the solution circulation rate on the system performance are investigated in detail. The results obtained indicate that a higher heating capacity is obtained with an increase in driving steam temperature, waste heat temperature, and mass flow rate of hot water and waste water. It is also found that the heating capacity becomes higher with an increase in heat transfer area of the system components except solution heat exchanger. An increase in solution flow rate leads to higher heating capacity but to lower COP. A practical absorption heat pump, installed at a chemical plant, was also simulated numerically. The simulation results were compared with the operation data of the practical system.},

Holman correlation is applied to the calculation of heat transfer coefficients of the evaporator, condenser, solution heat exchanger, and generator. The heat and mass transfer in the absorber, chiefly controlled by the mass transfer resistance on the liquid side, are described according to a lumped but accurate physical model based on Nusselt’s film theory. The dynamic performance of the absorption chiller is evaluated under the disturbance of the cooling water inlet temperature and heat source temperature. The effect of the thermal mass of the main components on the dynamic performance is explored. Two control strategies are implemented in the model of the absorption chiller: one is setting the chilled water outlet temperature as the manipulated variable, and the other is setting the generator solution temperature as the manipulated variable. The control performances of the two strategies are compared in detail. Results show that either increasing the heat source temperature or decreasing the cooling water inlet temperature increases the risk of crystallization in the dynamic process. The time to reach steady state is highly dependent on the thermal mass of the generator, rather than the thermal masses of the condenser, evaporator, and absorber. The single-effect chiller has better control performance in off-design condition when the generator solution temperature rather than the chilled water outlet temperature is selected as the manipulated variable.},

Key details of different aspects of research and development such as steady-state and transient thermodynamic models, control algorithm development, and implementation are presented. Advanced multivariable feedback controls are able to perform better than individual feedback control loops and conventional on/off controls. The knowledge of the transient response of heat pump systems through models or experimental data is crucial for advanced control system design and implementation. Recently, data-based methods have also gained interest, but they are difficult to generalize. A general outlook with limitations and the potential of different approaches, and recommendations for future work are provided.},

Absorption chillers' behaviour could be very complex and unpredictable, especially when the boundary conditions are variable. The system dynamic must therefore be included in the model. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proved to be suitable for handling such complex problems, particularly when the physical phenomena inside the system are difficult to model. Reliable “black box” ANN modelling is able to identify the system's global model without any advanced knowledge of its internal operating principles. Knowledge of the system's global inputs and outputs is sufficient. The methodology proposed was applied to evaluate a commercial absorption chiller. Predictions of the ANN model developed were compared, with a satisfactory degree of precision, to 2 days of experimental measures. These days were chosen to be representative of the real dynamic operating conditions of an absorption chiller. The neural model predictions are very satisfactory: absolute relative errors of the transferred energy are within 0.1–6.6%.},

The main difficulties are related to the presence of safety constraints and the nonlinearity as well as the hybrid nature of the system. The resulting optimization problem is simplified using various relaxations. The second controller is dedicated to the control of the building temperature. Using a model of the building thermal behavior, it sends its predicted operating profile to the SHWS controller. The performances of these two interacting controllers are illustrated by various simulations on a TRNSYS model of the building and its subsystems.},

A detailed model of the plant is first obtained as a mix of first principle equations, validated with data collected on the plant, and identification techniques. Then, the model is simplified and used to formulate a hybrid Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem computing the optimal plant configuration over a prediction horizon of six hours, or more, and based on the available forecast of the solar radiation and user demand. The developed MPC algorithm has been used to control the plant; some of the collected results are reported here to witness the potentialities of the proposed approach.},

Solar thermal systems usually operate with both feedback and feedforward controllers. The focus of many existing studies in solar thermal system applications has been on the feedback part, while less effort has been made to improve the performance of the feedforward part. This paper introduces a novel robust feedforward controller as a sub-controller of an optimal controller for operating a heat pump integrated with the solar thermal system. In a simulation environment, the optimal control structure is implemented, and the performance of the robust feedforward controller is compared with a simple feedforward controller. Regarding the electrical power consumption, the simulation results demonstrate that the optimal control structure with the proposed robust feedforward controller outperforms the control structure with the simple feedforward controller.},

Heat and mass transfer in the evaporator–absorber and in the desorber are described according to a physical model for vapour absorption based on Nusselt’s film theory. The other heat exchangers are handled using a simplified approach based on the NTU-effectiveness method. The model is then used to analyze the chiller response to a step drop of the heat recovery circuit flow rate, and to a sudden reduction of the cooling need in the conditioned space.

  abstract = {Although absorption cooling has been available for many years, the technology has typically been viewed as a poorly performing alternative to vapour compression refrigeration. However, rising energy prices and the requirement to improve energy-efficiency is driving renewed interest in the technology, particularly within the context of combined cooling, heat and power systems (CCHP) for buildings. In order to understand the performance of absorption cooling, numerous models are available in the literature. The complexities involved in the thermodynamics of absorption chillers have, however, so far restricted researchers to creating steady-state or dynamic models reliant on data measurements of the internal chiller state, which require difficult-to-obtain, intrusive measurements. The pragmatic, yet fully dynamic model described in this paper is designed to be easily calibrated using data obtained from the measurements of inflows and outflows to a chiller, without resorting to intrusive measurements. The model comprises a series of linked control volumes featuring both performance maps and lumped mass volumes, which reflect the underlying physical structure of the device. The paper describes the modelling approach, theory and limitations, along with an example of the implementation of the model in the ESP-r code complete with calibration and an application to a specific example.},

It has been designed according to the experience with an experimental DEAHP totally integrated into a solar-assisted multi-effect distillation (MED) plant set up at CIEMAT – Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA). The non-linear first-principles model was implemented using the equation-based object-oriented Modelica modeling language and is based on a mathematical formulation that describes the main heat and mass transfer phenomena in this kind of facilities. A modular and hierarchical modeling methodology has allowed a graphical modeling development. Submodels that wrap the different physical phenomena are interconnected between them, thus making a three level deep hierarchy. All the submodels have been calibrated and validated with experimental data. The numerical predictions show a good agreement with measured data.},

In this paper, a model library of absorption systems with different working mediums and cycle configurations is presented. Library flexibility and extensibility is achieved through the adoption of object-oriented modeling techniques, allowing considerable reduction of the development time through model reuse.

The continuity of species constituting the LiBr–H2O solution, momentum equations and energy balances are solved simultaneously. Six various cases are considered to evaluate the effect of thermal masses of all and some components on the key parameters of an absorption chiller. To eliminate the numerical errors, thermodynamic properties are taken from the EES software. Since the performance of the cycle should be evaluated in each time step, a link is made between EES and MATLAB softwares. The fourth order Runge–Kutta method is selected to solve the simultaneous differential equations. The results show that the heat transfer rate of high-pressure components (generator and condenser) are highly dependent of thermal mass of the condenser whereas the heat transfer rate of low-pressure components (evaporator and absorber) are hardly affected by thermal masses. Furthermore, the major components except condenser show approximately the same behavior when thermal masses are ignored.},

Therefore, mathematically simple models of thesystem to be controlled are required. This contribution proposes a new approach for such a model for a H2O-LiBrAHPS. The model results from the linearization of a more complex, nonlinear simulation model, leading to asimple, but physically still meaningful linear state-space model structure. The experimental validation shows thatthe developed model describes the system{\textquoteright}s dynamics and cross-coupling effects sufficiently well and indicates thatit is suitable to serve as a basis for the development of a model-based control strategy for AHPS.},

An improved method of the characteristic equations for single-effect      H 2  O / LiBr     absorption chillers is used in combination with a simple dry-cooler model to describe the part load behavior of both components. The aim of the control strategy is to find a cut-in and a cut-off condition for the solar heat operation (SHO) of an absorption chiller cooling assembly (i.e., including all the supply pumps and the dry cooler) under the constraint that the specific electricity demand during SHO is lower than the electricity demand of a reference cooling technology (e.g., a compression chiller cooling assembly). Especially for the cut-in condition, the model predictive control algorithm calculates a minimum driving temperature, which has to be reached by the solar collector and storage in order to cover the cooling load with a low cooling water temperature but restricted auxiliary electricity demand. Measurements at a solar cooling system for an IT center were used for the testing and a first evaluation of the control algorithm.},

Components of groups a-c are modelled based on discretized volumes in which the unsteady mass, species and energy conservation equations are imposed, whereas solution pump and restrictors are idealized as algebraic models. The experimental analysis covers a period of over 10 h, during which various step changes are applied to system inputs like gas power, inlet water temperature, solution and refrigerant flow rates, and brine inlet temperature. The results of the numerical model are compared with the experimental data which show good agreement in both transient and near steady state operation. Results show that, during transient operation average deviations are less than 2.94% and near steady-state conditions are less than 1.70%. The accuracy of the numerical model in predicting both the transient response and the steady-state values of the measurable outputs, makes it a valuable tool to gain insight on the internal dynamics of ammonia-water absorption heat pumps and cut down costs on time-consuming optimization experiments, such as the fine-tuning of initial solution charge, the implementation of a suitable concentration control strategy and the performance optimization at full and partial loads.},

  abstract = {This work describes transient numerical modeling of a direct air-cooled, single-effect absorption chiller. The model is lumped parametric based on transient mass, momentum, and energy balances, applied to the internal components of the absorption machine. Thermal and mass storage in each one of the components are taken into account in the transient evaluation, and pressure losses in the SHX are evaluated using a pressure drop coefficient. This work aims to improve the available numerical modeling propositions by using embedded available heat and mass transfer empirical correlations, based on previous experiences in falling film absorption. This approach minimizes the need for experimental parameter identification and allows scalability studies. The experimental validation has been organized in three steps: (i) absorber zero-order model, steady-state conditions; (ii) the whole chiller, also in steady-state conditions; (iii) transient conditions. For the steady-state conditions, most results have an agreement within the margin of the uncertainty of the experiments, with a medium discrepancy of 5% in COP and 11% in the cooling capacity. For transient conditions, the comparison of the outlet temperatures of the secondary streams, reveals discrepancies under 0.5 K, except in some fast transient periods, where higher differences are perceived. To perform the numerical simulations is used as an in-house modular object-oriented simulation platform (NEST platform). Finally, the performance of a prototype demonstration 7 kW air-cooled LiBr-H2O absorption chiller is predicted through a designed test campaign. This model put gives valuable information for the definition of further regulation and control protocols.},

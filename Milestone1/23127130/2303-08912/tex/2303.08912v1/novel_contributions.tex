\section{Outline and Novel Contributions}

To the knowledge of the authors, this work presents the first convex formulation
for the modeling of bodies undergoing large deformations coupled with
articulated rigid bodies through frictional contact and holonomic constraints.

We make a number of contributions. We introduce a novel linear corotational
model of large deformations with a positive semi-definite Hessian in
Section~\ref{sec:corotational_model}. Section~\ref{sec:convex_formulation} uses
this model to extend our previous work on the convex formulation of compliant
contact \cite{bib:castro2022unconstrained} to model deformable bodies.
Sections~\ref{sec:constraint_resolution} and \ref{sec:schur_complement} show how
to exploit sparsity and reuse intermediate computations in our Cholesky
factorizations to write a much smaller contact problem. We present validation
and simulation results relevant to robotics in Section \ref{sec:results} along
with performance metrics. Finally, as part of the open-source robotics toolkit
Drake \cite{bib:drake}, we implement our method with
exhaustive testing and thorough documentation.

\section{Introduction}

Robotics is on the cusp of a new era. Cutting-edge advancements in machine
learning, computational power, and manufacturing techniques are pushing the limits
of hardware design, sensing, modeling, and control.

The development of soft robotic systems \cite{bib:schmitt2018soft}, deformable
object manipulation capabilities \cite{bib:zhu2022challenges}, and vision-based
tactile sensors \cite{bib:kuppuswamy2020soft, bib:agarwal2021simulation} has
opened up new possibilities for robotics applications in controlled industrial
environments and unstructured home environments. However, these new systems
present challenges in modeling and simulation, particularly when the traditional
rigid-body assumptions of robotic simulators are no longer valid
\cite{bib:zhu2022challenges, bib:lin2021softgym}. One major challenge is the
need for unified simulators that can handle both rigid and deformable objects
that interact through frictional contact \cite{bib:zhu2022challenges}. Despite
these challenges, there is still much potential for growth and innovation in the
field of robotics, and the development of open-source simulation capabilities
targeting robotic applications could play a crucial role in advancing the field.

    deformable ball (see supplemental video). Contours colored by strain
    visualize the state of deformations of the ball. Our method resolves the
    frictional contact between the rigid hand and the deformable ball, enabling
    a secure grasp at interactive rates.}

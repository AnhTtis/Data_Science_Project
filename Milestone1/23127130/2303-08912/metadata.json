    "abstract": "We present a novel convex formulation that models rigid and deformable bodies coupled through frictional contact. The formulation incorporates a new corotational material model with positive semi-definite Hessian, which allows us to extend our previous work on the convex formulation of compliant contact to model large body deformations. We rigorously characterize our approximations and present implementation details. With proven global convergence, effective warm-start, the ability to take large time steps, and specialized sparse algebra, our method runs robustly at interactive rates. We provide validation results and performance metrics on challenging simulations relevant to robotics applications. Our method is made available in the open-source robotics toolkit Drake.",

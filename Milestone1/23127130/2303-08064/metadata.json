    "abstract": "The variance reduction speed of physically-based rendering is heavily affected by the adopted importance sampling technique. In this paper we propose a novel online framework to learn the spatial-varying density model with a single small neural network using stochastic ray samples. To achieve this task, we propose a novel closed-form density model called the normalized anisotropic spherical gaussian mixture, that can express complex irradiance fields with a small number of parameters. Our framework learns the distribution in a progressive manner and does not need any warm-up phases. Due to the compact and expressive representation of our density model, our framework can be implemented entirely on the GPU, allowing it produce high quality images with limited computational resources.",

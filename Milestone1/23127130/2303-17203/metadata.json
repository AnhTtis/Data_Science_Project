    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the Kirkwood-Dirac nonclassicality and uncertainty diagram based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in a $d$ dimensional system. The uncertainty diagram of complete incompatibility bases $\\mathcal {A},\\mathcal {B}$ are characterized by De Bièvre [arXiv: 2207.07451]. We show that for the uncertainty diagram of the DFT matrix which is a transition matrix from basis $\\mathcal {A}$ to basis $\\mathcal {B}$, there is no ``hole\" in the region of the $(n_{\\mathcal {A}}, n_{\\mathcal {B}})$-plane above and on the line $n_{\\mathcal {A}}+n_{\\mathcal {B}}\\geq d+1$, whether the bases $\\mathcal {A},\\mathcal {B}$ are not complete incompatible bases or not. Then we present that the KD nonclassicality of a state based on the DFT matrix can be completely characterized by using the support uncertainty relation $n_{\\mathcal {A}}(ψ)n_{\\mathcal {B}}(ψ)\\geq d$, where $n_{\\mathcal {A}}(ψ)$ and $n_{\\mathcal {B}}(ψ)$ count the number of nonvanishing coefficients in the basis $\\mathcal {A}$ and $\\mathcal {B}$ representations, respectively. That is, a state $|ψ\\rangle$ is KD nonclassical if and only if $n_{\\mathcal {A}}(ψ)n_{\\mathcal {B}}(ψ)> d$, whenever $d$ is prime or not. That gives a positive answer to the conjecture in [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{127}, 190404 (2021)].",

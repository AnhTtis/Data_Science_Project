    "abstract": "This paper proposes an algorithm that combines Fast Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation and Model Predictive Control subject to an observability constraint designed to ensure a lower bound on the performance of the parameter estimator. Output-feedback stability is proved through input-to-state stability of the state/error system under a small noise and initial error assumption. Numerical experiments have been carried out in the case of Active Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM).",

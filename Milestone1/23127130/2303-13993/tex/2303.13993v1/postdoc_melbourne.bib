	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of localization and circumnavigation of a slowly drifting target with an unknown speed by a group of autonomous agents while they form a regular polygon at a known distance from the target. The goal is achieved in a distributed way where each of the agents coordinates its motion knowing its own position and either the bearing angle of the target or the distance to the target, and the position of one of its neighbours. First, we solve the problem for the case where the target is stationary and propose a two-stage control law that forces the agents to move on a circular trajectory around the target and form a regular polygon formation. Then, we consider the case where the target is undergoing a slow but possibly persistent movement. Later, we consider the case where only one of the agents know the desired distance from the target. In the end, the case in which only a subset of agents can measure either the bearing or the distance to the target is considered. The performance of the controllers proposed is veriﬁed analytically, through simulations, and in an experimental setup.},

	abstract = {Consider an agent A at an unknown location, undergoing sufﬁciently slow drift, and a mobile agent B that must move to the vicinity of and then circumnavigate A at a prescribed distance from A. In doing so, B can only measure its distance from A, and knows its own position in some reference frame. This paper considers this problem, which has applications to surveillance and orbit maintenance. In many of these applications it is difﬁcult for B to directly sense the location of A, e.g. when all that B can sense is the intensity of a signal emitted by A. This intensity does, however provide a measure of the distance. We propose a nonlinear periodic continuous time control law that achieves the objective using this distance measurement. Fundamentally, (a) B must exploit its motion to estimate the location of A, and (b) use its best instantaneous estimate of where A resides, to move itself to achieve the ultimate circumnavigation objective. For (a) we use an open loop algorithm formulated by a subset of us in an earlier paper. The key challenge tackled in this paper is to design a control law that closes the loop by marrrying the dual goals. As long as the initial estimate of the source location is not coincident with the intial position of B, the algorithm is guaranteed to be exponentially convergent in the case that A is stationary. Under the same condition, we establish that when A drifts with a sufﬁciently small, unknown velocity, B globally achieves its circumnavigation objective, to within a margin proportional to the drift velocity. We further test the control law through simulations.},

	abstract = {Exact inference for hidden Markov models requires the evaluation of all distributions of interest - ﬁltering, prediction, smoothing and likelihood - with a ﬁnite computational eﬀort. This article provides suﬃcient conditions for exact inference for a class of hidden Markov models on general state spaces given a set of discretely collected indirect observations linked non linearly to the signal, and a set of practical algorithms for inference. The conditions we obtain are concerned with the existence of a certain type of dual process, which is an auxiliary process embedded in the time reversal of the signal, that in turn allows to represent the distributions and functions of interest as ﬁnite mixtures of elementary densities or products thereof. We describe explicitly how to update recursively the parameters involved, yielding qualitatively similar results to those obtained with Baum–Welch ﬁlters on ﬁnite state spaces. We then provide practical algorithms for implementing the recursions, as well as approximations thereof via an informed pruning of the mixtures, and we show superior performance to particle ﬁlters both in accuracy and computational eﬃciency. The code for optimal ﬁltering, smoothing and parameter inference is made available in the Julia package DualOptimalFiltering.},

The focus is on the case in which the mapping F is degenerate at some point (x∗, y∗) with respect to y, i.e., when Fy(x∗, y∗), the derivative of F with respect to y, is not invertible and, hence, the classical Implicit Function Theorem is not applicable. We present pth-order generalizations of the Implicit Function Theorem for this case. The second part of the paper uses these pth-order implicit function theorems to derive suﬃcient conditions for the existence of a solution of degenerate nonlinear boundary-value problems for second-order ordinary diﬀerential equations in cases close to resonance. The last part of the paper presents a modiﬁed perturbation method for solving degenerate second-order boundary value problems with a small parameter. The results of this paper are based on the constructions of p-regularity theory, whose basic concepts and main results are given in the paper Factor–analysis of nonlinear mappings: p–regularity theory by Tret’yakov and Marsden (Communications on Pure and Applied Analysis, 2 (2003), 425–445).},

	abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping problem for mobile robots has received considerable attention over the last decade. The widely used formulation of the SLAM problem has been the augmented state approach in an estimation theoretic framework. Although, many related issues of SLAM such as computational complexity, loop closing and data association have received much attention, the observability issue has largely remained ignored. System observability is an important aspect in any state estimation problem. Observability analysis provides for understanding of the fundamental limits of the solution obtainable, regardless of process and measurement noises. The standard world-centric SLAM formulation is a highly non-linear system. Thus the direct use of linear observability tools and criteria in the analysis of its observability yields incorrect and inconsistent results. In this paper an appropriate method of analysis of the observability of non-linear systems is applied to investigate the properties of the standard SLAM formulation. Contrary to popular belief, it is shown through theoretical analysis that the standard 2D planar world-centric SLAM formulation involving odometry inputs for robot speed and heading, and range/bearing measurements to features in the environment is unobservable. It is also shown that for the system to be observable, it requires at least two absolutely known feature point positions, thus questioning the very meaning implied by SLAM. The analytical results thus established are verified through simulations.},

In this paper, we ﬁrst introduce a functional characterization of observability for a POMP and show that this characterization is sufﬁcient to guarantee stability of the non-linear ﬁlter in a weak sense. Under further regularity conditions, we establish stability under the notions of weak convergence, total variation, and relative entropy; thus complementing and also unifying some existing results in the literature. In addition, we study controlled partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDP) to arrive at analogous stability once control, and hence non-Markovian dependence between random variables, is introduced into the system.

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) rely on low-level geometric features such as points, lines, and planes. They are unable to assign semantic labels to landmarks observed in the environment. Furthermore, loop closure recognition based on low-level features is often viewpoint-dependent and subject to failure in ambiguous or repetitive environments. On the other hand, object recognition methods can infer landmark classes and scales, resulting in a small set of easily recognizable landmarks, ideal for view-independent unambiguous loop closure. In a map with several objects of the same class, however, a crucial data association problem exists. While data association and recognition are discrete problems usually solved using discrete inference, classical SLAM is a continuous optimization over metric information. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem over sensor states and semantic landmark positions that integrates metric information, semantic information, and data associations, and decompose it into two interconnected problems: an estimation of discrete data association and landmark class probabilities, and a continuous optimization over the metric states. The estimated landmark and robot poses affect the association and class distributions, which in turn affect the robot-landmark pose optimization. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated on indoor and outdoor datasets.},

We consider Nonlinear Programming (NLP) and NLP sensitivity as natural tools for formulation and efﬁcient solution of optimization problems for these three tasks. For MHE, we develop a maximum likelihood formulation that directly incorporates nonlinear models, and is seamlessly adapted to updating the arrival costs. This approach is also extended easily to M-estimators, which essentially eliminate biased estimates due to gross errors. For NMPC, we develop formulations that incorporate wellunderstood stability and robustness properties, even for large, complex plant models. Finally, recent work has extended these capabilities from setpoint tracking objectives to more general stage costs that are economically based, thus leading to a robustly stable strategy for D-RTO. In concert with these problem formulations, the realization of MHE, NMPC and D-RTO requires the application of a fast NLP solver for time-critical, on-line optimization, as well as efﬁcient NLP sensitivity tools that eliminate computational delay, and guarantee stability and robustness. Algorithms that meet these demands are explored and outlined for these tasks. Finally, a number of challenging distillation case studies are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of these optimization-based strategies.},

	abstract = {Weak Feller property of controlled and control-free Markov chains lead to many desirable properties. In control-free setups this leads to the existence of invariant probability measures for compact spaces and applicability of numerical approximation methods. For controlled setups, this leads to existence and approximation results for optimal control policies. We know from stochastic control theory that partially observed systems can be converted to fully observed systems by replacing the original state space with a probability measure-valued state space, with the corresponding kernel acting on probability measures known as the non-linear ﬁlter process. Establishing suﬃcient conditions for the weak Feller property for such processes is a signiﬁcant problem, studied under various assumptions and setups in the literature. In this paper, we prove the weak Feller property of the non-linear ﬁlter process (i) ﬁrst under weak continuity of the transition probability of controlled Markov chain and total variation continuity of its observation channel, and then, (ii) under total variation continuity of the transition probability of controlled Markov chain. The former result (i) has ﬁrst appeared in Feinberg et. al. [Math. Oper. Res. 41(2) (2016) 656-681]. Here, we present a concise and easy to follow alternative proof for this existing result. The latter result (ii) establishes weak Feller property of non-linear ﬁlter process under conditions which have not been previously reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {Filter stability is a classical problem for partially observed Markov processes (POMP). For a POMP, an incorrectly initialized non-linear ﬁlter is said to be stable if the ﬁlter eventually corrects itself with the arrival of new measurement information. In the literature, studies on the stability of non-linear ﬁlters either focus on the ergodic properties on the hidden Markov process, or the informativeness/observability properties of the measurement channel. While notions of observability exist in the literature, they are often diﬃcult to verify and speciﬁc examples of observable systems are mostly restricted to additive noise models with additional strict regularity properties. In this paper, we introduce a general deﬁnition of observability for stochastic non-linear dynamical systems and compare it with related ﬁndings in the literature. Our observability notion involves a functional characterization which is easily computed for a variety of systems as we demonstrate. Under this observability deﬁnition we establish ﬁlter stability results for a variety of criteria including weak merging and total variation merging, both in expectation and in an almost sure sense, as well as relative entropy. We consider the implications between these notions, which unify various results in the literature in a concise manner. Our conditions, and the examples we study, complement and generalize the existing results on ﬁlter stability.},

In order to achieve fast convergence of the state estimates to the actual system state as well as the robustness of the observer to measurement and process noise, a deterministic (high-gain) observer is first applied for a small time period with continuous output measurements to drive the estimation error to a small value; after this initial small time period, a robust moving horizon estimation scheme is used on-line to provide more accurate and smoother state estimates. In the design of the robust moving horizon estimation scheme, the deterministic observer is used to calculate reference estimates and confidence regions that contain the actual system state. Within the confidence regions, the moving horizon estimation scheme is allowed to optimize its estimates. The output feedback economic model predictive controller is designed via Lyapunov techniques based on state estimates provided by the deterministic observer and the moving horizon estimation scheme. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed rigorously and conditions that ensure the closedloop stability are derived. Extensive simulations based on a chemical process example illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a unifying probabilistic framework for the design of robustly asymptotically stable moving-horizon estimators (MHE) for discrete-time nonlinear systems, and a mechanism to incorporate diﬀerential privacy in moving-horizon estimation. We begin with an investigation of the classical notion of strong local observability of nonlinear systems and its relationship to optimization-based state estimation. We then present a general moving-horizon estimation framework for strongly locally observable systems, as an iterative minimization scheme in the space of probability measures. This framework allows for the minimization of the estimation cost with respect to diﬀerent metrics. In particular, we consider two variants, which we name W2-MHE and KL-MHE, where the minimization scheme uses the 2-Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence, respectively. The W2-MHE yields a gradient-based estimator whereas the KL-MHE yields a particle ﬁlter, for which we investigate asymptotic stability and robustness properties. Stability results for these moving-horizon estimators are derived in the probabilistic setting, against the backdrop of the classical notion of strong local observability which, to the best of our knowledge, diﬀerentiates it from other previous works. We then propose a mechanism to encode diﬀerential privacy of the measurements used by the estimator via an entropy regularization of the MHE objective functional. In particular, we ﬁnd sufﬁcient bounds on the regularization parameter to achieve the desired level of diﬀerential privacy. Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of these estimators.},

	abstract = {Optimization-based state estimation is useful for nonlinear or constrained dynamic systems for which few general methods with established properties are available. The two fundamental forms are moving horizon estimation (MHE) which uses the nearest measurements within a moving time horizon, and its theoretical ideal, full information estimation (FIE) which uses all measurements up to the time of estimation. Despite extensive studies, the stability analyses of FIE and MHE for discretetime nonlinear systems with bounded process and measurement disturbances, remain an open challenge. This work aims to provide a systematic solution for the challenge. First, we prove that FIE is robustly globally asymptotically stable (RGAS) if the cost function admits a property mimicking the incremental input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS) of the system and has a sufﬁcient sensitivity to the uncertainty in the initial state. Second, we establish an explicit link from the RGAS of FIE to that of MHE, and use it to show that MHE is RGAS under enhanced conditions if the moving horizon is long enough to suppress the propagation of uncertainties. The theoretical results imply ﬂexible MHE designs with assured robust stability for a broad class of i-IOSS systems. Numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems are used to illustrate the designs and support the ﬁndings.},

The estimate that corresponds to the lowest cost is retained and propagated to the next time instant, where the procedure is repeated with the new information batch. The stability of the estimation error for the proposed moving-horizon estimator is proved under mild conditions concerning the observability of the free-noise state equation and the selection of a tuning parameter in the cost function.

	abstract = {The computational effort may result in an overwhelming issue that prevents to use moving-horizon state estimation in a wide range of applications. Thus, in this paper we investigate the potential of moving-horizon estimators that provide an estimate of the state variables after performing a simple descent step based on the gradient or Newton methods. The stability analysis usually drawn in the case of exact minimization of the cost function cannot be applied. Thus, novel conditions on the stability of the estimation error for moving-horizon estimation based on single or multiple iterations of the gradient and Newton algorithms are derived for discrete-time linear and nonlinear noise-free systems. In the case of the gradient method for nonlinear systems, global exponential stability of the estimation error can be ensured. By contrast, only local stability is proved for the Newton-based approach. Under linear assumptions, also the error given by this estimator is demonstrated to be globally exponentially stable. The theoretical results are veriﬁed also by means of simulations, with a chaotic nonlinear system used as a testbed to estimate all the state variables only by means of measurements of the ﬁrst one. The simulation results show that the gradient and Newton-based approaches perform quite well as compared with the extended Kalman ﬁlter.},

State estimators for most physical processes often must address many different challenges, including nonlinear dynamics, states subject to hard constraints (e.g. nonnegative concentrations), and local optima. In this article, we compare the performance of two such estimators: the extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) and moving horizon estimation (MHE). We illustrate conditions that lead to estimation failure in the EKF when there is no plant-model mismatch and demonstrate such failure via several simple examples. We then examine the role that constraints, the arrival cost, and the type of optimization (global versus local) play in determining how MHE performs on these examples. In each example, the two estimators are given exactly the same information, namely tuning parameters, model, and measurements; yet MHE consistently provides improved state estimation and greater robustness to both poor guesses of the initial state and tuning parameters in comparison to the EKF.},

Speciﬁcally, we introduce an additional predictive step that follows the standard online convex optimization step when certain conditions on the estimated gradient and descent direction are met. We show that under these conditions and without any assumptions on the predictability of the environment, the predictive update strictly improves on the performance of the standard update. We give two types of predictive update for various family of loss functions. We provide a regret bound for each of our predictive online convex optimization algorithms. Finally, we apply our framework to an example based on demand response which demonstrates its superior performance to a standard online convex optimization algorithm.},

A twolevel algorithm for optimizing the building’s energy management under uncertainty and limited information is presented in this paper. A mixed-integer linear program scheduling level is ﬁrst used to set an energy management objective for every hour using only averaged data. Then, an online convex optimization algorithm is used to track in real-time the objective set by the scheduling level. For this purpose, a novel penalty-based online convex optimization algorithm for time-varying constraints is developed. The regret of the algorithm is shown to be sublinearly bounded above. This ensures, at least on average, the feasibility of the decisions made by the algorithm. A case study in which the two-level approach is used on a building located in Melbourne, Australia is presented. The approach is shown to satisfy all constraints 97.32\% of the time while attaining a positive net revenue at the end of the day by providing ancillary services to the power grid.},

	abstract = {Safely deploying robots in uncertain and dynamic environments requires a systematic accounting of various risks, both within and across layers in an autonomy stack from perception to motion planning and control. Many widely used motion planning algorithms do not adequately incorporate inherent perception and prediction uncertainties, often ignoring them altogether or making questionable assumptions of Gaussianity. We propose a distributionally robust incremental sampling-based motion planning framework that explicitly and coherently incorporates perception and prediction uncertainties. We design output feedback policies and consider moment-based ambiguity sets of distributions to enforce probabilistic collision avoidance constraints under the worst-case distribution in the ambiguity set. Our solution approach, called Output Feedback Distributionally Robust RRT*(OFDR-RRT*), produces asymptotically optimal risk-bounded trajectories for robots operating in dynamic, cluttered, and uncertain environments, explicitly incorporating mapping and localization error, stochastic process disturbances, unpredictable obstacle motion, and uncertain obstacle locations. Numerical experiments illustrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

We will show that the values of these relaxations converge to the optimal value under a constraint qualiﬁcation. Although this convergence property is well known for polynomial problems with scalar constraints [5], to the best of our knowledge this result is new for matrix-valued inequalities. (We are aware of the parallel independent work of Kojima [6], that presents the same result with a diﬀerent proof.) The result allows for a systematic improvement of LMI relaxations of non-convex polynomial semi-deﬁnite programming problems with guaranteed reduction of the relaxation gap to zero. This can be applied to various very hard control problems that can be written as polynomial semideﬁnite programs (SDP’s), such as static or ﬁxed-order controller synthesis. We present a direct and compact description of the resulting linear SDP’s with full ﬂexibility in the choice of the underlying monomial basis. The method is illustrated with a non-convex quadratic SDP problem and with H2-optimal static controller synthesis.},

Automated experimental workﬂows and liquid handling enables unprecedented throughput, as well as the capacity to generate extremely large datasets. We seek to develop generalized identiﬁability conditions for informing the design of automated experiments to discover predictive nonlinear biological models. For linear systems, identiﬁability is characterized by persistence of excitation conditions. For nonlinear systems, no such persistence of excitation conditions exist. We use the input-Koopman operator method to model nonlinear systems and derive identiﬁability conditions for openloop systems initialized from a single initial condition. We show that nonlinear identiﬁability is intrinsically tied to the rank of a given dataset’s power spectral density, transformed through the lifted Koopman observable space. We illustrate these identiﬁability conditions with a simulated synthetic gene circuit model, the repressilator. We illustrate how rank degeneracy in datasets results in overﬁtted nonlinear models of the repressilator, resulting in poor predictive accuracy. Our ﬁndings provide novel experimental design criteria for discovery of globally predictive nonlinear models of biological phenomena.},

	abstract = {As autonomous systems rely increasingly on onboard sensing for localization and perception, the parallel tasks of motion planning and state estimation become increasingly coupled. This coupling is well-captured by augmenting the planning objective with a posteriorcovariance penalty – however, online evaluation and optimization can be challenging, particularly for observation models with latent environmental dependencies (e.g., opportunistic landmarks). This paper addresses a number of fundamental challenges in eﬃcient prediction and minimization of the posterior covariance particular to landmark- and SLAM-based estimators. First, we provide a measurement bundling approximation that enables high-rate sensors such as cameras to be approximated with fewer, low-rate updates. This also allows for landmark marginalization, for which we provide a novel recipe for computing the gradients necessary for optimization. Finally, we identify a class of measurement models for which the contributions from each landmark can be directly combined, making evaluation of the information gained at each timestep (nearly) independent of the number of landmarks. This opens the door for generalization to landmark distributions, foregoing the need for fully-speciﬁed linearization points. Taken together, these contributions allow SLAM estimators to be accurately and eﬃciently approximated, paving the way for online, observability-aware trajectory optimization.},

	abstract = {Distributionally-robust optimization is often studied for a ﬁxed set of distributions rather than timevarying distributions that can drift signiﬁcantly over time (which is, for instance, the case in ﬁnance and sociology due to underlying expansion of economy and evolution of demographics). This motivates understanding conditions on probability distributions, using the Wasserstein distance, that can be used to model time-varying environments. We can then use these conditions in conjunction with online stochastic optimization to adapt the decisions. We considers an online proximal-gradient method to track the minimizers of expectations of smooth convex functions parameterised by a random variable whose probability distributions continuously evolve over time at a rate similar to that of the rate at which the decision maker acts. We revisit the concepts of estimation and tracking error inspired by systems and control literature and provide bounds for them under strong convexity, Lipschitzness of the gradient, and bounds on the probability distribution drift characterised by the Wasserstein distance. Further, noting that computing projections for a general feasible sets might not be amenable to online implementation (due to computational constraints), we propose an exact penalty method. Doing so allows us to relax the uniform boundedness of the gradient and establish dynamic regret bounds for tracking and estimation error. We further introduce a constraint-tightening approach and relate the amount of tightening to the probability of satisfying the constraints.},

The use of a scenario tree to represent the uncertainty makes it possible to formulate a closed-loop robust approach with recourse which improves the open-loop approach in terms of performance and domain of attraction. We show that a straightforward formulation of a multi-stage NMPC scheme does not guarantee Input-to-State stability (ISS) in a deterministic setting, in contrast to the results that one gets using stochastic stability concepts. Since for many applications deterministic stability guarantees are desired, we provide an alternative formulation to achieve deterministic ISS and recursive feasibility guarantees for the case of discrete values of the uncertainty.

The focus is on the optimisation-based SLAM back end. The strategies are classified based on their purposes such as reducing the computational complexity, improving the convergence and improving the robustness. It is clearly pointed out that some approximations are made in some of the methods and there is always a trade-off between the computational complexity and the accuracy of the solution. The local submap joining is a strategy that has been used to address both the computational complexity and the convergence and is a flexible tool to be used in the SLAM back end. Although more research is needed to further improve the SLAM back end, nowadays there are quite a few relatively mature SLAM back end algorithms that can be used by SLAM researchers and users.},

	abstract = {Distributed as an open‐source library since 2013, real‐time appearance‐based mapping (RTAB‐Map) started as an appearance‐based loop closure detection approach with memory management to deal with large‐scale and long‐term online operation. It then grew to implement simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of constraints on sensors, processing capabilities, and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power, and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual‐ or lidar‐based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB‐Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB‐Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real‐world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB‐D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths, and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.},

Extending this fact to Wasserstein Newton’s ﬂows, we derive Newton’s Langevin dynamics. We provide examples of Newton’s Langevin dynamics in both one-dimensional space and Gaussian families. For the numerical implementation, we design sampling eﬃcient variational methods in aﬃne models and reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to approximate Wasserstein Newton’s directions. We also establish convergence results of the proposed information Newton’s method with approximated directions. Several numerical examples from Bayesian sampling problems are shown to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed method.},

For dynamical systems, we use the semi-measure of their Jacobian to characterize the contractivity properties of their trajectories. Second, for weakly contracting systems, we prove a dichotomy for the asymptotic behavior of their trajectories and novel sufﬁcient conditions for convergence to an equilibrium. Third, we show that every trajectory of a doubly-contracting system, i.e., a system that is both weakly and semi-contracting, converges to an equilibrium point. Finally, we apply our results to various important network systems including afﬁne averaging and afﬁne ﬂow systems, continuous-time distributed primaldual algorithms, and networks of diffusively-coupled dynamical systems.

We tethered foragers of Myrmecia croslandi on a trackball and recorded their intended movements when the trackball was located on their normal foraging corridor (on-route), above their nest and at a location several metres away where they have never been before (off-route). We found that at on- and off-route locations, most ants walk in the nest or foraging direction and continue to do so for tens of metres in a straight line. In contrast, above the nest, ants walk in random directions and change walking direction frequently. In addition, the walking direction of ants above the nest oscillates on a fine scale, reflecting search movements that are absent from the paths of ants at the other locations. An agentbased simulation shows that the behaviour of ants at all three locations can be explained by the integration of attractive and repellent views directed towards or away from the nest, respectively. Ants are likely to acquire such views via systematic scanning movements during their learning walks. The model predicts that ants placed in a completely unfamiliar environment should behave as if at the nest, which our subsequent experiments confirmed. We conclude first, that the ants’ behaviour at release sites is exclusively driven by what they currently see and not by information on expected outcomes of their behaviour; and second, that navigating ants might continuously integrate attractive and repellent visual memories. We discuss the benefits of such a procedure.},

            The navigational skills of ants, bees and wasps represent one of the most baffling examples of the powers of minuscule brains. Insects store long-term memories of the visual scenes they experience
            1
            , and they use compass cues to build a robust representation of directions
            2,3
            . We know reasonably well how long-term memories are formed, in a brain area called the Mushroom Bodies (MB)
            4–8
            , as well as how heading representations are formed in another brain area called the Central Complex (CX)
            9–12
            . However, how such memories and heading representations interact to produce powerful navigational behaviours remains unclear
            7,13,14
            . Here we combine behavioural experiments with computational modelling that is strictly based on connectomic data to provide a new perspective on how navigation might be orchestrated in these insects. Our results reveal a lateralised design, where signals about whether to turn left or right are segregated in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. Furthermore, we show that guidance is a two-stage process: the recognition of visual memories – presumably in the MBs – does not directly drive the motor command, but instead updates a “desired heading” – presumably in the CX – which in turn is used to control guidance using celestial compass information. Overall, this circuit enables ants to recognise views independently of their body orientation, and combines terrestrial and celestial cues in a way that produces exceptionally robust navigation.},

The result is a mechanism for going from the real system to an executable implementation that can be used for controlling multiple mobile robots.},

	abstract = {The visual systems of all animals are used to provide information that can guide behaviour. In some cases insects demonstrate particularly impressive visually-guided behaviour and then we might reasonably ask how the low-resolution vision and limited neural resources of insects are tuned to particular behavioural strategies. Such questions are of interest to both biologists and to engineers seeking to emulate insectlevel performance with lightweight hardware. One behaviour that insects share with many animals is the use of learnt visual information for navigation. Desert ants, in particular, are expert visual navigators. Across their foraging life, ants can learn long idiosyncratic foraging routes. What's more, these routes are learnt quickly and the visual cues that deﬁne them can be implemented for guidance independently of other social or personal information. Here we review the style of visual navigation in solitary foraging ants and consider the physiological mechanisms that underpin it. Our perspective is to consider that robust navigation comes from the optimal interaction between behavioural strategy, visual mechanisms and neural hardware. We consider each of these in turn, highlighting the value of ant-like mechanisms in biomimetic endeavours.},

The scenario considered assumes a possibly biased measurement of velocity along with bearing or direction measurements to one or multiple ﬁxed points in the environment. The motivating example is a robot moving in either two- or three-dimensional space with a sensor, such as a camera, capable of providing bearing but not distance to observed ﬁxed points in the environment. We provide a comprehensive observability analysis, and discuss stability and convergence of the observer design and observer error dynamics, under persistence of excitation conditions on the vehicle motion. Interestingly, we can show uniform observability even for a single direction measure and with unknown velocity bias as long as the vehicle trajectory is persistently exciting. Some extensions to the case of multiple directions with known or unknown observed point location are addressed and observers endowed with exponential stability of error dynamics are derived. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.},

However, several robot applications require them to traverse repeatedly in semi-static or dynamic environments. There has been some recent research interest in designing persistence ﬁlters to reason about persistence in such scenarios. Our goal in this work is to incorporate such persistence reasoning in visual SLAM. To this end, we incorporate persistence ﬁlters [1] into ORB-SLAM, a well-known visual SLAM algorithm. We observe that the simple integration of their proposal results in inefﬁcient persistence reasoning. Through a series of modiﬁcations and using two locally collected datasets, we demonstrate the utility of such persistence ﬁltering as well as our customizations in ORB-SLAM. Overall, incorporating persistence ﬁltering could result in a signiﬁcant reduction in map size (about 30\% in the best case) and a corresponding reduction in run-time while retaining similar accuracy to methods that use much larger maps.},

The characterisation of the unobservable directions is made using the nullspace basis of the stripped observability matrix. This allow us to identify which vehicle motions are required to maximise the number of observable states in the system, which in turn affects accuracy in the estimation process.

The cost function is usually made up of two contributions: a prediction error computed on a recent batch of inputs and outputs; an arrival cost that serves the purpose of summarizing the past data.

With increasing demand for robotic automation, research in this area has received much attention. Among the many factors that can be attributed to a high-performance robotic system, the planned sensing or acquisition of perceptions on the operating environment is a crucial component. The aim of sensor planning is to determine the pose and settings of vision sensors for undertaking a vision-based task that usually requires obtaining multiple views of the object to be manipulated. Planning for robot vision is a complex problem for an active system due to its sensing uncertainty and environmental uncertainty. This paper describes such problems arising from many applications, e.g. object recognition and modeling, site reconstruction and inspection, surveillance, tracking and search, as well as robotic manipulation and assembly, localization and mapping, navigation and exploration. A bundle of solutions and methods have been proposed to solve these problems in the past. They are summarized in this review while enabling readers to easily refer solution methods for practical applications. Representative contributions, their evaluations, analyses, and future research trends are also addressed in an abstract level.},

This approach includes constant time procedures to compute the distance between poses, the expected information gain for each potential link, and the exact marginal covariances while moving in open loop, as well as a procedure to recover the state after a loop closure that, in practical situations, scales linearly in terms of both time and memory. Using these procedures, the robot operates most of the time in open loop, and the cost of the loop closure is amortized over long trajectories. This way, the computational bottleneck shifts to data association, which is the search over the set of previously visited poses to determine good candidates for sensor registration. To speed up data association, we introduce a method to search for neighboring poses whose complexity ranges from logarithmic in the usual case to linear in degenerate situations. The method is based on organizing the pose information in a balanced tree whose internal levels are deﬁned using interval arithmetic. The proposed Pose-SLAM approach is validated through simulations, real mapping sessions, and experiments using standard SLAM data sets.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07452},
	abstract = {In the theory of Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), existence of optimal policies have in general been established via converting the original partially observed stochastic control problem to a fully observed one on the belief space, leading to a belief-MDP. However, computing an optimal policy for this fully observed model, and so for the original POMDP, using classical dynamic or linear programming methods is challenging even if the original system has ﬁnite state and action spaces, since the state space of the fully observed belief-MDP model is always uncountable. Furthermore, there exist very few rigorous approximation results, as regularity conditions needed often require a tedious study involving the spaces of probability measures leading to properties such as Feller continuity. In this paper, we rigorously establish near optimality of ﬁnite window control policies in POMDPs under mild non-linear ﬁlter stability conditions and the assumption that the measurement and action sets are ﬁnite (and the state space is real vector valued). We also establish a rate of convergence result which relates the ﬁnite window memory size and the approximation error bound, where the rate of convergence is exponential under explicit and testable geometric ﬁlter stability conditions. While there exist many experimental results and few rigorous asymptotic convergence results, an explicit rate of convergence result is new in the literature, to our knowledge.},

For inﬁnite domains the extension of the concept of distribution over all possible functions involves measurability issues and stochastic process theory. For countably inﬁnite domains, we prove that the natural extension of NFL theorems does not hold, but that a weaker form of NFL does hold, by stating the existence of non-trivial distributions of ﬁtness leading to equal performance for all search heuristics. Our main result is that for continuous domains, NFL does not hold.},

Furthermore, we study the same problem where not only doppler shift measurements are collected, but also other types of measurements are available, e.g. bearing or distance to the target from each of the sensors. Later, we study the Cramer-Rao inequality associated with the doppler-shift measurements to a target in a sensor network, and use the Cramer-Rao bound to illustrate some results on optimal placements of the sensors when the goal is to estimate the velocity of the target.

	abstract = {This paper investigates active localization of a stationary object using time delay alone or together with Doppler shift measurements observed by a number of dynamic monostatic sensors having collocated transmitters and receivers, where the sensor motion during the interrogation period is not negligible. Non-negligible motion effect appears when the sensor speed relative to the signal propagation speed is signiﬁcant, such as in an acoustic or an underwater environment. The motion effect causes the signal sent and received locations different, with their separation proportional to the two-way propagation time delay that is dependent on the object location. We ﬁrst provide new measurement models for time delay and Doppler shift in the presence of sensor motion. They come as recursive equations and their non-recursive forms are derived. Analysis of the motion effect based on the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is conducted, and the performance loss in terms of the location bias and variance when ignoring the sensor motion effect is evaluated. Two kinds of estimators for the object location are next proposed by exploiting the non-recursive forms of the model equations. One is a closed-form solution by algebraic evaluation and the other is a semi-deﬁnite relaxation solution by convex optimization. The ﬁrst is computationally efﬁcient and is shown to achieve the CRLB performance over the small error region under Gaussian noise, while the second can handle the positioning problem better when the noise level is high. Simulations validate the theoretical analysis and the performance of the proposed estimators.},

This paper focuses on the observability analysis of INS errors from implicit measurements of the optical ﬂow subspace constraint, and derives how observable and unobservable directions are affected by the motion of a camera rigidly coupled to an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Straight motion and piecewise constant (PWC) attitude segments yield the random constant IMU errors observable. The unobservable directions are the threedimensional (3D) position error, the velocity error along the ground velocity, and the combination of angular misalignment about the local vertical and the velocity error along the horizontal direction orthogonal to the ground velocity. The velocity error along the ground velocity becomes observable with horizontal maneuvering. A Monte Carlo simulation validates the observability analysis, and reveals the feasibility of IMU calibration and the mitigation of navigation error growth with the aid of the optical ﬂow subspace constraint compared with the unaided INS.},

Our relaxed definition is conceptually equivalent to the definition introduced in [25], but is easier to verify. It is useful for stability analysis of nonlinear systems that arise, for example, in nonlinear adaptive control, stabilization of nonholonomic systems, and tracking control.

Stochastic ﬁltering theory is brieﬂy reviewed with emphasis on nonlinear and non-Gaussian ﬁltering.

Under linear quadratic Gaussian circumstance, the celebrated Kalman ﬁlter can be derived within the Bayesian framework. Optimal/suboptimal nonlinear ﬁltering techniques are extensively investigated. In particular, we focus our attention on the Bayesian ﬁltering approach based on sequential Monte Carlo sampling, the so-called particle ﬁlters. Many variants of the particle ﬁlter as well as their features (strengths and weaknesses) are discussed. Related theoretical and practical issues are addressed in detail.

First, we transfer the real-time iteration approach, developed in Diehl et al. (2002) for nonlinear model predictive control, to the MHE approach to render it real-time feasible. The scheme reduces the computational burden to one iteration per measurement sample and separates each iteration into a preparation and an estimation phase. This drastically reduces the time between measurements and computed estimates. Secondly, we derive a numerically efﬁcient arrival cost update scheme based on one single QR-factorization. The MHE algorithm is demonstrated on two chemical engineering problems, a thermally coupled distillation column and the Tennessee Eastman benchmark problem, and compared against an Extended Kalman Filter. The CPU times demonstrate the real-time applicability of the suggested approach.},

The general formulation of IOC/IRL is described and the related methods are categorized based on a hierarchical approach. For this purpose, IOC methods are categorized under two classes, namely classic and modern approaches. The classic IOC is typically formulated for control systems, while IRL, as a modern approach to IOC, is considered for machine learning problems. Despite the presence of a handful of IOC/IRL methods, a comprehensive categorization of these methods is lacking. In addition to the IOC/IRL problems, this paper elaborates, where necessary, on other relevant concepts such as Learning from Demonstration (LfD), Imitation Learning (IL), and Behavioral Cloning. Some of the challenges encountered in the IOC/IRL problems are further discussed in this work, including ill-posedness, non-convexity, data availability, nonlinearity, the curses of complexity and dimensionality, feature selection, and generalizability.},

	abstract = {Feedback particle ﬁlter (FPF) is a numerical algorithm to approximate the solution of the nonlinear ﬁltering problem in continuous-time settings. In any numerical implementation of the FPF algorithm, the main challenge is to numerically approximate the so-called gain function. A numerical algorithm for gain function approximation is the subject of this paper. The exact gain function is the solution of a Poisson equation involving a probability-weighted Laplacian ∆ρ. The numerical problem is to approximate this solution using only ﬁnitely many particles sampled from the probability distribution ρ. A diﬀusion map-based algorithm was proposed by the authors in a prior work [60, 62] to solve this problem. The algorithm is named as such because it involves, as an intermediate step, a diﬀusion map approximation of the exact semigroup e∆ρ . The original contribution of this paper is to carry out a rigorous error analysis of the diﬀusion map-based algorithm. The error is shown to include two components: bias and variance. The bias results from the diﬀusion map approximation of the exact semigroup. The variance arises because of ﬁnite sample size. Scalings and upper bounds are derived for bias and variance. These bounds are then illustrated with numerical experiments that serve to emphasize the eﬀects of problem dimension and sample size. The proposed algorithm is applied to two ﬁltering examples and comparisons provided with the sequential importance resampling (SIR) particle ﬁlter.},

Our approach is based on the probabilistic interpretation of the moving horizon estimator and its analogy to the maximum a posteriori estimator. We derive a method to directly obtain the required uncertainties from the Hessian of the moving horizon estimation objective function. We showcase our novel approach with the challenging visual-inertial sensor fusion problem that commonly arises in visual navigation systems. The estimation performance is signiﬁcantly better compared to our previous results based on the extended Kalman ﬁlter.

To realize autonomous locomotion of robots in an unknown environment, they need to create an environment map while estimating self-pose with measured data. When the robot works in an area where many people exist, however, the measured data is frequently occluded by them and become insufﬁcient to achieve the SLAM. Applying moving horizon estimation to SLAM, when the measured data is insufﬁcient, the evaluation of the motion model becomes more dominant than that of the matching error of the measured data. To verify the effectiveness of SLAM based on MHE, we conduct experiments in the crowded area to compare the result with that of SLAM based on extended Kalman ﬁlter. Also, we applied sequential quadratic programming to the optimization to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed method. It was conﬁrmed that the computational complexity was reduced by about 88 \% compared to the trust region method.},

LRS measurement includes outliers and suffers from the intermittent observation; alleviation of their effect is required in order to localize a vehicle position with high accuracy. Proposed localization method merges multisampling data by exploiting MHE, which greatly reduces the effect of outliers and intermittent observation on localization using the data of other sampling. We show the efﬁcacy of proposed localization by numerical simulations and experiments.},

These sensors generally have various data delays and sampling rates. Additionally, the communication delays or time synchronization errors between the onboard computers signiﬁcantly affect the robustness and accuracy of localization for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, the simultaneous estimation of vehicle position and sensor delays using a Gaussian process based moving horizon estimation (GP-MHE) is presented. The GPMHE can estimate the unknown delays of multiple sensors with the resolution less than that of GP-MHE sampling rate. The localization performance of GP-MHE was conﬁrmed using fullvehicle simulator, then evaluated in a real vehicle experiment on a highway scenario. Experimental result veriﬁed the sufﬁcient localization accuracy of sub 0.3m using data that had irregular sampling rate and delay of more than 150ms.

With a known initial estimate of a robot being tracked, the extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) has been shown to perform adequately well to achieve the RL. However, with an arbitrary initial estimate, EKF performance may become unstable and/or require a high number of iterations to achieve an acceptable tracking error. In this paper, moving horizon estimation (MHE) has been adopted to achieve the RL objective. Although MHE has been highlighted in the literature to be computationally intractable, in this work, an efﬁcient algorithm based on Real Time Iteration (RTI) scheme has been exported using an automatic C code generation toolkit. The exported code is adapted for the RL problem and requires computational capacity of the order ones of milliseconds. The MHE performance is compared against the EKF in numerical simulations. Under arbitrary estimator initialization, the results conﬁrms that MHE over performs EKF in terms of the number of iterations required for convergence while satisfying the real-time requirements.},

In the sense of the multirate systems, some sensors may have no measurements at certain sampling times, which can be regarded as measurement missing and may signiﬁcantly degrade the estimation performance. A binary switching sequence is introduced to model the multirate sampling process, and an explicit mathematical description of this process is proposed where a prediction value activated by a prediction generator is used for the output of missing sampling for slow measurement. The prediction generator provides a set of predictions to make the estimation system achieve the desired performance. By choosing a cost function, the optimal estimator is obtained by solving a regularized least-squares problem with unconstraints. The constrained MMHE problem is studied by using the interior-point algorithm. The input-tostate stability is investigated for the optimal estimator in the presence of bounded disturbances and noises. Finally, a mobile robot tracking platform is designed, and both simulations and experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In addition, markers to be measured are frequently hidden from cameras by occlusion, then the position and heading angle of a vehicle cannot be uniquely determined because of failure to detect suﬃcient number of markers. Thus, robust estimation method is required which suppresses the inﬂuence of the white noise, the outlier and the occlusion. In this study, we introduce Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) using partial marker information of motion capture system. It optimizes the objective function using both the marker information in the evaluation range and the constraints on the robot dynamics. By virtue of introduction of constraints, even if the cameras fail to measure the actual state of the robot, the estimated value is determined by MHE. It is the diﬀerence from our previous research which assumed that suﬃcient number of markers are available. In this paper, we estimate the position of the vehicle robot by MHE using the information of the measured markers on the robot, even if several markers are hidden. We will prove the eﬀectiveness of the proposed method by comparing MHE with EKF.},

With limited onboard computation capabilities, a robot should also be able to limit the size of the map used for online localization and mapping. This paper addresses these challenges using a memory management mechanism, which identiﬁes locations that should remain in a Working Memory (WM) for online processing from locations that should be transferred to a Long-Term Memory (LTM). When revisiting previously mapped areas that are in LTM, the mechanism can retrieve these locations and place them back in WM for online SPLAM. The approach is tested on a robot equipped with a short-range laser rangeﬁnder and a RGB-D camera, patrolling autonomously 10.5 km in an indoor environment over 11 sessions while having encountered 139 people.},

We achieve global consistency in the estimate through online loop-closing and non-linear optimization. Furthermore, our system supports relocalization in a map that has been previously obtained and allows for continued SLAM operation. We evaluate our approach in terms of accuracy, relocalization capability and run-time efﬁciency on public indoor benchmark datasets and on newly recorded outdoor sequences.

Measurements of a 3D laser scanner are aggregated in local multiresolution maps by means of surfel-based registration. The local maps are used in a multi-level graph for allocentric mapping and localization. In order to incorporate corrections when reﬁning the alignment, the individual 3D scans in the local map are modeled as a sub-graph and graph optimization is performed to account for drift and misalignments in the local maps. Furthermore, in each sub-graph, a continuous-time representation of the sensor trajectory allows to correct measurements between scan poses. We evaluate our approach in multiple experiments by showing qualitative results. Furthermore, we quantify the map quality by an entropy-based measure.},

However, this intractability relaxes for a particular instance of stochastic systems, namely Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, provided reasonable problem dimensions are taken. This motivates extending available performance guarantees to this particular class of systems, which may also be used to approximate general nonlinear dynamics via gridding of state, observation, and control spaces. We demonstrate applicability of the novel closed-loop performance results on a particular example in healthcare decision making, which relies explicitly on the duality of the control decisions associated with Stochastic Optimal Control in weighing appropriate appointment times, diagnostic tests, and medical intervention for treatment of a disease modeled by a Markov Chain.},

This USV equipped with the UAV uses adaptive estimation to calculate the location and size of the mobile target. The USV system must circumnavigate the boundary of the target while forming a regular polygon. We design two algorithms: One for the adaptive estimation of the target using the UAV’s measurements and another for the control protocol to be applied by all USVs in their navigation.

	abstract = {Filter stability is a classical and extensively studied problem for partially observed Markov processes. For such a process, an incorrectly initialized non-linear ﬁlter is said to be stable if the ﬁlter eventually corrects itself with the arrival of new measurement information. This paper has three main contributions: (i) we introduce a general explicit deﬁnition of observability for stochastic non-linear dynamical systems which involves a functional characterization that is testable with little eﬀort. Under this observability deﬁnition we establish stability of one-step predictors under weak convergence. (ii) We establish new implications between various criteria for ﬁlter stability, notably in arriving from weak convergence of predictors to that of ﬁlters through weak Feller continuity of ﬁlter transitions, from weak merging to total variation merging for both the predictor and ﬁlters, and ﬁnally in establishing the equivalence of total variation merging and relative entropy merging. (iii) We then strengthen the stability results to involve weak merging and total variation merging, both in expectation and in an almost sure sense, as well as in relative entropy (which also has implications in the context of relative entropy convergence of Markov chains to invariant measures). Our conditions, and the examples we study, complement and generalize the existing results on ﬁlter stability and a detailed comparison is reported. Numerous examples are presented.},

We present explicit error bounds relating the approximation error to the length of the ﬁnite history window. We establish the convergence of such Q-learning iterations under mild ergodicity assumptions on the state process during the exploration phase. We further show that the limit ﬁxed point equation gives an optimal solution for an approximate belief-MDP. We then provide bounds on the performance of the policy obtained using the limit Q values compared to the performance of the optimal policy for the POMDP, where we also present explicit conditions using recent results on ﬁlter stability in controlled POMDPs. While there exist many experimental results, (i) the rigorous asymptotic convergence (to an approximate MDP value function) for such ﬁnite-memory Q-learning algorithms, and (ii) the near optimality with an explicit rate of convergence (in the memory size) are results that are new to the literature, to our knowledge.},

An important problem is to characterize the largest class of channels which admit coding and control policies so that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable. In this paper we consider the stability notion of (asymptotic) ergodicity. We prove lower bounds on the channel capacity necessary to achieve the stability criterion. Under mild technical assumptions, we obtain that the necessary channel capacity is lower bounded by the log-determinant of the linearization, double-averaged over the state and noise space. We prove this bound by introducing a modiﬁed version of invariance entropy, and utilizing the almost sure convergence of sample paths guaranteed by the pointwise ergodic theorem. Our results generalize those for linear systems, and are in some cases more reﬁned than those obtained for nonlinear systems via information-theoretic methods.},

The optimization problem required to be solved at each sampling instant is formulated into a backward nonlinear optimal control problem over the finite past. Once prior knowledge of the observed system is available, constraints can be further imposed. The highly efficient and accurate symplectic pseudospectral algorithm is taken as the core solver, which leads to the symplectic pseudospectral moving horizon estimation (SP-MHE) method. The developed SP-MHE is first evaluated by numerical simulations for a hovercraft. Then the developed method is extended to parameter estimation and applied to a chaotic system with an unknown parameter. Simulation results show that the SP-MHE can generate accurate estimations even under large sampling periods or large noise where regular filters fail. In addition, the SP-MHE exhibits excellent online efficiency, suggesting it can be used for scenarios where the sampling period is relatively small.},

While direct methods, popular in the literature, exhibit quadratic convergence and can be quite efﬁcient for sparse problems, they typically require a lot of storage as well as efﬁcient elimination orderings to be found. In contrast, iterative optimization methods only require access to the gradient and have a small memory footprint, but can suffer from poor convergence. Our new method, subgraph preconditioning, is obtained by re-interpreting the method of conjugate gradients in terms of the graphical model representation of the SLAM problem. The main idea is to combine the advantages of direct and iterative methods, by identifying a sub-problem that can be easily solved using direct methods, and solving for the remaining part using PCG. The easy sub-problems correspond to a spanning tree, a planar subgraph, or any other substructure that can be efﬁciently solved. As such, our approach provides new insights into the performance of state of the art iterative SLAM methods based on re-parameterized stochastic gradient descent. The efﬁciency of our new algorithm is illustrated on large datasets, both simulated and real.},

	abstract = {Condensation is a popular algorithm for sequential inference that resamples a sampled representation of the posterior. The algorithm is known to be asymptotically correct as the number of samples tends to inﬁnity. However, the resampling phase involves a loss of information. The sequence of representations produced by the algorithm is a Markov chain, which is usually inhomogeneous. We show simple discrete examples where this chain is homogeneous and has absorbing states. In these examples, the representation moves to one of these states in time apparently linear in the number of samples and remains there. This phenomenon appears in the continuous case as well, where the algorithm tends to produce “clumpy” representations. In practice, this means that diﬀerent runs of a tracker on the same data can give very diﬀerent answers, while a particular run of the tracker will look stable. Furthermore, the state of the tracker can collapse to a single peak — which has non-zero probability of being the wrong peak — within time linear in the number of samples, and the tracker can appear to be following tight peaks in the posterior even in the absence of any meaningful measurement. This means that, if theoretical lower bounds on the number of samples are not available, experiments must be very carefully designed to avoid these effects.},

Distance-based formation control with a collision-avoidance potential function is employed as a solution. A formation control protocol is devised and applied to the formation tracking problem. With the protocol, the vehicles form a desired formation around a moving target in order to continuously estimate its position, while the centroid of the formation tracks the target. Almost global stability is proved for the case with three tracking agents. A fully operational platform with four ASVs was built to implement the derived algorithms. One of the vehicles was used to simulate a target and the rest to form a triangular formation around it. Power usage of a naval vessel is highly affected by water resistance forces which increases signiﬁcantly with the velocity. This was accounted for by adding an additional term to the formation tracking protocol, thereby increasing the overall system endurance. Experimental results are presented.},

Such algorithm comprises of a decentralised least squares estimation of the target and a controller for circumnavigation. We prove the convergence of the robots to the circle and in equally spaced positions around it. Simulation results with data provided by the SINMOD ocean model are used to illustrate the theoretical results.},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of tracking a mobile target using adaptive estimation while circumnavigating it with a system of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). The mobile target considered is an irregular dynamic shape approximated by a circle with moving centre and varying radius. The USV system is composed of n USVs of which one is equipped with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capable of measuring both the distance to the boundary of the target and to its centre. This USV equipped with the UAV uses adaptive estimation to calculate the location and size of the mobile target. The USV system must circumnavigate the boundary of the target while forming a regular polygon. We design two algorithms: One for the adaptive estimation of the target using the UAV's measurements and another for the control protocol to be applied by all USVs in their navigation. The convergence of both algorithms to the desired state is proved up to a limit bound. Two simulated examples are provided to verify the performance of the algorithms designed in this paper.},

	abstract = {A moving-horizon state estimation problem is addressed for a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems with bounded noises acting on the system and measurement equations. As the statistics of such disturbances and of the initial state are assumed to be unknown, we use a generalized least-squares approach that consists in minimizing a quadratic estimation cost function deﬁned on a recent batch of inputs and outputs according to a sliding-window strategy. For the resulting estimator, the existence of bounding sequences on the estimation error is proved. In the absence of noises, exponential convergence to zero is obtained. Moreover, suboptimal solutions are sought for which a certain error is admitted with respect to the optimal cost value. The approximate solution can be determined either on-line by directly minimizing the cost function or off-line by using a nonlinear parameterized function. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with the extended Kalman ﬁlter.},

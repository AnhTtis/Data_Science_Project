    "abstract": "Integrated photonics is a powerful contender in the race for a fault-tolerant quantum computer, claiming to be a platform capable of scaling to the necessary number of qubits. This necessitates the use of high-quality quantum states, which we create here using an all-around high-performing photon source on an integrated photonics platform. We use a photonic molecule architecture and broadband directional couplers to protect against fabrication tolerances and ensure reliable operation. As a result, we simultaneously measure a spectral purity of $99.1 \\pm 0.1$ %, a pair generation rate of $4.4 \\pm 0.1$ MHz mW$^{-2}$, and an intrinsic source heralding efficiency of $94.0 \\pm 2.9$ %. We also see a maximum coincidence-to-accidental ratio of $1644 \\pm 263$. We claim over an order of magnitude improvement in the trivariate trade-off between source heralding efficiency, purity and brightness. Future implementations of the source could achieve in excess of $99$ % purity and heralding efficiency using state-of-the-art propagation losses.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that, near equilibrium condition could not be maintained for bulk viscous matter models during the accelerated expansion of the universe in the context of Einstein's gravity, without including the cosmological constant. But from our investigation in $f(R,T)$ gravity, it is observed that, this condition can be satisfied in this modified gravity regime by properly constraining the coupling and viscous parameters. Accordingly, strict constraints are developed for free parameters in bulk viscous models in $f(R,T)=R+2λT$ gravity based on fulfillment near equilibrium condition. Then, for assessing the validity of NEC during different stages of evolution, two cosmological models are studied for each case based on the developed constraints. Initially, the data analysis of the models is performed using the Observational Hubble Data (OHD) and then later, model showing the best result is analyzed using combined OHD+SNe Ia data sets. From the obtained best fit values of model parameters, inferences are made regarding the possibilities of achieving recent acceleration for viscous models in $R+2λT$ gravity while simultaneously satisfying the required conditions both in the presence and absence of cosmological constant.",

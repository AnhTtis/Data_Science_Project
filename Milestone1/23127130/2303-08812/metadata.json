    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have seen extensive applications in scientific data analysis, including in neutrino telescopes. However, the data from these experiments present numerous challenges to CNNs, such as non-regular geometry, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Consequently, CNNs are highly inefficient on neutrino telescope data, and require significant pre-processing that results in information loss. We propose sparse submanifold convolutions (SSCNNs) as a solution to these issues and show that the SSCNN event reconstruction performance is comparable to or better than traditional and machine learning algorithms. Additionally, our SSCNN runs approximately 16 times faster than a traditional CNN on a GPU. As a result of this speedup, it is expected to be capable of handling the trigger-level event rate of IceCube-scale neutrino telescopes. These networks could be used to improve the first estimation of the neutrino energy and direction to seed more advanced reconstructions, or to provide this information to an alert-sending system to quickly follow-up interesting events.",

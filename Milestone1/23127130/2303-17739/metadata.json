    "abstract": "We prove several rigidity results about the centralizer of a smooth diffeomorphism, concentrating on two families of examples: diffeomorphisms with transitive centralizer, and perturbations of isometric extensions of Anosov diffeomorphisms of nilmanifolds.\n  We classify all smooth diffeomorphisms with transitive centralizer: they are exactly the maps that preserve a principal fiber bundle structure, acting minimally on the fibers and trivially on the base.\n  We also show that for any smooth, accessible isometric extension $f_0\\colon M\\to M$ of an Anosov diffeomorphism of a nilmanifold, subject to a spectral bunching condition, any $f\\in \\mathrm{Diff}^\\infty(M)$ sufficiently $C^1$-close to $f_0$ has centralizer a Lie group. If the dimension of this Lie group equals the dimension of the fiber, then $f$ is a principal fiber bundle morphism covering an Anosov diffeomorphism.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we study the uniqueness and nondegeneracy of ground states to a fractional Choquard equation of the form: $(-Δ)^su+u=2(I_2\\star u^2)u$ where $s\\in(0,1)$ is sufficiently close to $1$. Our method is to make a continuation argument with respect to the power $s\\in(0,1)$ appearing in $(-Δ)^s$. This approach is based on [M. M. Fall and E. Valdinoci, Comm. Math. Phys., 329 (2014) 383-404].",

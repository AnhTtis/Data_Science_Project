    "abstract": "Traffic signs support road safety and managing the flow of traffic, hence are an integral part of any vision system for autonomous driving. While the use of deep learning is well-known in traffic signs classification due to the high accuracy results obtained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (state of the art is 99.46\\%), little is known about binarized neural networks (BNNs). Compared to CNNs, BNNs reduce the model size and simplify convolution operations and have shown promising results in computationally limited and energy-constrained devices which appear in the context of autonomous driving.\n  This work presents a bottom-up approach for architecturing BNNs by studying characteristics of the constituent layers. These constituent layers (binarized convolutional layers, max pooling, batch normalization, fully connected layers) are studied in various combinations and with different values of kernel size, number of filters and of neurons by using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) for training. As a result, we propose BNNs architectures which achieve more than $90\\%$ for GTSRB (the maximum is $96.45\\%$) and an average greater than $80\\%$ (the maximum is $88.99\\%$) considering also the Belgian and Chinese datasets for testing. The number of parameters of these architectures varies from 100k to less than 2M.

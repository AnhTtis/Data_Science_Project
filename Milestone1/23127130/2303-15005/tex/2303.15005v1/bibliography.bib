The system integrates auxiliary analyses such as points-to and may-happen-in-parallel, which are essential for increasing the accuracy of the aforementioned more complex properties. SACO provides accurate information about the dependencies which may introduce deadlocks, loops whose termination is not guaranteed, and upper bounds on the resource consumption of methods.",

The assignment of a virtual machine to physical machine impacts the energy consumption, the makespan, and the idle time of physical machines. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a three-dimension bin-packing optimization to minimize the energy cost of working machines and idle machines. By considering the CPU and memory requirements from a virtual machine, the assignment is constrained under the capacities of the physical machine. Inspired by the best-fit decreasing algorithm, four variants of this exact algorithm are developed to address the multiple-objective problem under multiple-capacity constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on small-, medium- and large-scale instances profiled from data centers. The results indicate that the algorithms assigning virtual machines to the physical machines of best-fit hosting time is competitive in cases with loose capacity constraints, and the energy-efficiency best-fit algorithm produces efficient assignments when a makespan limit is required on the physical machines. The algorithm combining the fit rules has a linear computing time concerning the numbers of physical and virtual machines, and a stable performance that obtains gaps of results lower than 5.8% compared to an on-the-shelf mixed-integer linear program solver."

This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours sometimes even minutesno matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the deployment pipeline, an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the ecosystem needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks. Coverage includes Automating all facets of building, integrating, testing, and deploying software Implementing deployment pipelines at team and organizational levels Improving collaboration between developers, testers, and operations Developing features incrementally on large and distributed teams Implementing an effective configuration management strategy Automating acceptance testing, from analysis to implementation Testing capacity and other non-functional requirements Implementing continuous deployment and zero-downtime releases Managing infrastructure, data, components and dependencies Navigating risk management, compliance, and auditing Whether youre a developer, systems administrator, tester, or manager, this book will help your organization move from idea to release faster than everso you can deliver value to your business rapidly and reliably. } }

Third, Zinc provides sophisticated type and instantiation checking which allows early detection of errors in models. Finally, perhaps the main novelty in Zinc is that it is designed to support a modelling methodology in which the same conceptual model can be automatically mapped into different design models, thus allowing modellers to easily ``plug and play'' with different solving techniques and so choose the most appropriate for that problem.

	abstract = "Minimizing the energy consumption of servers within cloud computing systems is of upmost importance to cloud providers toward reducing operational costs and enhancing service sustainability by consolidating services onto fewer active servers. Moreover, providers must also provision high levels of availability and reliability, hence cloud services are frequently replicated across servers that subsequently increases server energy consumption and resource overhead. These two objectives can present a potential conflict within cloud resource management decision making that must balance between service consolidation and replication to minimize energy consumption whilst maximizing server availability and reliability, respectively. In this paper, we propose a cuckoo optimization-based energy-reliability aware resource scheduling technique (CRUZE) for holistic management of cloud computing resources including servers, networks, storage, and cooling systems. CRUZE clusters and executes heterogeneous workloads on provisioned cloud resources and enhances the energy-efficiency and reduces the carbon footprint in datacenters without adversely affecting cloud service reliability. We evaluate the effectiveness of CRUZE against existing state-of-the-art solutions using the CloudSim toolkit. Results indicate that our proposed technique is capable of reducing energy consumption by 20.1% whilst improving reliability and CPU utilization by 17.1% and 15.7% respectively without affecting other Quality of Service parameters."

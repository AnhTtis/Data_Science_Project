    "abstract": "We define Poisson process models for outage and restore processes in power\nsystem resilience events in terms of their rates. These outage and restore\nprocesses easily yield the performance curves that track the evolution of\nresilience events, and their area, nadir and duration are standard resilience\nmetrics. We derive explicit and intuitive formulas for these metrics for mean\nperformance curves in terms of the model parameters; these parameters can be\nestimated from utility data. This clarifies the calculation of metrics of\ntypical resilience events, and shows what they depend on. We give examples of\nthe metric formulas using a typical model of transmission system outages with\nlognormal rate restoration, and also for constant rate and exponential rate\nrestorations. We give similarly nice formulas for the area metric for empirical\npower system data.",

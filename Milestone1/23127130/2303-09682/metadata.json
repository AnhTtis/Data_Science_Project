    "abstract": "Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are widely used in financial risk management, from estimating value-at-risk (VaR) to pricing over-the-counter derivatives. However, they come at a significant computational cost due to the number of scenarios required for convergence. Quantum MC (QMC) algorithms are a promising alternative: they provide a quadratic speed-up as compared to their classical counterparts. Recent studies have explored the calculation of common risk measures and the optimisation of QMC algorithms by initialising the input quantum states with pre-computed probability distributions. In this paper, we focus on incorporating scenario generation into the quantum computation by simulating the evolution of risk factors over time. Specifically, we assemble quantum circuits that implement stochastic models for equity (geometric Brownian motion), interest rate (mean-reversion models), and credit (structural and reduced-form credit models) risk factors. We then feed these scenarios to QMC simulations to provide end-to-end examples for both market and credit risk use cases.",

% In conclusion, we propose a new method called abstract safe control that enables ensuring persistent feasibility for high dimensional systems by consistent system abstraction. 
Our method provides a promising solution for ensuring safety in high-dimensional robotic tasks, with potential applications in various domains. In the future, we will explore how to derive the analytical upper bound of $\dot M_{max}$ to avoid the sampling-based estimation.

%In this section, the \ac{ber} performance of the proposed \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} system using \ac{rdm} is investigated. This \ac{ber} performance is compared with that of a \ac{siso} \ac{ofdm} system \cite{Van_Nee_OFDM, salehi2007digital, Diss_Hofbauer}, with that of a \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} system using \ac{esi}, and with that of a \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} system using the \ac{dsi} technique proposed in \cite{Hakobyan_A_novel_OFDM_MIMO_wo_CS}. For the latter one, we assume that the receiver perfectly knows the allocation of the Tx antennas to the subcarriers from the transmitter. 


In this section, the \ac{ber} performance of the proposed \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} system using \ac{ddm} is compared with that of a \ac{siso} \ac{ofdm} system and with that of \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} systems utilizing \ac{esi}, \ac{rdm}, and \ac{dsi} investigated in \cite{Hakobyan_A_novel_OFDM_MIMO_wo_CS}. For the latter one, it is assumed that the receiver knows the assignment of the subcarrier sets to the individual Tx antennas.
%The chosen parameters and additional processing blocks correspond to those utilized in \cite{Lang_RDM_JP} and are repeated in the following for the sake of completeness. 
All considered systems employ the system parameters listed in Tab.~\ref{Tab:com_sys_paramters} except for the \ac{siso} \ac{ofdm} system for which $N_\text{Tx} = 1$. 
%The \ac{siso} \ac{ofdm} system and the  \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} system utilizing \ac{esi} do  not add redundancy by means of \eqref{equ:Comm_OFDM_00111} since they do not face the problem of the constructive/destructive interference pattern described in Sec.~\ref{sec:Discussion_ECFR}.


Additional processing blocks, e.g., the channel coder/decoder \cite{Viterbi, salehi2007digital, Diss_Hofbauer}, the mapper/demapper \cite{allpress2004exact, Haselmayr_LLRs, Lang_Asilomar_2016_LLRs}, interleaver/deinterleaver, randomized \ac{cir} generation \cite{Rappaport_SISO_Channel, Rappaport_SISO_Channel_JP, Code_MIMO_Channels}, correspond to those utilized in \cite{Lang_RDM_JP} such that a detailed description can be omitted in this work. 


%Additional processing blocks correspond to those utilized in \cite{Lang_RDM_JP} and are briefly repeated in the following for the sake of completeness. All systems employ a convolutional channel code with coding rate $r = 1/2$, constraint length 7 and the generator polynomials $(133, 171)_8$ in octal representation in the transmitter \cite{salehi2007digital, Diss_Hofbauer}. The encoded bits are fed into a random interleaver with a block length equal to the number of coded bits per \ac{ofdm} symbol. The interleaved bits are mapped into binary data \ac{qpsk} symbols. At the receivers of all systems, a demapper evaluates the \acp{llr} from the estimated data symbols \cite{allpress2004exact, Haselmayr_LLRs, Lang_Asilomar_2016_LLRs}. A follow-up deinterleaver undoes the manipulations of the interleaver. The last processing block is a Viterbi decoder with soft decision decoding \cite{Viterbi}. 

%The employed model for randomized \ac{cir} generation is described in \cite{Rappaport_SISO_Channel, Rappaport_SISO_Channel_JP} and code for automated channel  generation is available in \cite{Code_MIMO_Channels}. In this code, we used the same parametrization as described in \cite{Lang_RDM_JP} such that a detailed description can be omitted in this work. The final \ac{ber} performances are evaluated by averaging over $5\,000$  \ac{los} and $5\,000$ \ac{nlos} channel realizations. For each one, a relative velocity is drawn from a uniform distribution between $\pm 60\, \text{m/s}$. The effects of this relative velocity on the channel are modelled in form of \ac{ici} and a \ac{cpe} \cite{Diss_Hofbauer}. One exception is the very last simulation, where \ac{ici} was disabled in order to investigate its effects on the \ac{ber} performance. 


The simulations are carried out for fixed values of $E_\text{b}/N_\text{0}$, where $E_\text{b}$ is the average energy per bit of information, and where $N_\text{0}/2$ is the double-sided noise power spectral density of a bandpass noise signal \cite{Diss_Hofbauer}. To obtain the desired value of $E_\text{b}/N_\text{0}$ the noise variance $\sigma_\text{n}^2$ of the complex-valued \ac{awgn} at the receiver input is chosen according to \cite{Miller_compl_BB, Diss_Hofbauer}
\begin{align}
	\sigma_\text{n}^2 = \frac{P_\text{s}}{(E_\text{b}/N_\text{0})br  \zeta \nu }. \label{equ:IEEE_CIR015a}	
\end{align}
There, $P_\text{s}$ represents the average signal power per time-domain sample measured at the receiver input. Moreover, $b$ is the number of bits per data symbol ($b=2$ for \ac{qpsk}), $r$ represents the code rate of the channel code, and  $\zeta= N_\text{c} / (N_\text{cp} + N_\text{c})$ accounts for the time domain samples in the \ac{cp}. The parameter $\nu$ accounts for the additional redundancy discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:Robust_DDM}. Thus, $\nu=\frac{1}{4}$ for the \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} system employing \ac{ddm}. \ac{rdm} adds a  similar redundancy \cite{Lang_RDM_JP}, such that $\nu=\frac{1}{4}$ is chosen also for the \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} system utilizing \ac{rdm}. All other considered systems do not add any additional redundancy such that $\nu=1$ is chosen for them. As a result, \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} systems employing \ac{ddm} and \ac{rdm} observe a higher noise variance $\sigma_\text{n}^2$. 

The \ac{ber} curves are simulated for three simulation scenarios detailed in the following.

\subsubsection{Perfect Channel Knowledge; Perfect Synchronization}

In this first simulation, the receiver perfectly knows the channel between transmitter and receiver. The observed \ac{ber} curves for uncoded and coded transmission are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BER_optimal}. While for the uncoded case \ac{rdm} has a small  advantage in \ac{ber} performance over \ac{ddm}, both systems feature approximately the same \ac{ber} performance in the coded case and outperform the remaining systems by approximately $1.6\, \text{dB}$. This gain in \ac{ber} performance is a result of the diversity gain elaborated on in Sec.~\ref{sec:Robust_DDM}.  

As argued in \cite{Lang_RDM_JP}, granting this diversity gain also to \ac{mimo} systems utilizing \ac{esi} and \ac{dsi} by means of adding additional redundancy would increase their \ac{ber} performances as well at the cost of a reduced data rate. %In fact, adding the same redundancy also to \ac{esi} would lead to a quite similar \ac{ber} performance as observed for \ac{rdm} and \ac{ddm}.


The remaining simulations are shown for coded transmission only, since uncoded transmission is not relevant for real-world applications.

\subsubsection{Perfect Synchronization; Imperfect Channel Estimation based on Preamble OFDM Symbols}

Now, the channel is not perfectly known but rather estimated using the procedure derived in Sec.~\ref{sec:channel_estimation}. The channel estimation procedure for the \ac{siso} \ac{ofdm} system is described in \cite{Diss_Hofbauer, Lang_Asilomar_2014}. The channels for the \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} systems utilizing \ac{esi} and \ac{dsi} are estimated with the \ac{blue} \cite{Kay-Est.Theory, Diss_Lang_Oliver}, whose derivations are omitted in this work.

For a fair comparison by means of having the similar distortions on the channel estimates, all three systems shall have the same effective \ac{snr} for the averaged preamble \ac{ofdm} symbols \cite{Lang_RDM_JP}. Hence, the increased noise variance $\sigma_\text{n}^2$ for the \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} systems with \ac{ddm} and \ac{rdm} is compensated by employing $N_\text{pr}=16$ preamble \ac{ofdm} symbols, while the other systems use $N_\text{pr}=4$. 

The resulting \ac{ber} curves are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BER_channel_estimation}. This figure also visualizes the simulation results for the case of perfect channel knowledge from Fig.~\ref{fig:BER_optimal} as reference. While the \ac{mimo} systems are less prone to imperfect channel knowledge, the loss in performance for all three systems is moderate\footnote{We note that in practice, not only the ECIRs but also the underlying CIRs may become highly time-varying for the assumed relative velocity between $\pm 60\,\text{m/s}$. This may entail the necessity of more frequent channel estimation or advanced channel tracking algorithms, whose analysis is beyond the scope of this work.}.

\subsubsection{Perfect Channel Knowledge; Imperfect Synchronization using Pilot Subcarriers}

Now, the channels are perfectly known, but the synchronization is performed using pilot subcarriers rather than having perfect synchronization. The \ac{siso} \ac{ofdm} system and the \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} systems utilizing \ac{esi} and \ac{dsi} employ $N_\text{p}=16$ pilot subcarriers. The \ac{mimo} \ac{ofdm} systems with \ac{ddm} and \ac{rdm} employ $N_\text{p}=64$ pilot subcarriers in order to ensure the same effective \ac{snr} as argued previously. The \ac{ber} curves visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:BER_synchronization} show that the loss in \ac{ber} performance is minor for all considered systems. 


\input{./fig/Fig_BER_synchronization}



\subsubsection{Perfect Channel Knowledge; Perfect CPE Synchronization; Disabled ICI}

The loss in \ac{ber} performance due to \ac{ici}-induced distortions is analyzed by disabling \ac{ici}, while the channel is assumed to be known and the \ac{cpe} is compensated perfectly. The resulting \ac{ber} curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:BER_woICI} indicate that the loss in \ac{ber} performance is negligible for all considered multiplexing methods with the chosen parametrization. 
%The reason for this behavior is the additional redundancy by means of transmitting the same data on 4 subcarriers in parallel. This causes an averaging of the \ac{ici}-induced distortions.

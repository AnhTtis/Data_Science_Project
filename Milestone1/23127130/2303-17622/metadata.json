    "abstract": "The newfound ability to detect SO2 in exoplanet atmospheres presents an opportunity to measure sulfur abundances and so directly test between competing modes of planet formation. In contrast to carbon and oxygen, whose dominant molecules are frequently observed, sulfur is much less volatile and resides almost exclusively in solid form in protoplanetary disks. This dichotomy leads different models of planet formation to predict different compositions of gas giant planets. Whereas planetesimal-based models predict roughly stellar C/S and O/S ratios, pebble accretion models more often predict superstellar ratios. To explore the detectability of SO2 in transmission spectra and its ability to diagnose planet formation, we present a grid of atmospheric photochemical models and corresponding synthetic spectra for WASP-39b (where SO2 has been detected). Our 3D grid contains 11^3 models (spanning 1--100x the solar abundance ratio of C, O, and S) for thermal profiles corresponding to the morning and evening terminators, as well as mean terminator transmission spectra. Our models show that for a WASP-39b-like O/H and C/H enhancement of ~10x Solar, SO2 can only be seen for C/S and O/S <~1.5, and that WASP-39b's reported SO2 abundance of 1--10 ppm may be more consistent with planetesimal accretion than with pebble accretion models (although some pebble models also manage to predict similarly low ratios). More extreme C/S and O/S ratios may be detectable in higher-metallicity atmospheres, suggesting that smaller and more metal-rich gas and ice giants may be particularly interesting targets for testing planet formation models. Future studies should explore the dependence of SO2 on a wider array of planetary and stellar parameters, both for the prototypical SO2 planet WASP-39b, as well as for other hot Jupiters and smaller gas giants.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we blend high-order Compact Approximate Taylor (CAT) numerical methods with the a posteriori Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) paradigm to solve hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The resulting methods are highly accurate for smooth solutions, essentially non-oscillatory for discontinuous ones, and almost fail-safe positivity preserving. Some numerical results for scalar conservation laws and systems are presented to show the appropriate behavior of CAT-MOOD methods.",

\maketitle

\abstract{In this paper we blend high-order Compact Approximate Taylor (CAT) numerical methods with the \textit{a posteriori} Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) paradigm to solve hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The resulting methods 
%present
are highly accurate for smooth solutions, essentially non-oscillatory for discontinuous ones, and almost fail-safe positivity preserving. 
Some numerical results for scalar conservation laws and systems are presented to show the appropriate behavior of CAT-MOOD methods.

\section{Conclusion and perspectives} \label{sec:conclusion}
% Conclusions
In this paper we have presented a combination between the \aposteriori shock-capturing MOOD technique  and the one-step high-order finite-difference CAT2P schemes. CAT2P schemes are of order $2P$ on smooth solutions, but, \raph{an} extra dissipative mechanism must be supplemented to deal with steep gradients or discontinuous solutions.
In this work we rely on an \aposteriori MOOD paradigm which computes an unlimited high-order candidate solution at time $t^{n+1}$, and, further detects troubled cells which are recomputed with a lower-order scheme throughout a family of detectors.
For a proof of concept, we tested the so-called \raph{CATMOOD6 scheme based on the } 'cascade': 
%of schemes: 
CAT6$\rightarrow$CAT2$\rightarrow \,$ 1st, where the last scheme is a first order robust scheme.
%The resulting MOOD scheme is called CATMOOD6. \\
%We have tested 
\raph{This scheme has been challenged}
%this scheme 
on a test suite of smooth solutions (linear scalar equation), simple shock waves (Burgers' equation), and complex self-similar solutions involving contact, shock and rarefaction waves (Sod problem).
In all test cases, CATMOOD6 has preserved the accuracy on smooth parts of the solutions, an essentially-non-oscillatory behavior close to steep gradients, and, \raph{always produces} a physically valid solution.
\gio{A detailed analysis of the improvement in the efficiency over standard slope limiters has not been performed. 
A two dimensional implementation, as well as other generalizations and  improvements are  under way.}

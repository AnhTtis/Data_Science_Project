    "abstract": "At a large displacement field, in rhomboedral and Bernal-stacked graphene a normal paramagnetic state transitions to a correlated state. Recent experiments showed that such systems have several phase transitions as a function of the carrier density. The phase adjacent to a paramagnetic state has anomalously high resistance and reduced degeneracy of the Fermi sea. We show that both phenomena can be explained through a concept of partial intervalley exciton condensation: a fraction of particles condenses into excitons, and another forms an intervalley coherent Fermi liquid. The exciton part of the system do not contribute to the electrical current thus increasing the resistance. Within this paradigm, the increase in the resistance has entirely geometrical origin. We check validity of the phenomenological theory through numerical calculations. We also show that the quantum oscillation data should not be very different between the partial excitonic state and the intervalley coherent states suggested by other authors. Further, we suggest STM/AFM or Raman spectroscopy to have a conclusive evidence for the occurrence of the partial exciton condensation that we suggest in this paper.",

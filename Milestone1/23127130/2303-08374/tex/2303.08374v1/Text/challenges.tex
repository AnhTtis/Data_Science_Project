\section{Challenges}

The key challenge addressed in this paper is: \textit{Can we improve the interface between a DL framework and communication backends with a single unified framework built on top of PyTorch?}. We seek to create an extensible framework that encapsulates all MPI and NCCL functionality. To answer this broad question, we solve the following concrete challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the key communication needs of modern distributed DL models and frameworks? Do existing distributed DL frameworks provide these needs?
    
    \item Can a unified framework improve rapid prototyping for DL parallelism schemes while enabling mixed-backend communications?
    
    \item What benefits can mixed-backend communications provide to improve DL training throughput?
\end{itemize}

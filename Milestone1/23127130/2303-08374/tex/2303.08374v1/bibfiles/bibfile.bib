@article{dl-review-nature,
    Abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of
multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels
of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in
speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other
domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate
structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate
how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the
representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep
convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video,
speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data
such as text and speech.},

abstract = {Explore new techniques in Microsoft's open source library called DeepSpeed, which advances large model training by improving scale, speed, cost, and usability, unlocking the ability to train 100-billion-parameter models. DeepSpeed is compatible with PyTorch. One piece of our library, called ZeRO, is a new parallelized optimizer that greatly reduces the resources needed for model and data parallelism while massively increasing the number of parameters that can be trained. Researchers have used these breakthroughs to create Turing Natural Language Generation (Turing-NLG), which at the time of its release was the largest publicly known language model at 17 billion parameters. In addition we will also go over our latest transformer kernel advancements that led the DeepSpeed team to achieve the world fastest BERT pretraining record.The Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) is a novel memory optimization technology for large-scale distributed deep learning. ZeRO can train deep learning models with over 100 billion parameters on the current generation of GPU clusters at three to five times the throughput of the current best system. It also presents a clear path to training models with trillions of parameters, demonstrating an unprecedented leap in deep learning system technology.DeepSpeed brings state-of-the-art training techniques, such as ZeRO, optimized kernels, distributed training, mixed precision, and checkpointing, through lightweight APIs compatible with PyTorch. With just a few lines of code changes to your PyTorch model, you can leverage DeepSpeed to address underlying performance challenges and boost the speed and scale of your training.},

abstract = {Unified Parallel C (UPC) is an emerging parallel programming language that is based on a shared memory paradigm. MPI has been a widely ported and dominant parallel programming model for the past couple of decades. Real-life scientific applications require a lot of investment by domain scientists. Many scientists choose the MPI programming model as it is considered low-risk. It is unlikely that entire applications will be re-written using the emerging UPC language (or PGAS paradigm) in the near future. It is more likely that parts of these applications will be converted to newer models. This requires that underlying implementation of system software be able to support both UPC and MPI simultaneously. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art of UPC and MPI interoperability leaves much to be desired both in terms of performance and ease-of-use.In this paper, we propose "Integrated Native Communication Runtime" (INCR) for MPI and UPC communications on InfiniBand clusters. Our library is capable of supporting both UPC and MPI communications simultaneously. This runtime is based on the widely used MVAPICH (MPI over InfiniBand) Aptus runtime, which is known to scale to tens-of-thousands of cores. Our evaluation reveals that INCR is able to deliver equal or better performance compared to the existing UPC runtime - GASNet on InfiniBand verbs. We observe that with UPC NAS benchmarks CG and MG (class B) at 128 processes, we outperform current GASNet implementation by 10% and 23%, respectively.},

abstract={CUDA-aware Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries like MVAPICH2-GDR have rapidly evolved to keep up with the demand for  efficient GPU buffer-based communication by incorporating the latest  technological advances to drive down communication latency  significantly. However, with the advent of Deep Learning (DL),  vendors have started to introduce libraries that are DL-focused, but  not MPI-compliant {\&}{\#}x2013; like the NVIDIA Collective Communications  Library (NCCL). Furthermore, there is a lack of a single common  standardized benchmarking tool to evaluate the performance of both  MPI and NCCL operations.  In this work, we introduce a new set of  collective benchmarks within OSU-Micro Benchmarks (OMB) to evaluate  the performance of NCCL operations in a manner that is semantically  equivalent to MPI benchmarks. We then tackle the challenge to see if  modern CUDA-aware MPI libraries like MVAPICH2-GDR can take advantage  of advances in collective communications libraries like NCCL to  provide high-performance MPI-compliant collective communication  primitives for High-Performance Computing (HPC) and DL applications.  We incorporate the ability to invoke NCCL API into  MVAPICH2-GDR{\&}{\#}x2019;s tuning framework in order to select the best  algorithm for any given message size. Finally, we evaluate the  performance of our designs by investigating the improvement in  latency at different message sizes and scales on the Lassen  supercomputing system using OMB. The designs developed as a part of  this thesis will be made available in future releases of MVAPICH2-GDR  and OMB. },

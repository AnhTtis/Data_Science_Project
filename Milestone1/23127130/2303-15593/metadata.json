    "abstract": "We consider limits of certain measures supported on lattice points in lattice polyhedra defined as the intersection of half-spaces $\\{m\\in\\mathbb{R}^n|\\langle v_i,x\\rangle+a_i \\geq 0\\}$, where $\\sum_i v_i = 0$. The measures are densities associated to lattice random variables obtained by restriction of multinomial random variables. We find the limiting Gaussian distributions explicitly.",

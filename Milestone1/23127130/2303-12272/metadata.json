    "abstract": "In recent years, the gravitational collapse of pebble clumps in the early Solar System has been regarded as a plausible scenario for the origin of comets. In this context, ``pebbles'' represent mm- to cm-sized dust aggregates composed of (sub)micron-sized dust particles, and the structure of km-sized comets is thought to be an agglomerate of pebbles. The contact radius for pebble-pebble contacts was modelled in an earlier study; however, the pressure dependence of the interpebble contact radius was not considered. Here, we revisit the interpebble contact radius in a comet nucleus. We calculated the interpebble contact radius based on JKR contact theory, and we took into consideration the effect of lithostatic pressure. We found that the interpebble contact radius varies with depth from the surface, and the earlier model underestimated it by one order of magnitude at the centre of the comet nucleus.",

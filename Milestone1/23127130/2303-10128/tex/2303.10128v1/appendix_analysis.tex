\subsection{The impact of the unsupervised filter}
\label{app:no_filter}

\autoref{tab:coll_comparison_pud} and \autoref{tab:coll_comparison_cv} show the impact of the unsupervised filter in the optional filter. PUD is a controlled setting for the impact of the filter because it is a collection where tokens are of high quality compared to CV. Thus we expect that the impact of the optional filter is low in PUD. Unexpectedly, the number of tokens reduces substantially (a reduction of the order of thousands) in Chinese, Japanese and Korean. An additional drastic reduction in the observed alphabet size in these languages strongly suggests that the optional filter is not adequate for them.  
For these reasons, we believe we should not apply the unsupervised filter to these languages because their writing system is essentially a syllabary. We suspect that the actual need for the exclusion could be a combination of sampling problems relating to a large alphabet size (compared to the Latin script) and a heavy- tailed rank distribution that breaks the optional filter. It is well-known that the rank distribution of Chinese characters is long-tailed, spanning two orders of magnitude \parencite{Deng2014a}, while that of phonemes (the counterpart of letters in many languages using the Latin script) is exponential-like \parencite{Naranan1993,Balasubrahmanyan1996}.
However, that issue should be the subject of future research. 

In CV, we find that the optional filter has a similar impact in languages concerning the reduction in the number of tokens but higher impacts concerning the reduction of the alphabet sizes, suggesting that presence of strings with strange characters. The three languages with the most marked reduction  in alphabet size are French, Spanish, German and Italian, with an alphabet size greater then 100.

\subsection{Mean word length and the law of abbreviation}
\label{sec:opt_scores}

In \autoref{tab:opt_scores_pud}, \autoref{tab:opt_scores_cv_characters} and \autoref{tab:opt_scores_cv_meadianDuration}, we show the mean word length ($L$) and the random baseline ($L_r$) as well as the outcome of the correlation test between length and frequency for PUD and for CV when length is measured in characters and also in duration, respectively.

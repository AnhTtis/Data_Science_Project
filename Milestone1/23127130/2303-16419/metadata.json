    "abstract": "We investigate the notion of involutive weak globular $ω$-categories via T.Leinster's approach: as algebras for the initial contracted globular operad in the bicategory of globular collections induced by the Cartesian monad of the free involutive strict $ω$-category functor on globular $ω$-sets. An apparently more restrictive notion of involutive weak globular $ω$-categories as algebras for the initial operadic-contraction in the bicategory of globular contracted-collections induced by the previous Cartesian monad (where here the operadic multiplications and units satisfy further compatibility axioms with the contractions) is also considered.",

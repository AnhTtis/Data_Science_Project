    "abstract": "After decades of study, there are only two known mechanisms to induce global synchronization in a population of oscillators: deterministic coupling and common forcing. The inclusion of independent random forcing in these models typically serves to drive disorder, increasing the stability of the incoherent state. Here we show that the reverse is also possible. We propose and analyse a simple model of purely noise coupled oscillators whose linear response around incoherence is identical to that of the paradigmatic Kuramoto model, but which exhibits binary phase locking instead of full coherence. We characterise the phase diagram, stationary states and approximate low dimensional dynamics for the model, revealing the curious behaviour of this new mechanism of synchronization.",

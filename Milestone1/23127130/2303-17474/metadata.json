    "abstract": "We show that among the derived equivalent classes of homologically smooth and proper graded gentle algebras there is only one class whose perfect derived category does not admit silting objects. This allows us to construct a family of examples where a pre-silting object cannot be completed into a silting object. As another application we confirm a conjecture by Lekili and Polishchuk that the geometric invariants which they construct for homologically smooth and proper graded gentle algebras are a complete derived invariant.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Smart-Tree, a supervised method for approximating the medial axes of branch skeletons from a tree's point cloud. A sparse voxel convolutional neural network extracts each input point's radius and direction towards the medial axis. A greedy algorithm performs robust skeletonization using the estimated medial axis. The proposed method provides robustness to complex tree structures and improves fidelity when dealing with self-occlusions, complex geometry, touching branches, and varying point densities. We train and test the method using a multi-species synthetic tree data set and perform qualitative analysis on a real-life tree point cloud. Experimentation with synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the robustness of our approach over the current state-of-the-art method. Further research will focus on training the method on a broader range of tree species and improving robustness to point cloud gaps. The details to obtain the dataset are at https://github.com/uc-vision/synthetic-trees.",

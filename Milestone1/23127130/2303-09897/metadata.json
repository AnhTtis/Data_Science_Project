    "abstract": "We study the spectral properties of sparse random graphs with different topologies and type of interactions, and their implications on the stability of complex systems, with particular attention to ecosystems. Specifically, we focus on the behaviour of the leading eigenvalue in different type of random matrices (including interaction matrices and Jacobian-like matrices), relevant for the assessment of different types of dynamical stability. By comparing the results on Erdos-Renyi and Husimi graphs with antagonistic or mixture interactions, we introduce a sufficient criterion, called local sign stability, for stability not to be affected by system size, as traditionally implied by the complexity-stability trade-off in conventional models of random matrices. This criterion generally holds for all graphs with locally tree-like structures and antagonistic or unidirectional interactions. In addition, for locally sign stable graphs, we observe that the leading eigenvalue undergoes a transition from being real to acquiring a nonnull imaginary part, which implies a dynamical transition from nonoscillatory to oscillatory linear response to perturbations. Lastly, we ascertain the discontinuous nature of this transition.",

    abstract = { In this paper, we introduce a stochastic projected subgradient method for weakly convex (i.e., uniformly prox-regular) nonsmooth, nonconvex functions---a wide class of functions which includes the additive and convex composite classes. At a high level, the method is an inexact proximal-point iteration in which the strongly convex proximal subproblems are quickly solved with a specialized stochastic projected subgradient method. The primary contribution of this paper is a simple proof that the proposed algorithm converges at the same rate as the stochastic gradient method for smooth nonconvex problems. This result appears to be the first convergence rate analysis of a stochastic (or even deterministic) subgradient method for the class of weakly convex functions. In addition, a two-phase variant is proposed that significantly reduces the variance of the solutions returned by the algorithm. Finally, preliminary numerical experiments are also provided. }

abstract = {In this paper, we study the Kurdyka---{{\L}}ojasiewicz (KL) exponent, an important quantity for analyzing the convergence rate of first-order methods. Specifically, we develop various calculus rules to deduce the KL exponent of new (possibly nonconvex and nonsmooth) functions formed from functions with known KL exponents. In addition, we show that the well-studied Luo---Tseng error bound together with a mild assumption on the separation of stationary values implies that the KL exponent is $$frac{1}{2}$$12. The Luo---Tseng error bound is known to hold for a large class of concrete structured optimization problems, and thus we deduce the KL exponent of a large class of functions whose exponents were previously unknown. Building upon this and the calculus rules, we are then able to show that for many convex or nonconvex optimization models for applications such as sparse recovery, their objective function's KL exponent is $$frac{1}{2}$$12. This includes the least squares problem with smoothly clipped absolute deviation regularization or minimax concave penalty regularization and the logistic regression problem with $$ell _1$$ℓ1 regularization. Since many existing local convergence rate analysis for first-order methods in the nonconvex scenario relies on the KL exponent, our results enable us to obtain explicit convergence rate for various first-order methods when they are applied to a large variety of practical optimization models. Finally, we further illustrate how our results can be applied to establishing local linear convergence of the proximal gradient algorithm and the inertial proximal algorithm with constant step sizes for some specific models that arise in sparse recovery.},

In the context of Banach spaces admitting equivalent Fréchet differentiable norms estimates for the generalized gradient \$\partial m\$ of m are established. A special study is made of problems in which the multifunctions defining the constraints take convex values. For these problems, estimates for \$\partial m\$ are given in terms of the generalized gradients of the support functions of these multifunctions. }

    abstract = { The notion of a sharp, or strongly unique, minimum is extended to include the possibility of a nonunique solution set. These minima will be called weak sharp minima. Conditions necessary for the solution set of a minimization problem to be a set of weak sharp minima are developed in both the unconstrained and constrained cases. These conditions are also shown to be sufficient under the appropriate convexity hypotheses. The existence of weak sharp minima is characterized in the cases of linear and quadratic convex programming and for the linear complementarity problem. In particular, a result of Mangasarian and Meyer is reproduced that shows that the solution set of a linear program is always a set of weak sharp minima whenever it is nonempty. Consequences for the convergence theory of algorithms are also examined, especially conditions yielding finite termination. }

    abstract = { This paper deals with a general framework for inexact forward--backward algorithms aimed at minimizing the sum of an analytic function and a lower semicontinuous, subanalytic, convex term. Such a framework relies on an implementable inexactness condition for the computation of the proximal operator and on a linesearch procedure, which is possibly performed whenever a variable metric is allowed into the forward--backward step. The main focus of this work is the convergence of the considered scheme without additional convexity assumptions on the objective function. Toward this aim, we employ the recent concept of forward--backward envelope to define a continuously differentiable surrogate function, which coincides with the objective at its stationary points and satisfies the so-called Kurdyka--Łojasiewicz (KL) property on its domain. We adapt the abstract convergence scheme usually exploited in the KL framework to our inexact forward--backward scheme, prove the convergence of the iterates to a stationary point of the problem, and prove the convergence rates for the function values. Finally, we show the effectiveness and the flexibility of the proposed framework on a large-scale image restoration test problem. }

    abstract = { Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference in Markov random field (MRF) lays the foundation for many computer vision tasks, which can be formulated by a binary quadratic programming (BQP) problem. Compared with the discrete methods, the continuous relaxation scheme becomes popular due to its generality and efficiency. However, existing continuous relaxation based MAP algorithms are still limited by two problems, i.e., the highly nonconvex original objective function and the gap between the original BQP problem and the relaxed continuous optimization problem. Targeting the two problems, this paper presents a doubly graduated continuous relaxation algorithm for MAP inference in MRF, which are, respectively, the Gaussian smoothing based graduated nonconvexity process and conditional gradient ascent based graduated projection. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images illustrate the algorithm's state-of-the-art performance in objective function optimization and typical computer vision tasks. }

Application of a primal-dual subgradient algorithm to a suitable decomposition of the objective functional into the difference of two convex functions leads to an algorithm which provably converges with parallel updates to binary solutions. Numerical results demonstrate robustness against local minima and excellent reconstruction performance using five projections within a range of 90∘. Our approach is applicable to quite general objective functions over binary variables with constraints and thus applicable to a wide range of problems within and beyond the field of discrete tomography.}

    abstract = { The projection onto the intersection of sets generally does not allow for a closed form even when the individual projection operators have explicit descriptions. In this work, we systematically analyze the projection onto the intersection of a cone with either a ball or a sphere. Several cases are provided where the projector is available in closed form. Various examples based on finitely generated cones, the Lorentz cone, and the cone of positive semidefinite matrices are presented. The usefulness of our formulae is illustrated by numerical experiments for determining copositivity of real symmetric matrices. }

    abstract = { We consider a class of nonsmooth optimization problems over the Stiefel manifold, in which the objective function is weakly convex in the ambient Euclidean space. Such problems are ubiquitous in engineering applications but still largely unexplored. We present a family of Riemannian subgradient-type methods---namely Riemannian subgradient, incremental subgradient, and stochastic subgradient methods---to solve these problems and show that they all have an iteration complexity of \$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})\$ for driving a natural stationarity measure below \$\varepsilon\$. In addition, we establish the local linear convergence of the Riemannian subgradient and incremental subgradient methods when the problem at hand further satisfies a sharpness property and the algorithms are properly initialized and use geometrically diminishing stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first convergence guarantees for using Riemannian subgradient-type methods to optimize a class of nonconvex nonsmooth functions over the Stiefel manifold. The fundamental ingredient in the proof of the aforementioned convergence results is a new Riemannian subgradient inequality for restrictions of weakly convex functions on the Stiefel manifold, which could be of independent interest. We also show that our convergence results can be extended to handle a class of compact embedded submanifolds of the Euclidean space. Finally, we discuss the sharpness properties of various formulations of the robust subspace recovery and orthogonal dictionary learning problems and demonstrate the convergence performance of the algorithms on both problems via numerical simulations. }

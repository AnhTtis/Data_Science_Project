    "abstract": "Dark matter halos are common in galaxies and globular clusters, making it possible to use dark matter density profiles to construct transverse wormholes. In reference [1], an approximate solution of the traversable wormhole satisfying the isotropic pressure condition is constructed by using the dark matter density profile. However, approximate solutions limit the discussion of traversable wormholes to a large extent. In this work, we construct the exact solution of the traversable wormhole in the case of rotation in the dark matter halo. We have written analytical expressions for the Kerr-like traversable wormhole metric for the dark matter density profile in galaxies corresponding to different dark matter models, respectively. These rotating traversable wormholes are jointly determined by the dark matter characteristic density and the scale radius. At the same time, we have also analyzed the energy conditions satisfied by these rotationally traversable wormholes.",

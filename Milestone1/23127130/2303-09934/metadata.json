    "abstract": "We consider the bimodal language, where the first modality is interpreted by a binary relation in the standard way, and the second is interpreted by the relation of inequality. It follows from Hughes (1990), that in this language, non-$k$-colorability of a graph is expressible for every finite $k$. We show that modal logics of classes of non-$k$-colorable graphs (directed or non-directed), and some of their extensions, are decidable.",

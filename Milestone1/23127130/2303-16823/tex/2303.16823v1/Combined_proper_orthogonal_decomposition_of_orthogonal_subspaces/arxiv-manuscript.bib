abstract = {A physical definition of "large eddy" is given which is optimal in a sense and which leads to the application of the proper orthogonal decomposition (Loeve) to turbulent velocity fields. This decomposition is in mutually uncorrelated eigenfunctions of the autocorrelation tensor, which are identified as the large eddies. In coordinate directions which are homogeneous the decomposition is the fustumary Fourier-Stieltjes integral while in coordinate directions in which the field is of finite extent it is discrete. A differential equation may be obtained for these eigenfunctions in parallel flow. By formal expansion in amplitude, the dynamics of these eigenfunctions recalls the work of Malkus (Spiegel). By taking the most energetic eigenfunction to be small and taking approximate account of the effect of all the rest with an undetermied parameter, an equation similar to the samll-disturbance stability equation is obtianed for the first eigenfunction; the "turbulent Reynolds number" (in a neutrally buoyant shear flow) is determined by requiring that only the first mode should be excited, and neutral. This gives results reminiscent of Townsend.},

abstract="Parallel numerical software based on the message passing model is enormously complicated. This paper introduces a set of techniques to manage the complexity, while maintaining high efficiency and ease of use. The PETSc 2.0 package uses object-oriented programming to conceal the details of the message passing, without concealing the parallelism, in a high-quality set of numerical software libraries. In fact, the programming model used by PETSc is also the most appropriate for NUMA shared-memory machines, since they require the same careful attention to memory hierarchies as do distributed-memory machines. Thus, the concepts discussed are appropriate for all scalable computing systems. The PETSc libraries provide many of the data structures and numerical kernels required for the scalable solution of PDEs, offering performance portability.",

abstract="An analysis of the near-wall behavior of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) eigenfunctions derived from direct numerical simulation (DNS) of channel flow is performed. Consistent with previous studies, a low order multi-mode reconstruction of the kinetic energy and Reynolds shear stress suffices. A similar reconstruction of the isotropic dissipation rate is shown to be insufficient, however. An analysis is performed of the multi-mode composition of the dissipation rate in the near-wall region, and it is shown that a significant number of higher order modes are required to achieve the correct asymptotic consistency in the near-wall region. The reconstructed turbulent moments are used to determine the eddy viscosity damping required in the near-wall region, and this is compared to the damping function extracted directly from the DNS results. It is noted that with a Reynolds number similarity of the low order eigenfunctions, the range of applicability of the results extends beyond the Reynolds number range of the DNS data.",

It is demonstrated that the standard SIMPLEC scheme [1] is inconsistent when applied on collocated grids. Hence, for steady computations the computed solution depends on the velocity underrelaxation parameter f u , whereas the solutions of unsteady computations for small time steps are polluted by unphysical wiggles. A revised scheme is proposed that extends the capability of the SIMPLEC method to cope with collocated grids in a general and consistent way. The efficiency of the new scheme is demonstrated by computing flows past a circular cylinder and an airfoil. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Finite-volume calculations of laminar separated flow around a fence are presented using a non-staggered grid system. Using the pressure-weighted interpolation method (PWIM), the role of the under-relaxation factor in this method has been studied. The performance of two pressure-velocity coupling algorithms, viz. SIMPLE and PISO, have been compared as well as the solution fields obtained using non-staggered and staggered grids. A detailed study has been conducted to investigate the occurrence of physically unrealistic convective velocities in the solution fields. The numerical results show that solutions obtained using non-staggered grids are as accurate as those obtained using staggered grids. The presence of very small under/overshoots in the estimated convective fluxes is related to the simultaneous presence of high Péclét numbers and rapidly varying pressure gradients. However, for the complex separated flow investigated, no induced errors were detected in the solution field.},

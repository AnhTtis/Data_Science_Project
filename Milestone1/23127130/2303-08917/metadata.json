    "abstract": "Quantum thermodynamics seeks to extend non-equilibrium stochastic thermodynamics to small quantum systems where non-classical features are essential to its description. Such a research area has recently provided meaningful theoretical and experimental advances by exploring the wealth and the power of quantum features along with informational aspects of a system's thermodynamics. The relevance of such investigations is related to the fact that quantum technological devices are currently at the forefront of science and engineering applications. This short review article provides an overview of some concepts in quantum thermodynamics highlighting test-of-principles experiments using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.",

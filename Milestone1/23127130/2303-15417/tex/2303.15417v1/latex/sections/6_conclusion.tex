\section{Conclusion}
We present the BlurHand dataset, containing realistic blurry hand images with 3D GTs, and the baseline network BlurHandNet.
Our BlurHandNet regards a single blurry hand image as sequential hands to utilize the temporal information from sequential hands, which makes the network robust to the blurriness.
%To this end, we propose Unfolder and temporal joint Transformer~(KTFormer).
Experimental results show that BlurHandNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in estimating 3D meshes from the newly proposed BlurHand and real-world test sets.

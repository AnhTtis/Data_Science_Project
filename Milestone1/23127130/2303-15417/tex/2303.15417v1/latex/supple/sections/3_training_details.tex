\section{Training details}
\label{sec:training_details}
% 
% All experiments are done under PyTorch~\cite{paszke2019pytorch} framework.

\noindent\textbf{BlurHandNet.}
% 
% We use Adam optimizer~\cite{kingma2014adam} with a batch size of 48 for training our BlurHandNet.

% 
The initial learning rate is set to $1\times 10^{-4}$ and reduced by a factor of $10$ at the $10\textit{th}$ and $12\textit{th}$ epochs.
% 
The proposed network is trained for 13 epochs and takes about 5.7 hours using two NVIDIA 2080 Ti GPUs.
% 
All other details will be available in our codes.

\noindent\textbf{State-of-the-art models.}
% 
% For training the state-of-the-art 3D hand mesh estimation networks~\cite{moon2022accurate, lin2021end, moon2020i2l} and deblurring networks~\cite{chen2022simple} on BlurHand, we follow their official training instruction.

% 
% In addition, we employ the authors' official pre-trained weight in training deblurring methods~\cite{chen2022simple} for easier optimization.

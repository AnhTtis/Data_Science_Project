\section{Visualization in video format}
\label{sec_supp:video_results}
% 
% We present the video clips showing the recovered 3D meshes of our BlurHandNet with the blurry input in the supplementary videos~(\textbf{\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont BlurHandNet.mp4}).
In the supplementary videos~(\textbf{\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont BlurHandNet.mp4}), we visualize the recovered 3D hand mesh sequence as video clips. 
% 
In the video, we note that the left part is the input blurry hand image, and the right part is the results from our BlurHandNet.
% 
We further note that we adopt linear interpolation to smooth the motion, and motion order is determined in the order of $\mathbf{V}_{\text{E1}}$, $\mathbf{V}_{\text{M}}$, and $\mathbf{V}_{\text{E2}}$.
% 

The video shows that our BlurHandNet outputs robust 3D hand meshes from challenging blurry hand.
% 
Moreover, our BlurHandNet successfully estimates the motion in the blurry hand by performing temporal unfolding through the proposed Unfolder.
% 
Compared to the previous methods, which output the mesh in the static scene, our BlurHandNet gives more accurate and comprehensive results from blurry inputs, including motion information.

\section{Conclusion}  
\vspace{-3pt}
We investigate open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation and propose a powerful solution named OPSNet. We develop exquisite designs like Embedding Modulation, Spatial Adapter and Mask Pooling, Mask Filtering, and Decoupled Supervision. The superior quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate its effectiveness and generality.

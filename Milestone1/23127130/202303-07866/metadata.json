    "abstract": "Outside the area of exponential asymptotics, the concept of the higher-order\nStokes phenomenon remains somewhat esoteric. The intention of this work is to\nprovide several examples of relatively simple ordinary differential equations\nwhere the phenomenon arises, and to develop additional practical methodologies\nfor its study.\n  In particular, we show how the higher-order Stokes phenomenon may be derived\nthrough the hyperterminant representation of the late-term divergence of an\nasymptotic expansion developed by Olde Daalhuis (J. Comp. Appl. Math. vol. 76,\n1996, pp. 255-264). Lower-order components of the factorial-over-power\ndivergence are considered, for which late-late-term divergence arises. Borel\nresummation of these lower-order components reveals the higher-order Stokes\nphenomenon, in which new components of the late-terms of the expansion are\nsmoothly switched on with an error function dependence. The techniques are\nfirstly demonstrated with a second-order linear inhomogeneous ODE that\nexemplifies the simplest example of higher-order Stokes phenomena. Further\nexamples studied include higher-order equations and eigenvalue problems.",

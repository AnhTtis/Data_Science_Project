    "abstract": "A decade ago, it was shown that associated with any model for $\\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamics there is a unique $\\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model formulated in terms of chiral and complex linear superfields. Here we study the ${\\cal N}=1$ superconformal $σ$-model analogue of the conformal duality-invariant electrodynamics known as the ModMax theory. We derive its dual formulation in terms of chiral superfields and show that the target space is a Kähler cone with $\\mathsf{U}(1)\\times \\mathsf{U}(1)$ isometry group.",

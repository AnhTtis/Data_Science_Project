\subsection{Bug localization in memory systems} \label{subsec:memory_accuracy}

For this setup, top-1 accuracy in both methodologies was
of 100\%. Cases of bug-free architecture obtain low confidence scores
in all possible locations, if a model to classify as
``Bug-Free'' using the same methodologies discussed in
Section~\ref{subsec:no_bug_handling} is included, it achieves
100\% detection rate without false negatives. Although this is a small setup for localization of bugs in memory
systems, its results show that the methodologies presented here are
robust for usage in different system components, as well as different
simulation frameworks.

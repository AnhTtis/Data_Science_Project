\subsection{Accuracy on Low Impact Bugs} \label{subsec:overall_accuracy}

In this section, we analyze the accuracy of our methodologies
for bugs with smaller average IPC impact ($>0.1\%$).
The results for this case are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:top_k_gt01}.

Overall, across all the evaluated bugs, the Ensemble method provides
the highest top-3 accuracy with a 72.5\%. The advantages of the Ensemble
are prominent on the cases of ``unseen bug types'' (Figure~\ref{fig:unseen_type_acc}) and ``seen bug variations'' 
(Figure~\ref{fig:seen_acc}). In this case, just as observed in
Section~\ref{subsec:per_impact_accuracy}, the ``unseen bug types''
are the hardest to localize accurately. Although CBC (GBDT) performs
slightly better than the Ensemble for ``unseen
variations of seen bug types'' (Figure~\ref{fig:unseen_var_acc}), when
all the cases are considered, the Ensemble methodology outperforms it in
this average IPC impact.

As it can be observed by contrasting Figures~\ref{fig:per_ipc_1} and~\ref{fig:top_k_gt01}, the results degrade when bugs with
smaller impact are considered. However, we believe that the our 
results 
are satisfactory given that a 0.1\% IPC impact can be negligible in most
situations.

When each technique is used individually, CBC~(GBDT) is the
best performing, being able to identify the correct location of the
bug in the top-3 ranked options in around 80\% of the cases when a 
similar bug (but not the exact same) was used for training the models.
Although the accuracy achieved by P2BC is not as high as the obtained
by CBC, it provides satisfactory results while using $100\times$ less
storage.

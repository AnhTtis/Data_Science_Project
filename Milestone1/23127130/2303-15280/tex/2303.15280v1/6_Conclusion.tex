\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{sec:conclusion}

Here, we presented two automated methodologies for processor
performance bug localization leveraging ML, the first
work of this kind to the best of our knowledge.  Our methodologies
extract information from legacy designs in order to learn the
relationships between performance counter behavior and locations of
performance bugs.  Between the approaches, one is more accurate while
another is $10\times$ faster and has $100\times$ smaller data
footprint.  An ensemble of two of the methodologies was also analyzed, and it was 
found to provide
further accuracy improvement.  Simulation results on the evaluated
bugs show that the top-3 accuracy achieved is as high as 90\% for bugs
with average IPC impact greater than 1\%, and 72\% for bugs with
impact greater than 0.1\%.

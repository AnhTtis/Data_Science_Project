    "abstract": "This paper analyzes multiple deep-syntactic frameworks with the goal of creating a proposal for a set of universal semantic role labels. The proposal examines various theoretic linguistic perspectives and focuses on Meaning-Text Theory and Functional Generative Description frameworks.\n  For the purpose of this research, data from four languages is used -- Spanish and Catalan (Taule et al., 2011), Czech (Hajic et al., 2017), and English (Hajic et al., 2012). This proposal is oriented towards Universal Dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2021) with a further intention of applying the universal semantic role labels to the UD data.",

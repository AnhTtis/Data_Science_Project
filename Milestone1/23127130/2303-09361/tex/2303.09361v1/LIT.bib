	abstract = {The LIT method has allowed ab initio calculations of electroweak cross sections in light nuclear systems. This review presents a description of the method from both a general and a more technical point of view, as well as a summary of the results obtained by its application. The remarkable features of the LIT approach, which make it particularly efficient in dealing with a general reaction involving continuum states, are underlined. Emphasis is given on the results obtained for electroweak cross sections of few-nucleon systems. Their implications for the present understanding of microscopic nuclear dynamics are discussed.}

It is applied to the trinucleon system for nucleons interacting through realistic soft core potentials. The convergence of the method is carefully studied. Binding energies, electric form factors, one body densities, two body correlation functions and two body photodisintegration are calculated for various potentials.},

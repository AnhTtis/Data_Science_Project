abstract = {The International Network of Nuclear Reaction Data Centres (NRDC) coordinated by the IAEA Nuclear Data Section (NDS) successfully collaborates in the maintenance and development of the EXFOR library. As the scope of published data expands (e.g. to higher energy, to heavier projectile) to meet the needs of research and applications, it has become a challenging task to maintain both the completeness and accuracy of the EXFOR library. Evolution of the library highlighting recent developments is described.}

	abstract = {We develop a class of emulators for solving quantum three-body scattering problems. They are based on combining the variational method for scattering observables and the recently proposed eigenvector continuation concept. The emulators are first trained by the exact scattering solutions of the governing Hamiltonian at a small number of points in its parameter space, and then employed to make interpolations and extrapolations in that space. Through a schematic nuclear-physics model with finite-range two and three-body interactions, we demonstrate the emulators to be extremely accurate and efficient. The computing time for emulation is on the scale of milliseconds (on a laptop), with relative errors ranging from 10−13 to 10−4 depending on the case. The emulators also require little memory. We argue that these emulators can be generalized to even more challenging scattering problems. Furthermore, this general strategy may be applicable for building the same type of emulators in other fields, wherever variational methods can be developed for evaluating physical models.},

When applied to the K-matrix only, our emulator resembles the one constructed by Furnstahl et al. (2020) [29] although with reduced numerical noise. After a few applications to real potentials, we emulate differential cross sections for 40Ca(n,n) scattering based on a realistic optical potential and quantify the model uncertainties using Bayesian methods.

In particular, by applying the Rayleigh-Ritz or Kohn variational principle, both bound and scattering states can be addressed, using either local or non-local interactions. Thanks to this versatility, the method can be used to test the two- and three-nucleon components of the nuclear interaction. In the present review we introduce the formalism of the HH method, both for bound and scattering states. In particular, we describe the implementation of the method to study the A = 3 and 4 scattering problems. Second, we present a selected choice of results of the last decade, most representative of the latest achievements. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of what we believe will be the most significant developments within the HH method for the next 5–10 years.},

	isbn = {978-3-540-65035-5},
	abstract = {This work was first published in 1947 in German under the title "Re­ chenmethoden der Quantentheorie". It was meant to serve a double purpose: to help both, the student when first confronted with quantum mechanics and the experimental scientist, who has never before used it as a tool, to learn how to apply the general theory to practical problems of atomic physics. Since that early date, many excellent books have been written introducing into the general framework of the theory and thus indispensable to a deeper understanding. It seems, however, that the more practical side has been somewhat neglected, except, of course, for the flood of special monographs going into broad detail on rather restricted topics. In other words, an all-round introduction to the practical use of quantum mechanics seems, so far, not to exist and may still be helpful. It was in the hope of filling this gap that the author has fallen in with the publishers' wish to bring the earlier German editions up to date and to make the work more useful to the worldwide community of science students and scientists by writing the new edition in English. From the beginning there could be no doubt that the work had to be much enlarged. New approximation methods and other developments, especially in the field of scattering, had to be added. It seemed necessary to include relativistic quantum mechanics and to offer, at least, a glimpse of radiation theory as an example of wave field quantization.},

Fully quantum-mechanical four-body breakup calculations reproduce the energy and angular differential cross sections below Erel∼1 MeV for both targets. The model used here reproduces the 6He ground-state properties as well as α-n and n-n scattering data and predicts an average opening angle 〈θnn〉 of 68∘ between the two halo neutrons. However, the model underestimates the breakup cross sections for higher Erel, indicating a possible contribution from the inelastic breakup. Alternatively, we examine the empirically modified calculations that reproduce the energy-differential cross sections for a wide range of scattering angles for both targets. The extracted B(E1) peaks at Erel∼1.4 MeV and amounts to 1.6(2) e2fm2 for Erel ≤ 20 MeV, resulting 〈θnn〉 = 56−10+9 degrees.

	abstract = {The total photo-absorption cross section of 4He is evaluated microscopically using two- (NN) and three-nucleon (NNN) interactions based upon chiral effective field theory (χEFT). The calculation is performed using the Lorentz integral transform method along with the ab initio no-core shell model approach. An important feature of the present study is the consistency of the NN and NNN interactions and also, through the Siegert theorem, of the two- and three-body current operators. This is due to the application of the χEFT framework. The inclusion of the NNN interaction produces a suppression of the low-energy peak and enhancement of the high-energy tail of the cross section. We compare to calculations obtained using other interactions and to representative experiments. The rather confused experimental situation in the giant resonance region prevents discrimination among different interaction models.},

	abstract = {This work was first published in 1947 in German under the title "Re chenmethoden der Quantentheorie". It was meant to serve a double purpose: to help both, the student when first confronted with quantum mechanics and the experimental scientist, who has never before used it as a tool, to learn how to apply the general theory to practical problems of atomic physics. Since that early date, many excellent books have been written introducing into the general framework of the theory and thus indispensable to a deeper understanding. It seems, however, that the more practical side has been somewhat neglected, except, of course, for the flood of special monographs going into broad detail on rather restricted topics. In other words, an all-round introduction to the practical use of quantum mechanics seems, so far, not to exist and may still be helpful. It was in the hope of filling this gap that the author has fallen in with the publishers' wish to bring the earlier German editions up to date and to make the work more useful to the worldwide community of science students and scientists by writing the new edition in English. From the beginning there could be no doubt that the work had to be much enlarged. New approximation methods and other developments, especially in the field of scattering, had to be added. It seemed necessary to include relativistic quantum mechanics and to offer, at least, a glimpse of radiation theory as an example of wave field quantization.},

	abstract = {Techniques are proposed for solving integral equations of the first kind with an input known not precisely. The requirement that the solution sought for includes a given number of maxima and minima is imposed. It is shown that when the deviation of the approximate input from the true one is sufficiently small and some additional conditions are fulfilled the method leads to an approximate solution that is necessarily close to the true solution. No regularization is required in the present approach. Requirements on features of the solution at integration limits are also imposed. The problem is treated with the help of an ansatz proposed for the derivative of the solution. The ansatz is the most general one compatible with the above mentioned requirements. The techniques are tested with exactly solvable examples. Inversions of the Lorentz, Stieltjes, and Laplace integral transforms are performed, and very satisfactory results are obtained. The method is useful, in particular, for the calculation of quantum-mechanical reaction amplitudes and inclusive spectra of perturbation-induced reactions in the framework of the integral transform approach.},

We present an ab initio calculation of the nuclear polarization for μ4He+ leading to an energy correction in the 2S−2P transitions of δApol=−2.47 meV ±6\%. We use two different state-of-the-art nuclear Hamiltonians and utilize the Lorentz integral transform with hyperspherical harmonics expansion as few-body methods. We take into account the leading multipole contributions, plus Coulomb, relativistic, and finite-nucleon-size corrections. Our main source of uncertainty is the nuclear Hamiltonian, which currently limits the attainable accuracy. Our predictions considerably reduce the uncertainty with respect to previous estimates and should be instrumental to the μ4He+ experiment planned for 2013.},

We investigate the dependence of the results on three different interactions, including chiral potentials, and we report on the 4He electric dipole polarizability calculated in the SA-NCSM that reproduces the experimental data and earlier theoretical outcomes. We also detail a novel use of the Lawson procedure to remove the spurious center-of-mass contribution to the sum rules that arises from using laboratory-frame coordinates.

Typical examples are the calculation of inclusive and semiexclusive scattering cross sections in atomic nuclei and transport properties of nuclear and neutron star matter. Integral transform techniques play an important role in accessing the spectral density in a variety of nuclear systems. However, their accuracy is in practice limited by the need to perform a numerical inversion which is often ill-conditioned. In the present work we extend a recently proposed quantum algorithm which circumvents this problem. We show how to perform controllable reconstructions of the spectral density over a finite energy resolution with rigorous error estimates. An appropriate expansion in Chebyshev polynomials allows for efficient simulations also on classical computers. We apply our idea to obtain the local density of states for graphene in a magnetic field as a proof of principle. This paves the way for future applications in nuclear and condensed matter physics.},

These are the first calculations beyond the threshold region in which both three-nucleon (3N) and Coulomb forces are fully included. We employ two realistic NN potentials (configuration space BonnA, AV18) and two 3N potentials (UrbanaIX, Tucson-Melborne). Complete final state interactions are taken into account via the Lorentz integral transform technique. We study relativistic corrections arising from first-order corrections to the nuclear charge operator. In addition the reference frame dependence due to our nonrelativistic framework is investigated. For q⩽350MeV/c we find that 3N forces give effects of between 5\% and 10\% in the peak region and of 15\% in the threshold region at the lowest considered momentum transfer (q=174MeV/c), while the dependence on other theoretical ingredients is small. At q⩾400MeV/c relativistic corrections to the charge operator and effects of frame dependence, especially for large ω, become more important. In comparison with experimental data there is generally a rather good agreement. Exceptions are the responses at excitation energies close to threshold, where there exists a large discrepancy with experiment at higher q. In the 3He case one finds a much improved agreement with experiment both in the peak region and in the low-q–low-ω region if 3N forces are included. However in comparison with the existing data for 3H the inclusion of 3N forces appears to have the opposite effect in the peak region.},

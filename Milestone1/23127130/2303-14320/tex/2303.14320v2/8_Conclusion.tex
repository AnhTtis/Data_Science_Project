\label{sec-con}
RIS technology is a key enabler for 6G networks, and control and optimization techniques are critical to exploiting the full potential of RISs. In this work, we have surveyed various approaches for optimizing RIS-aided wireless networks, including model-based, heuristic, and ML approaches. We have provided in-depth analyses of the algorithms' features, difficulties, and applications towards RIS, and we have further compared the advantages and disadvantages of nearly 20 techniques. Our analyses reveal that model-based methods exhibit satisfying performance and stability, but the algorithm design is complicated with low generalization capability. Heuristic algorithms can obtain low-complexity sub-optimal solutions, which are usually considered as baselines or supplements for other techniques. ML techniques have high generalization capability and optimality, but ML model training is computationally demanding and requires experience. Finally, the algorithm selection depends on specific optimization requirements, which should be jointly considered based on application scenarios.
It is hoped that this survey will serve as a roadmap for researchers to investigate advanced optimization techniques for RIS-aided wireless networks.

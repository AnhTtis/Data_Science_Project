%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) had achieved unprecedented novel view synthesis results, 
%
they have been struggling in dealing with large-scale cluttered scenes with sparse input views and highly view-dependent appearances.
%
Specifically, existing NeRF-based models tend to produce blurry rendering with the volumetric reconstruction often inaccurate, where a lot of reconstruction errors are observed in the form of foggy ``floaters" hovering within the entire volume of an opaque 3D scene. 
%
Such inaccuracies impede NeRF's potential for accurate 3D NeRF registration, object detection, segmentation, etc., which possibly accounts for only limited significant research effort so far to directly address these important 3D fundamental computer vision problems to date. 
%
This paper analyzes the NeRF's struggles in such settings and proposes {\bf \ournerf} for accurate 3D reconstruction and novel view rendering in complex scenes. 
%
Our key insights consist of enforcing effective appearance and geometry constraints, which are absent in the conventional NeRF reconstruction,  by 1) automatically detecting and modeling view-dependent appearances in the training views to prevent them from interfering with density estimation, which is complete with 2) a geometric correction procedure performed on each traced ray during inference.
%
\ournerf can be implemented as a plug-in that can immediately benefit existing NeRF-based methods without additional input.
%or significant computational overhead.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes {\em \ournerf} for accurate 3D reconstruction and novel view rendering in complex scenes. 
By 1)  detecting and discarding view-dependent appearances in  training, followed by 2) a geometric correction procedure performed on each traced ray during inference,
\ournerf achieves unprecedented clarity and accuracy, capable of recovering intricate object details while rejecting ``floaters" when only sparse observations are given. Codes will be released.

    "abstract": "In order to understand the anti-site disorder effect on the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect in alloys, $\\rm{Fe}_{50}Co_{50}$ alloys were studied in this work using the fully relativistic spin-polarized screened (KKR) method. The anti-site effect was modeled by interchanging Fe and Co atoms and treated by the coherent potential approximation (CPA). We find that the anti-site disorder broadens the spectral function and decreases the conductivity. Our work emphasizes that the absolute variations of resistivity under magnetic moment rotation are less affected by atomic disorders. The annealing procedure improves the AMR by reduction of the total resistivity. At the same time, we also find that the fourth-order term in the angular dependent resistivity becomes weaker when the disorder increases, resulting from increased scattering of the states around the band-crossing.",

    "abstract": "Recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments [K.P. Nuckolls et al., arXiv:2303.00024] have revealed the ubiquity of Kekulé charge-density wave order in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Most samples are moderately strained and show `incommensurate Kekulé spiral' (IKS) order involving a graphene-scale charge density distortion uniaxially modulated on the scale of the moiré superlattice, in accord with theoretical predictions. However, ultra-low strain samples instead show graphene-scale Kekulé charge order that is uniform on the moiré scale. This order, especially prominent near filling factor $ν=-2$, is unanticipated by theory which predicts a time-reversal breaking Kekulé current order at low strain. We show that including the coupling of moiré electrons to graphene-scale optical zone-corner (ZC) phonons stabilizes a uniform Kekulé charge ordered state at $|ν|=2$ with a quantized topological (spin or anomalous Hall) response. Our work clarifies how this phonon-driven selection of electronic order emerges in the strong-coupling regime of moiré graphene.",

@article{Cao2018b,
	abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity---which cannot be explained by weak electron--phonon interactions---in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1{\textdegree}---the first `magic' angle---the electronic band structure of this `twisted bilayer graphene' exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature--carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

@article{Lu2019,
	abstract = {Superconductivity can occur under conditions approaching broken-symmetry parent states1. In bilayer graphene, the twisting of one layer with respect to the other at `magic' twist angles of around 1 degree leads to the emergence of ultra-flat moir{\'e} superlattice minibands. Such bands are a rich and highly tunable source of strong-correlation physics2--5, notably superconductivity, which emerges close to interaction-induced insulating states6,7. Here we report the fabrication of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene devices with highly uniform twist angles. The reduction in twist-angle disorder reveals the presence of insulating states at all integer occupancies of the fourfold spin--valley degenerate flat conduction and valence bands---that is, at moir{\'e} band filling factors $\nu$ = 0, {\textpm}1, {\textpm}2, {\textpm}3. At $\nu$ ≈ −2, superconductivity is observed below critical temperatures of up to 3 kelvin. We also observe three new superconducting domes at much lower temperatures, close to the $\nu$ = 0 and $\nu$ = {\textpm}1 insulating states. Notably, at $\nu$ = {\textpm} 1 we find states with non-zero Chern numbers. For $\nu$ = −1 the insulating state exhibits a sharp hysteretic resistance enhancement when a perpendicular magnetic field greater than 3.6 tesla is applied, which is consistent with a field-driven phase transition. Our study shows that broken-symmetry states, interaction-driven insulators, orbital magnets, states with non-zero Chern numbers and superconducting domes occur frequently across a wide range of moir{\'e} flat band fillings, including close to charge neutrality. This study provides a more detailed view of the phenomenology of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, adding to our evolving understanding of its emergent properties.},

@article{Serlin900,
	abstract = {Quantum anomalous Hall effect{\textemdash}the appearance of quantized Hall conductance at zero magnetic field{\textemdash}has been observed in thin films of the topological insulator Bi2Se3 doped with magnetic atoms. The doping, however, introduces inhomogeneity, reducing the temperature at which the effect occurs. Two groups have now observed quantum anomalous Hall effect in intrinsically magnetic materials (see the Perspective by Wakefield and Checkelsky). Serlin et al. did so in twisted bilayer graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride, where the effect enabled the switching of magnetization with tiny currents. In a complementary work, Deng et al. observed quantum anomalous Hall effect in the antiferromagnetic layered topological insulator MnBi2Te4.Science, this issue p. 900, p. 895; see also p. 848The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect combines topology and magnetism to produce precisely quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. We report the observation of a QAH effect in twisted bilayer graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride. The effect is driven by intrinsic strong interactions, which polarize the electrons into a single spin- and valley-resolved moir{\'e} miniband with Chern number C = 1. In contrast to magnetically doped systems, the measured transport energy gap is larger than the Curie temperature for magnetic ordering, and quantization to within 0.1\% of the von Klitzing constant persists to temperatures of several kelvin at zero magnetic field. Electrical currents as small as 1 nanoampere controllably switch the magnetic order between states of opposite polarization, forming an electrically rewritable magnetic memory.},

	abstract = {Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) displays a variety of symmetry-broken phases, correlated Chern insulators, orbital magnetism and superconductivity1--8. In particular, the anomalous Hall effect has been observed when the bands are filled with an odd number of electrons per moir{\'e}unit cell5,6,9, indicating the emergence of a zero-field orbital magnetic state with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry10--12. Here we present measurements of two tBLG devices with twist angles slightly away from the magic angle and report the observation of the anomalous Hall effect at half filling of both the electron and hole moir{\'e}bands. We suggest that two factors---the increased band dispersion away from the magic angle, and substrate potentials from the encapsulating boron nitride---probably play critical roles in stabilizing a valley-polarized ground state at half filling. Our findings further expand the rich correlated phase diagram of tBLG, and indicate the need to develop a more complete understanding of its manifold of closely competing symmetry-breaking orders.},

@article{Twistons,
	abstract = {Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) has recently emerged as a platform to engineer strongly correlated flat bands. We reveal the normal-state structural and electronic properties of TTG using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy at twist angles for which superconductivity has been observed. Real trilayer samples undergo a strong reconstruction of the moir{\'e} lattice, which locks layers into near--magic-angle, mirror symmetric domains comparable in size with the superconducting coherence length. This relaxation introduces an array of localized twist-angle faults, termed twistons and moir{\'e} solitons, whose electronic structure deviates strongly from the background regions, leading to a doping-dependent, spatially granular electronic landscape. The Fermi-level density of states is maximally uniform at dopings for which superconductivity has been observed in transport measurements. Stacking and twisting graphene layers with respect to each other can lead to exotic transport effects. Recently, superconductivity was observed in graphene trilayers in which the top and bottom layers are twisted with respect to the middle layer by the same, ``magic'' angle. Turkel et al. used scanning tunneling microscopy to take a closer look into the stacking structure. They found that a small misalignment between the top and bottom layers caused the lattice to rearrange itself into a pattern of triangular domains. The domains had a magic-angle twisted trilayer structure and were separated by a network of line and point defects. ---JS Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals lattice reconstruction in a moire material.},

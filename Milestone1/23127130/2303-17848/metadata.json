    "abstract": "The finite Hilbert transform $T$ is a classical (singular) kernel operator which is continuous in every rearrangement invariant space $X$ over $(-1,1)$ having non-trivial Boyd indices. For $X=L^p$, $1<p<\\infty$, this operator has been intensively investigated since the 1940's (also under the guise of the ``airfoil equation''). Recently, the extension and inversion of $T\\colon X\\to X$ for more general $X$ has been studied in G. P. Curbera, S. Okada, W. J. Ricker, Inversion and extension of the finite Hilbert transform on $(-1,1)$, Ann. Mat. Pura Appl. 198 (2019), 1835-1860, where it is shown that there exists a larger space $[T,X]$, optimal in a well defined sense, which contains $X$ continuously and such that $T$ can be extended to a continuous linear operator $T\\colon[T,X]\\to X$. The purpose of this paper is to continue this investigation of $T$ via a consideration of the $X$-valued vector measure $m_X\\colon A\\mapsto T(χ_A)$ induced by $T$ and its associated integration operator $f\\mapsto \\int_{-1}^1f\\,dm_X$. In particular, we present integral representations of $T\\colon X\\to X$ based on the $L^1$-space of $m_X$ and other related spaces of integrable functions.",

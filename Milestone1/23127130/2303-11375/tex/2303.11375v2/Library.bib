We now have strong theoretical evidence that quantum computers, if built, might be used as a dramatically powerful computational tool. This review is about to tell the story of theoretical quantum computation. I left out the developing topic of experimental realizations of the model, and neglected other closely related topics which are quantum information and quantum communication. As a result of narrowing the scope of this paper, I hope it has gained the benefit of being an almost self contained introduction to the exciting field of quantum computation. The review begins with background on theoretical computer science, Turing machines and Boolean circuits. In light of these models, I define quantum computers, and discuss the issue of universal quantum gates. Quantum algorithms, including Shor's factorization algorithm and Grover's algorithm for searching databases, are explained. I will devote much attention to understanding what the origins of the quantum computational power are, and what the limits of this power are. Finally, I describe the recent theoretical results which show that quantum computers maintain their complexity power even in the presence of noise, inaccuracies and finite precision. I tried to put all results in their context, asking what the implications to other issues in computer science and physics are. In the end of this review I make these connections explicit, discussing the possible implications of quantum computation on fundamental physical questions, such as the transition from quantum to classical physics.},

Employing a one-dimensional model system, we show that for strong nonadiabatic couplings the nuclear C-TDPESs exhibit steps that bridge piecewise adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer potential-energy surfaces. The nature of these steps is identified as an effect of electron-nuclear correlation. Furthermore, a direct comparison with similar discontinuities recently reported in the context of the exact factorization framework allows us to draw conclusions about the universality of these discontinuities, viz., they are inherent to all nonadiabatic nuclear dynamics approaches based on (exact) time-dependent potential-energy surfaces.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear differential equations exhibit rich phenomena in many fields but are notoriously challenging to solve. Recently, Liu et al. [1] demonstrated the first efficient quantum algorithm for dissipative quadratic differential equations under the condition \$R {$<$} 1\$, where \$R\$ measures the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the \$\textbackslash ell\_2\$ norm. Here we develop an efficient quantum algorithm based on [1] for reaction-diffusion equations, a class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). To achieve this, we improve upon the Carleman linearization approach introduced in [1] to obtain a faster convergence rate under the condition \$R\_D {$<$} 1\$, where \$R\_D\$ measures the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the \$\textbackslash ell\_\{\textbackslash infty\}\$ norm. Since \$R\_D\$ is independent of the number of spatial grid points \$n\$ while \$R\$ increases with \$n\$, the criterion \$R\_D{$<$}1\$ is significantly milder than \$R{$<$}1\$ for high-dimensional systems and can stay convergent under grid refinement for approximating PDEs. As applications of our quantum algorithm we consider the Fisher-KPP and Allen-Cahn equations, which have interpretations in classical physics. In particular, we show how to estimate the mean square kinetic energy in the solution by postprocessing the quantum state that encodes it to extract derivative information.},

Here, we show that it is possible to load an N-dimensional vector with exponential time advantage using a quantum circuit with polylogarithmic depth and entangled information in ancillary qubits. Results show that we can efficiently load data in quantum devices using a divide-and-conquer strategy to exchange computational time for space. We demonstrate a proof of concept on a real quantum device and present two applications for quantum machine learning.

We provide an overview of fundamental concepts in quantum chemistry, including the basic principles of the Hartree-Fock method. A flagship feature in PennyLane is the differentiable Hartree-Fock solver, allowing users to compute exact gradients of molecular Hamiltonians with respect to nuclear coordinates and basis set parameters. PennyLane provides specialized operations for quantum chemistry, including excitation gates as Givens rotations and templates for quantum chemistry circuits. Moreover, built-in simulators exploit sparse matrix techniques for representing molecular Hamiltonians that lead to fast simulation for quantum chemistry applications. In combination with PennyLane's existing methods for constructing, optimizing, and executing circuits, these methods allow users to implement a wide range of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry. We discuss how PennyLane can be used to implement variational algorithms for calculating ground-state energies, excited-state energies, and energy derivatives, all of which can be differentiated with respect to both circuit and Hamiltonian parameters. We conclude with an example workflow describing how to jointly optimize circuit parameters, nuclear coordinates, and basis set parameters for quantum chemistry algorithms. By combining insights from quantum computing, computational chemistry, and machine learning, PennyLane is the first library for differentiable quantum computational chemistry.},

Here, we perform a series of quantum simulations of chemistry the largest of which involved a dozen qubits, 78 two-qubit gates, and 114 one-qubit gates. We model the binding energy of \$\{\textbackslash rm H\}\_6\$, \$\{\textbackslash rm H\}\_8\$, \$\{\textbackslash rm H\}\_\{10\}\$ and \$\{\textbackslash rm H\}\_\{12\}\$ chains as well as the isomerization of diazene. We also demonstrate error-mitigation strategies based on \$N\$-representability which dramatically improve the effective fidelity of our experiments. Our parameterized ansatz circuits realize the Givens rotation approach to non-interacting fermion evolution, which we variationally optimize to prepare the Hartree-Fock wavefunction. This ubiquitous algorithmic primitive corresponds to a rotation of the orbital basis and is required by many proposals for correlated simulations of molecules and Hubbard models. Because non-interacting fermion evolutions are classically tractable to simulate, yet still generate highly entangled states over the computational basis, we use these experiments to benchmark the performance of our hardware while establishing a foundation for scaling up more complex correlated quantum simulations of chemistry.},

  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2\textendash 7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times\textemdash our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8\textendash 14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

However, the non-negligible gate error present on NISQ devices impedes the implementation of many purely quantum algorithms, necessitating the use of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. One such hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is based upon quantum computed Hamiltonian moments , with respect to quantum state . In this tutorial review, we will give a brief review of these quantum algorithms with focuses on the typical ways of computing Hamiltonian moments using quantum hardware and improving the accuracy of the estimated state energies based on the quantum computed moments. We also present a computation of the Hamiltonian moments of a four-site Heisenberg model and compute the energy and magnetization of the model utilizing the imaginary time evolution on current IBM-Q hardware. Finally, we discuss some possible developments and applications of Hamiltonian moment methods.},

The filtered Lanczos procedure uses a carefully chosen polynomial spectral transformation to accelerate convergence of the Lanczos method when computing eigenvalues within a desired interval. This method has proven particularly effective for eigenvalue problems that arise in electronic structure calculations and density functional theory. We compare our implementation against an equivalent CPU implementation and show that using the GPU can reduce the computation time by more than a factor of 10.

Solution method: To compute all the eigenvalues within a given interval a polynomial spectral transformation is constructed that maps the desired eigenvalues of the original matrix to the exterior of the spectrum of the transformed matrix. The Lanczos method is then used to compute the desired eigenvectors of the transformed matrix, which are then used to recover the desired eigenvalues of the original matrix. The bulk of the operations are executed in parallel using a graphics processing unit (GPU). Runtime: Variable, depending on the number of eigenvalues sought and the size and sparsity of the matrix.

A low-depth implementation of quantum circuits within the hybrid variational paradigm is designed, and their computational costs are analyzed. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by incorporating it in some key quantum chemistry applications of energy derivatives, such as to perform minimum energy configuration search and estimate molecular response properties of H2 molecule, and also to find the transition state of H2 + H {$\leftrightarrow$} H +~H2 reaction.

  abstract = {Quantum simulation of the electronic structure problem is one of the most researched applications of quantum computing. The majority of quantum algorithms for this problem encode the wavefunction using N Gaussian orbitals, leading to Hamiltonians with O(N4) second-quantized terms. We avoid this overhead and extend methods to condensed phase materials by utilizing a dual form of the plane wave basis which diagonalizes the potential operator, leading to a Hamiltonian representation with O(N2) second-quantized terms. Using this representation, we can implement single Trotter steps of the Hamiltonians with linear gate depth on a planar lattice. Properties of the basis allow us to deploy Trotter- and Taylor-series-based simulations with respective circuit depths of O(N7/2) and \texttildelow O(N8/3) for fixed charge densities. Variational algorithms also require significantly fewer measurements in this basis, ameliorating a primary challenge of that approach. While our approach applies to the simulation of arbitrary electronic structure problems, the basis sets explored in this work will be most practical for treating periodic systems, such as crystalline materials, in the near term. We conclude with a proposal to simulate the uniform electron gas (jellium) using a low-depth variational ansatz realizable on near-term quantum devices. From these results, we identify simulations of low-density jellium as a promising first setting to explore quantum supremacy in electronic structure.},

Accordingly, quantum computers have been predominantly regarded as competitors to only the most accurate and costly classical methods for treating electron correlation. However, here we tighten bounds showing that certain first-quantized quantum algorithms enable exact time evolution of electronic systems with exponentially less space and polynomially fewer operations in basis set size than conventional real-time time-dependent Hartree\textendash Fock and density functional theory. Although the need to sample observables in the quantum algorithm reduces the speedup, we show that one can estimate all elements of the k-particle reduced density matrix with a number of samples scaling only polylogarithmically in basis set size. We also introduce a more efficient quantum algorithm for first-quantized mean-field state preparation that is likely cheaper than the cost of time evolution. We conclude that quantum speedup is most pronounced for finite-temperature simulations and suggest several practically important electron dynamics problems with potential quantum advantage.},

  abstract = {A long-held view of the origin of covalent binding is based on the notion that electrostatic forces determine the stability of a system of charged particles and that, therefore, potential energy changes drive the stabilization of molecules. A key argument advanced for this conjecture is the rigorous validity of the virial theorem. Rigorous in-depth analyses have however shown that the energy lowering of covalent bonding is due to the wave mechanical drive of electrons to lower their kinetic energy through expansion. Since the virial theorem applies only to systems with Coulombic interaction potentials, its relevance as a foundation of the electrostatic view is tested here by calculations on analogues of the molecules H2+ and H2, where all 1/r interaction potentials are replaced by Gaussian-type potentials that yield one-electron ``atoms'' with realistic stability ranges. The virial theorem does not hold in these systems, but covalent bonds are found to form nonetheless, and the wave mechanical bonding analysis yields analogous results as in the case of the Coulombic potentials. Notably, the key driving feature is again the electron delocalization that lowers the interatomic kinetic energy component. A detailed discussion of the role of the virial theorem in the context of covalent binding is given.},

  abstract = {Dynamical electronic- and vibrational-structure theories have received a growing interest in the past few years due to their ability to simulate spectra recorded with ultrafast experimental techniques. The exact time evolution of a molecular system can, in principle, be obtained from the time-dependent version of full configuration interaction. Such an approach is, however, limited to few-atom systems due to the exponential increase of its cost with the system dimension. In the present work, we overcome this unfavorable scaling by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) which parametrizes the time-dependent wave function as a matrix product state. The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation is then integrated with a sweep-based algorithm, as in standard time-independent DMRG. Unlike other TD-DMRG approaches, the one presented here leads to a set of coupled equations that can be integrated exactly. The resulting theory enables us to study real- and imaginary-time evolutions of Hamiltonians comprising more than 20 degrees of freedom that are challenging for current state-of-the-art quantum dynamics algorithms. We apply our algorithm to the simulation of quantum dynamics of models of increasing complexity, ranging from simple excitonic Hamiltonians to more complex ab initio vibronic ones.},

The number of possible molecules that can be obtained from a set of atomic species grow exponentially with the size of the system, limiting the efficiency of classical sampling algorithms. On the other hand, quantum computers can provide an efficient solution to the sampling of the chemical compound space for the optimization of a given molecular property. In this work we propose a quantum algorithm for addressing the material design problem with a favourable scaling. The core of this approach is the representation of the space of candidate structures as a linear superposition of all possible atomic compositions. The corresponding `alchemical' Hamiltonian drives then the optimization in both the atomic and electronic spaces leading to the selection of the best fitting molecule, which optimizes a given property of the system, e.g., the interaction with an external potential in drug design. The quantum advantage resides in the efficient calculation of the electronic structure properties together with the sampling of the exponentially large chemical compound space. We demonstrate both in simulations and in IBM Quantum hardware the efficiency of our scheme and highlight the results in a few test cases. These preliminary results can serve as a basis for the development of further material design quantum algorithms for near-term quantum computers.},

The state of the molecular system at study is parametrized in a way to efficiently explore the sector of the molecular Fock space that contains the desired solution. To this end, we explore several trial wavefunctions to identify the most efficient parameterization of the molecular ground state. Taking advantage of known post-Hartree Fock quantum chemistry approaches and heuristic Hilbert space search quantum algorithms, we propose a new family of quantum circuits based on exchange-type gates that enable accurate calculations while keeping the gate count (i.e., the circuit depth) low. The particle-hole implementation of the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) method within the Variational Quantum Eigensolver approach gives rise to an efficient quantum algorithm, named q-UCC , with important advantages compared to the straightforward 'translation' of the classical Coupled Cluster counterpart.

  abstract = {This PhD thesis combines two of the most exciting research areas of the last decades: quantum computing and machine learning. We introduce dissipative quantum neural networks (DQNNs), which are designed for fully quantum learning tasks, are capable of universal quantum computation and have low memory requirements while training. These networks are optimised with training data pairs in form of input and desired output states and therefore can be used for characterising unknown or untrusted quantum devices. We not only demonstrate the generalisation behaviour of DQNNs using classical simulations, but also implement them successfully on actual quantum computers. To understand the ultimate limits for such quantum machine learning methods, we discuss the quantum no free lunch theorem, which describes a bound on the probability that a quantum device, which can be modelled as a unitary process and is optimised with quantum examples, gives an incorrect output for a random input. Moreover we expand the area of applications of DQNNs in two directions. In the first case, we include additional information beyond just the training data pairs: since quantum devices are always structured, the resulting data is always structured as well. We modify the DQNN's training algorithm such that knowledge about the graph-structure of the training data pairs is included in the training process and show that this can lead to better generalisation behaviour. Both the original DQNN and the DQNN including graph structure are trained with data pairs in order to characterise an underlying relation. However, in the second extension of the algorithm we aim to learn characteristics of a set of quantum states in order to extend it to quantum states which have similar properties. Therefore we build a generative adversarial model where two DQNNs, called the generator and discriminator, are trained in a competitive way.},

When iterated, this procedure enables simulations to arbitrary times with an error controlled by the compression fidelity and a fixed Trotter step size. We show how to measure the required cost function, the overlap between the time-evolved and variational states, on present-day hardware, making use of several error mitigation methods. In addition to carrying out simulations on real hardware, we investigate the performance and scaling behavior of the algorithm with noiseless and noisy classical simulations.

Popular versions are variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) and quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOAs) that solve ground state problems from quantum chemistry and binary optimization problems, respectively. They are based on the idea to use a classical computer to train a parameterized quantum circuit. We show that the corresponding classical optimization problems are NP-hard. Moreover, the hardness is robust in the sense that for every polynomial time algorithm, there exists instances for which the relative error resulting from the classical optimization problem can be arbitrarily large, unless P = NP. Even for classically tractable systems, composed of only logarithmically many qubits or free fermions, we show that the optimization is NP-hard. This elucidates that the classical optimization is intrinsically hard and does not merely inherit the hardness from the ground state problem. Our analysis shows that the training landscape can have many far from optimal persistent local minima. This means gradient and higher order decent algorithms will generally converge to far from optimal solutions.},

  abstract = {Tensors with finite correlation afford very compact tensor network representations. A novel tensor network-based decomposition of real-time path integral simulations involving Feynman-Vernon influence functional is introduced. In this tensor network path integral (TNPI) technique, the finite temporarily non-local interactions introduced by the influence functional can be captured very efficiently using matrix product state representation for the path amplitude (PA) tensor. We illustrate this particular TNPI method through various realistic examples, including a charge transfer reaction and an exciton transfer in a dimer. We also show how it is readily applied to systems with greater than two states by simulating a 7-site model of FMO and a molecular wire model. The augmented propagator (AP) TNPI utilizes the symmetries of the problem, leading to accelerated convergence and dramatic reductions of computational effort. We also introduce an approximate method that speeds up propagation beyond the non-local memory length. Furthermore, the structure imposed by the tensor network representation of the PA tensor naturally suggests other factorizations that make simulations for extended systems more efficient. These factorizations would be the subject of future explorations. The flexibility of the AP-TNPI framework makes it a promising new addition to the family of path integral methods for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.},

  abstract = {We discuss encodings of fermionic many-body systems by qubits in the presence of symmetries. Such encodings eliminate redundant degrees of freedom in a way that preserves a simple structure of the system Hamiltonian enabling quantum simulations with fewer qubits. First we consider \$U(1)\$ symmetry describing the particle number conservation. Using a previously known encoding based on the first quantization method a system of \$M\$ fermi modes with \$N\$ particles can be simulated on a quantum computer with \$Q=N\textbackslash log\{(M)\}\$ qubits. We propose a new version of this encoding tailored to variational quantum algorithms. Also we show how to improve sparsity of the simulator Hamiltonian using orthogonal arrays. Next we consider encodings based on the second quantization method. It is shown that encodings with a given filling fraction \$\textbackslash nu=N/M\$ and a qubit-per-mode ratio \$\textbackslash eta=Q/M{$<$}1\$ can be constructed from efficiently decodable classical LDPC codes with the relative distance \$2\textbackslash nu\$ and the encoding rate \$1-\textbackslash eta\$. A family of codes based on high-girth bipartite graphs is discussed. Graph-based encodings eliminate roughly \$M/N\$ qubits. Finally we consider discrete symmetries, and show how to eliminate qubits using previously known encodings, illustrating the technique for simple molecular-type Hamiltonians.},

Our method works at a finite temperature, beyond linear response and weak system-reservoir coupling, and allows for nonquadratic interactions in the working medium. The method uses mesoscopic reservoirs, continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium, in order to represent continuum baths and a novel tensor-network algorithm to simulate the steady-state thermodynamics. Using the example of a quantum-dot heat engine, we demonstrate that our technique replicates the well-known Landauer-B\"uttiker theory for efficiency and power. We then go beyond the quadratic limit to demonstrate the capability of our method by simulating a three-site machine with nonquadratic interactions. Remarkably, we find that such interactions lead to power enhancement, without being detrimental to the efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of our method to tackle complex many-body systems by extracting the superdiffusive exponent for high-temperature transport in the isotropic Heisenberg model. Finally, we discuss transport in the gapless phase of the anisotropic Heisenberg model at a finite temperature and its connection to charge conjugation parity, going beyond the predictions of single-site boundary driving configurations.},

  abstract = {The detection of individual molecules allows to unwrap the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble and reveal the spatial disorder and temporal dynamics of single entities. During 20 years of increasing sophistication this approach has provided valuable insights into biomolecular interactions, cellular processes, polymer dynamics, etc. Unfortunately the detection of fluorescence, i.e. incoherent spontaneous emission, has essentially kept the time resolution of the single molecule approach out of the range of ultrafast coherent processes. In parallel coherent control of quantum interferences has developed as a powerful method to study and actively steer ultrafast molecular interactions and energy conversion processes. However the degree of coherent control that can be reached in ensembles is restricted, due to the intrinsic inhomogeneity of the synchronized subset. Clearly the only way to overcome spatio-temporal disorder and achieve key control is by addressing individual units: coherent control of single molecules. Here we report the observation and manipulation of vibrational wave-packet interference in individual molecules at ambient conditions. We show that adapting the time and phase distribution of the optical excitation field to the dynamics of each molecule results in a superior degree of control compared to the ensemble approach. Phase reversal does invert the molecular response, confirming the control of quantum coherence. Time-phase maps show a rich diversity in excited state dynamics between different, yet chemically identical, molecules. The presented approach is promising for single-unit coherent control in multichromophoric systems. Especially the role of coherence in the energy transfer of single antenna complexes under physiological conditions is subject of great attention. Now the role of energy disorder and variation in coupling strength can be explored, beyond the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble.},

  abstract = {When error correction becomes possible it will be necessary to dedicate a large number of physical qubits to each logical qubit. Error correction allows for deeper circuits to be run, but each additional physical qubit can potentially contribute an exponential increase in computational space, so there is a trade-off between using qubits for error correction or using them as noisy qubits. In this work we look at the effects of using noisy qubits in conjunction with noiseless qubits (an idealized model for error-corrected qubits), which we call the "clean and dirty" setup. We employ analytical models and numerical simulations to characterize this setup. Numerically we show the appearance of Noise-Induced Barren Plateaus (NIBPs), i.e., an exponential concentration of observables caused by noise, in an Ising model Hamiltonian variational ansatz circuit. We observe this even if only a single qubit is noisy and given a deep enough circuit, suggesting that NIBPs cannot be fully overcome simply by error-correcting a subset of the qubits. On the positive side, we find that for every noiseless qubit in the circuit, there is an exponential suppression in concentration of gradient observables, showing the benefit of partial error correction. Finally, our analytical models corroborate these findings by showing that observables concentrate with a scaling in the exponent related to the ratio of dirty-to-total qubits.},

  abstract = {Error mitigation is an essential component of achieving practical quantum advantage in the near term, and a number of different approaches have been proposed. In this work, we recognize that many state-of-the-art error mitigation methods share a common feature: they are data-driven, employing classical data obtained from runs of different quantum circuits. For example, Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) uses variable noise data and Clifford-data regression (CDR) uses data from near-Clifford circuits. We show that Virtual Distillation (VD) can be viewed in a similar manner by considering classical data produced from different numbers of state preparations. Observing this fact allows us to unify these three methods under a general data-driven error mitigation framework that we call UNIfied Technique for Error mitigation with Data (UNITED). In certain situations, we find that our UNITED method can outperform the individual methods (i.e., the whole is better than the individual parts). Specifically, we employ a realistic noise model obtained from a trapped ion quantum computer to benchmark UNITED, as well as state-of-the-art methods, for problems with various numbers of qubits, circuit depths and total numbers of shots. We find that different techniques are optimal for different shot budgets. Namely, ZNE is the best performer for small shot budgets (\$ 10\^5\$), while Clifford-based approaches are optimal for larger shot budgets (\$ 10\^6 - 10\^8\$), and for our largest considered shot budget (\$10\^\{10\}\$), UNITED gives the most accurate correction. Hence, our work represents a benchmarking of current error mitigation methods, and provides a guide for the regimes when certain methods are most useful.},

However, the circuit depth becomes one of the bottlenecks of its application to large molecules of more than 20 qubits. In this work, we propose a new strategy by employing the point group symmetry to reduce the number of operators in constructing ansatz to achieve a more compact quantum circuit. We illustrate this methodology with a series of molecules ranging from LiH (12 qubits) to C2H4 (28 qubits). A significant reduction of up to 82\% of the operator numbers is reached on C2H4, which enables the largest molecule ever simulated by VQE to the best of our knowledge.},

Quantum error correction (QEC), however, may have a wider range of uses, including information transmission, quantum simulation/computation, and fault-tolerance. These invite us to rethink QEC, in particular, about the role that quantum physics plays in terms of encoding and decoding. The fact that many quantum algorithms, especially near-term hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, only use limited types of local measurements on quantum states, leads to various new techniques called Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM). This work addresses the differences and connections between QEC and QEM, by examining different application scenarios. We demonstrate that QEM protocols, which aim to recover the output density matrix, from a quantum circuit do not always preserve important quantum resources, such as entanglement with another party. We then discuss the implications of noise invertibility on the task of error mitigation, and give an explicit construction called quasi-inverse for non-invertible noise, which is trace-preserving while the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse may not be. We also study the consequences of erroneously characterizing the noise channels, and derive conditions when a QEM protocol can reduce the noise.},

Recent work has established guarantees for in-distribution generalization of quantum neural networks (QNNs), where training and testing data are assumed to be drawn from the same data distribution. However, there are currently no results on out-of-distribution generalization in QML, where we require a trained model to perform well even on data drawn from a distribution different from the training distribution. In this work, we prove out-of-distribution generalization for the task of learning an unknown unitary using a QNN and for a broad class of training and testing distributions. In particular, we show that one can learn the action of a unitary on entangled states using only product state training data. We numerically illustrate this by showing that the evolution of a Heisenberg spin chain can be learned using only product training states. Since product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the prospects of learning quantum dynamics using near term quantum computers and quantum experiments, and further opens up new methods for both the classical and quantum compilation of quantum circuits.},

While VQAs may enable practical applications of noisy quantum computers, they are nevertheless heuristic methods with unproven scaling. Here, we rigorously prove two results, assuming \$V(\textbackslash vec\{\textbackslash theta\})\$ is an alternating layered ansatz composed of blocks forming local 2-designs. Our first result states that defining \$C\$ in terms of global observables leads to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e., barren plateaus) even when \$V(\textbackslash vec\{\textbackslash theta\})\$ is shallow. Hence, several VQAs in the literature must revise their proposed costs. On the other hand, our second result states that defining \$C\$ with local observables leads to at worst a polynomially vanishing gradient, so long as the depth of \$V(\textbackslash vec\{\textbackslash theta\})\$ is \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash log n)\$. Our results establish a connection between locality and trainability. We illustrate these ideas with large-scale simulations, up to 100 qubits, of a quantum autoencoder implementation.},

  abstract = {Applications such as simulating large quantum systems or solving large-scale linear algebra problems are immensely challenging for classical computers due their extremely high computational cost. Quantum computers promise to unlock these applications, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will likely not be available for several years. Currently available quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited qubit numbers and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), which employ a classical optimizer to train a parametrized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisioned for quantum computers, and they appear to the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain including the trainability, accuracy, and efficiency of VQAs. In this review article we present an overview of the field of VQAs. Furthermore, we discuss strategies to overcome their challenges as well as the exciting prospects for using them as a means to obtain quantum advantage.},

  abstract = {To understand the chemical properties of molecules, it is often important to study derivatives of energies with respect to nuclear coordinates or external fields. Quantum algorithms for computing energy derivatives have been proposed, but only limited work has been done to address the specific challenges that arise in this context, where calculations are more complicated and involve more stringent requirements on accuracy compared to single-point energy calculations. In this work, we introduce a technique to improve the performance of variational quantum circuits calculating energy derivatives. The method, which we refer to as tailgating, is an adaptive procedure that selects gates based on their gradient with respect to the expectation value of Hamiltonian derivatives. These gates are then added at the end of a quantum circuit originally designed to calculate ground- or excited-state energies. A distinguishing feature of this approach is that the appended gates do not need to be optimized: their parameters can be set to zero and varied only for the purpose of computing energy derivatives, via calculating derivatives with respect to circuit parameters. We support the validity of this method by establishing sufficient conditions for a circuit to compute accurate energy gradients. This is achieved through a connection between energy derivatives and eigenstates of Taylor approximations of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the advantages of the tailgating approach by performing simulations calculating the vibrational modes of beryllium hydride and water: quantities that depend on second-order energy derivatives.},

Treten in den Problemen sehr hohe Dimensionen auf, sind Standardtechniken nicht mehr durchf\"uhrbar. Die Anzahl und Gr\"o\ss e der Objekte, welche gespeichert und verarbeitet werden m\"ussen, \"ubersteigt bei Weitem die Kapazit\"aten eines Standard-Computers. Dieser Umstand wird h\"aufig als der Fluch der Dimension bezeichnet. Deshalb m\"ussen andere Ans\"atze zur Behandlung solcher Probleme herangezogen werden, wie zum Beispiel dynamische Approximationen von niedrigem Rang.    Dynamische Approximationen von niedrigem Rang beruhen auf der Projektion der Zeitableitung einer zeitabh\"angigen L\"osung eines gegebenen Problems auf den Tangentialraum eines L\"osungsraums, welcher eine niedrigere Komplexit\"at aufweist. Die Mannigfaltigkeit der Matrizen von festem Rang r sind ein Beispiel f\"ur einen solchen L\"osungsraums. Auf dieser speziellen Mannigfaltigkeit wurde mit Hilfe einer Zerlegung der Projektion (=Projektions-Splitting) ein Integrator vorgestellt. Dieser erh\"alt die spezielle Struktur der Objekte bei, was ein effizientes Speichern erm\"oglicht. Weiter weist der Integrator Robustheit bez\"uglich kleiner Singul\"arwerte auf, was essentiell ist um eine ausreichende Genauigkeit der Approximation zu gew\"ahrleisten.     F\"ur hoch-dimensionale Probleme existieren diverse Mannigfaltigkeiten von niedrigem Rang, auf welchen analog Integratoren vorgestellt wurden, die ebenfalls auf einer Zerlegung der Projektion beruhen. Die Literatur ist reich an Arbeiten zu dynamischen Approximationen von niedrigem Rang f\"ur hoch-dimensionale, niedrig-rangige und schleifen-freie Darstellungen, wie zum Beispiel Tucker-Tensoren oder Tensoren in hierarchischer Tucker Darstellung.     Wir pr\"asentieren hier die Erweiterung des Projektions-Splitting Integrators f\"ur Matrizen auf die Klasse der Tensor-Netzwerke, welche nach Konstruktion alle oben genannten Darstellungen verallgemeinert.     Weiter wird eine nicht-triviale Modifikation des Projektions-Splitting Integrators vorgestellt, welche die (Schief-)Symmetrie von Matrizen und Tucker-Tensoren erh\"alt.     Diese Modifikation wurde auf Matrizen von niedrigem Rang und Tensoren in Tucker Darstellung verallgemeinert.    Aufgrund der ungew\"ohnlichen Herleitung und Konstruktion des neuen Integrators, bezeichnen wir diesen als unkonventionellen Integrator. Im Unterschied zum Projektions-Splitting Integrator f\"ur Matrizen und Tucker-Tensoren, erm\"oglicht der unkonventionelle Integrator paralleles Rechnen. Er erh\"alt die urspr\"unglichen vorteilhaften Eigenschaften des Projektions-Splitting Integrators f\"ur Matrizen und Tucker-Tensoren und bietet mehr Stabilit\"at bei stark dissipativen Problemen.},

Furthermore, the integrator is extended to the approximation of time-dependent tensors by Tucker tensors of fixed multilinear rank. The proposed low-rank integrator is different from the known projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, but it retains the important robustness to small singular values that has so far been known only for the projector-splitting integrator. The new integrator also offers some potential advantages over the projector-splitting integrator: It avoids the backward time integration substep of the projector-splitting integrator, which is a potentially unstable substep for dissipative problems. It offers more parallelism, and it preserves symmetry or anti-symmetry of the matrix or tensor when the differential equation does. Numerical experiments illustrate the behaviour of the proposed integrator.},

Using graphical tools based on the \textbackslash zx calculus, we explicitly construct small distance 3 and 5 codes with high code rates using this framework. We also show how this framework can be used to represent CSS codes and conversely how to compute stabilisers for a CPC code. We give a construction turns (almost) any pair of classical [n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code, and give a straightforward technique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and demonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes.

One motivation for the development of such X-ray sources was the proposal to obtain structures of macromolecules, macromolecular complexes, and virus particles, without the need for crystallization, through diffraction measurements of single noncrystalline objects. Initial explorations of this idea and of outrunning radiation damage with femtosecond pulses led to the development of serial crystallography and the ability to obtain high-resolution structures of small crystals without the need for cryogenic cooling. This technique allows the understanding of conformational dynamics and enzymatics and the resolution of intermediate states in reactions over timescales of 100 fs to minutes. The promise of more photons per atom recorded in a diffraction pattern than electrons per atom contributing to an electron micrograph may enable diffraction measurements of single molecules, although challenges remain.},

An unexpected behavior was seen in the physical qubit labelled as qubit 3 of IBM Q 5 Tenerife, which can be a consequence of detector crosstalk or qubit operations influencing each other and requires further investigation. This peculiar behavior is consistent with characterization from the more sophisticated approach of the gate set tomography. We also discuss how the characterized detectors' POVM, despite deviation from the ideal projectors, can be used to estimate the ideal detection distribution.},

  abstract = {Realizing the potential of quantum computing requires sufficiently low logical error rates1. Many applications call for error rates as low as 10-15 (refs. 2\textendash 9), but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near 10-3 (refs. 10\textendash 14). Quantum error correction15\textendash 17 promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected. Errors on the encoded logical qubit state can be exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold and stable over the course of a computation. Here we implement one-dimensional repetition codes embedded in a two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits that demonstrate exponential suppression of bit-flip or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round more than 100-fold when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analysing error correlations with high precision, allowing us to characterize error locality while performing quantum error correction. Finally, we perform error detection~with a small logical qubit using the 2D surface code~on the same device18,19 and show that the results from both one- and two-dimensional codes agree with numerical simulations that use a simple depolarizing error model. These experimental demonstrations provide a foundation for building a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer with superconducting qubits.},

Finding an efficient enumeration scheme allows one to increase the locality of the target qubit Hamiltonian without expending any additional resources. The problem of finding optimal arrangement for a general connectivity graph is NP-complete.

The trace of each operator is estimated using a standard algorithm in the one-clean-qubit model. For large values of Z, our method may run faster than exact classical methods, whose complexities are polynomial in M. We also prove that a version of the partition function estimation problem within additive error is complete for the so-called DQC1 complexity class, suggesting that our method provides a superpolynomial speedup for certain parameter values. To attain a desired relative precision, we develop a classical procedure based on a sequence of approximations within predetermined additive errors that may be of independent interest.},

  abstract = {Noise mitigation and reduction will be crucial for obtaining useful answers from near-term quantum computers. In this work, we present a general framework based on machine learning for reducing the impact of quantum hardware noise on quantum circuits. Our method, called noise-aware circuit learning (NACL), applies to circuits designed to compute a unitary transformation, prepare a set of quantum states, or estimate an observable of a many-qubit state. Given a task and a device model that captures information about the noise and connectivity of qubits in a device, NACL outputs an optimized circuit to accomplish this task in the presence of noise. It does so by minimizing a task-specific cost function over circuit depths and circuit structures. To demonstrate NACL, we construct circuits resilient to a fine-grained noise model derived from gate set tomography on a superconducting-circuit quantum device, for applications including quantum state overlap, quantum Fourier transform, and W-state preparation.},

However, the circuit depth of standard Trotterization methods can rapidly exceed the coherence time of noisy quantum computers. This has led to recent proposals for variational approaches to dynamical simulation. In this work, we aim to make variational dynamical simulation even more practical and near-term. We propose a new algorithm called Variational Hamiltonian Diagonalization (VHD), which approximately transforms a given Hamiltonian into a diagonal form that can be easily exponentiated. VHD allows for fast forwarding, i.e., simulation beyond the coherence time of the quantum computer with a fixed-depth quantum circuit. It also removes Trotterization error and allows simulation of the entire Hilbert space. We prove an operational meaning for the VHD cost function in terms of the average simulation fidelity. Moreover, we prove that the VHD cost function does not exhibit a shallow-depth barren plateau, i.e., its gradient does not vanish exponentially. Our proof relies on locality of the Hamiltonian, and hence we connect locality to trainability. Our numerical simulations verify that VHD can be used for fast-forwarding dynamics.},

  abstract = {Quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) algorithms provide a low-cost alternative to the conventional quantum phase estimation algorithm for estimating the ground and excited-state energies of a quantum many-body system. While QKSD algorithms have typically relied on using the Hadamard test for estimating Krylov subspace matrix elements of the form, \$\textbackslash langle \textbackslash phi\_i|e\^\{-i\textbackslash hat\{H\}\textbackslash tau\}|\textbackslash phi\_j \textbackslash rangle\$, the associated quantum circuits require an ancilla qubit with controlled multi-qubit gates that can be quite costly for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we show that a wide class of Hamiltonians relevant to condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry contain symmetries that can be exploited to avoid the use of the Hadamard test. We propose a multi-fidelity estimation protocol that can be used to compute such quantities showing that our approach, when combined with efficient single-fidelity estimation protocols, provides a substantial reduction in circuit depth. In addition, we develop a unified theory of quantum Krylov subspace algorithms and present three new quantum-classical algorithms for the ground and excited-state energy estimation problem, where each new algorithm provides various advantages and disadvantages in terms of total number of calls to the quantum computer, gate depth, classical complexity, and stability of the generalized eigenvalue problem within the Krylov subspace.},

However, this approximation breaks down when the dynamics of molecules in excited electronic states are considered. Describing dynamics when the Born\textendash Oppenheimer approximation breaks down requires a quantum mechanical description of the nuclei. Chemical reaction dynamics on excited electronic states is critical for many applications in renewable energy, chemical synthesis, and bioimaging. Furthermore, it is necessary in order to connect with many ultrafast pump\textendash probe spectroscopic experiments. In this review, we provide an overview of methods that can describe nonadiabatic dynamics, with emphasis on those that are able to simultaneously address the quantum mechanics of both electrons and nuclei. Such ab initio quantum molecular dynamics methods solve the electronic Schr\"odinger equation alongside the nuclear dynamics and thereby avoid the need for precalculation of potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements. Two main families of methods are commonly employed to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics in molecules: full quantum dynamics, such as the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method, and classical trajectory-based approaches, such as trajectory surface hopping. In this review, we describe a third class of methods that is intermediate between the two: Gaussian basis set expansions built around trajectories.}

Recent breakthroughs have introduced methods capable of exponentially suppressing errors by preparing multiple noisy copies of a state and virtually distilling a more purified version. Here we present an alternative method, the Resource-Efficient Quantum Error Suppression Technique (REQUEST), that adapts this breakthrough to much fewer qubits by making use of active qubit resets, a feature now available on commercial platforms. Our approach exploits a space/time trade-off to achieve a similar error reduction using only \$2N+1\$ qubits as opposed to \$MN+1\$ qubits, for \$M\$ copies of an \$N\$ qubit state. Additionally, we propose a method using near-Clifford circuits to find the optimal number of these copies in the presence of realistic noise, which limits this error suppression. We perform a numerical comparison between the original method and our qubit-efficient version with a realistic trapped-ion noise model. We find that REQUEST can reproduce the exponential suppression of errors of the virtual distillation approach, while out-performing virtual distillation when fewer than \$3N+1\$ qubits are available. Finally, we examine the scaling of the number of shots \$N\_S\$ required for REQUEST to achieve useful corrections. We find that \$N\_S\$ remains reasonable well into the quantum advantage regime where \$N\$ is hundreds of qubits.},

Among the different statements of this fundamental property of the full quantum mechanical nature of physical reality, the uncertainty relation for energy and time has a special place. Its interpretation and its consequences have inspired continued research efforts for almost a century. In its modern formulation, the uncertainty relation is understood as setting a fundamental bound on how fast any quantum system can evolve. In this topical review we describe important milestones, such as the Mandelstam\textendash Tamm and the Margolus\textendash Levitin bounds on the quantum speed limit, and summarise recent applications in a variety of current research fields\textemdash including quantum information theory, quantum computing, and quantum thermodynamics amongst several others. To bring order and to provide an access point into the many different notions and concepts, we have grouped the various approaches into the minimal time approach and the geometric approach, where the former relies on quantum control theory, and the latter arises from measuring the distinguishability of quantum states. Due to the volume of the literature, this topical review can only present a snapshot of the current state-of-the-art and can never be fully comprehensive. Therefore, we highlight but a few works hoping that our selection can serve as a representative starting point for the interested reader.},

  abstract = {This work studies pulse based variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which are designed to determine the ground state of a quantum mechanical system by combining classical and quantum hardware. In contrast to more standard gate based methods, pulse based methods aim to directly optimize the laser pulses interacting with the qubits, instead of using some parametrized gate based circuit. Using the mathematical formalism of optimal control, these laser pulses are optimized. This method has been used in quantum computing to optimize pulses for quantum gate implementations, but has only recently been proposed for full optimization in VQAs. Pulse based methods have several advantages over gate based methods such as faster state preparation, simpler implementation and more freedom in moving through the state space. Based on these ideas, we present the development of a novel adjoint based variational method. This method can be tailored towards and applied in neutral atom quantum computers. This method of pulse based variational quantum optimal control is able to approximate molecular ground states of simple molecules up to chemical accuracy and is able to compete with the gate based variational quantum eigensolver in terms of total number of quantum evaluations. The total evolution time \$T\$ and the form of the control Hamiltonian \$H\_c\$ are important factors in the convergence behavior to the ground state energy, both having influence on the quantum speed limit and the controllability of the system.},

  abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church\textendash Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer' are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.}

  abstract = {Metal halide perovskite (MHP) thin films are currently undergoing an intense research thrust due to the excellent performance of MHP based photovoltaic (PV) devices, which have the potential to revolutionize the worlds energy production via a unique combination of low-cost fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the vast majority of research is currently aimed at incremental improvements in device PCE, resulting in a body of work without the foundational understanding of the charge-carrier dynamics of the system upon photoexcitation. This thesis begins with the development of a phase-modulated multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (PM-MDCS) experiment. PM-MDCS is an ultrafast multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) technique that can identify photophysical processes unavailable to one-dimensional spectroscopies. The thesis then goes on to describe the development of a novel data acquisition scheme and data processing technique, diagonal slice four-wave mixing (DS-FWM). Next, a description of calibrating the absolute phase in PM-MDCS experiments is presented. Finally, the thesis discusses the application of steady-state photoluminescence (PL), MDCS, and DS-FWM to study the charge-carrier dynamics in MHP thin films at 5K. These studies provide crucial information to building a fundamental understanding of the photophysical processes in MHP films under illumination, providing direction for targeted research toward improved MHP PV performance.},

Recent solid-state approaches have used quantum dots, donor-atom nuclear spins or electron spins; in these architectures, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable exchange interaction between spins (a Heisenberg interaction), whereas the one-qubit gates require control over a local magnetic field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit operations are significantly slower, requiring substantially greater materials and device complexity - potentially contributing to a detrimental increase in the decoherence rate. Here we introduced an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction alone suffices to implement exactly any quantum computer circuit. This capability comes at a price of a factor of three in additional qubits, and about a factor of ten in additional two-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the complexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards solid-state implementations of quantum computation.},

Recently, the differences between semiclassical and quantum-electrodynamical (QED) theory of light-matter interaction for scattering of ultrashort x-ray pulses from the electronic wavepacket were formally demonstrated and visually illustrated by scattering patterns calculated for an electronic wavepacket in atomic hydrogen [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., \{\textbackslash bf 109\}, 11636 (2012)]. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of time-resolved x-ray scattering from a sample containing a mixture of non-stationary and stationary electrons within both the theories. In a many-electron system, the role of scattering interference between a non-stationary and several stationary electrons to the total scattering signal is investigated. In general, QED and semiclassical theory provide different results for the contribution from the scattering interference, which depends on the energy resolution of the detector and the x-ray pulse duration. The present findings are demonstrated by means of a numerical example of x-ray TRI for an electronic wavepacket in helium. It is shown that the time-dependent scattering interference vanishes within semiclassical theory and the corresponding patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the time-independent interference, whereas the time-dependent scattering interference contribution does not vanish in the QED theory and the patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the non-stationary electron scattering.},

Here, we reexamine two recently formulated concepts that a coherent vibronic coupling between molecular states would either extend the electronic coherence lifetime or enhance the amplitude of the anticorrelated vibrational mode at longer times. For this, we study a vibronically coupled dimer and calculate the nonlinear two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectra that directly reveal electronic coherence. The time scale of electronic coherence is initially extracted by measuring the antidiagonal bandwidth of the central peak in the 2D spectrum at zero waiting time. Based on the residual analysis, we identify small-amplitude long-lived oscillations in the cross-peaks, which, however, are solely due to groundstate vibrational coherence, regardless of having resonant or off-resonant conditions. Our studies neither show an enhancement of the electronic quantum coherence nor an enhancement of the anticorrelated vibrational mode by the vibronic coupling under ambient conditions.},

Namely, a simple ansatze is insufficient to capture the optimal solution, while an intricate ansatze leads to the hardness of the trainability. Despite its fundamental importance, an effective strategy of measuring the expressivity of VQAs remains largely unknown. Here, we exploit an advanced tool in statistical learning theory, i.e., covering number, to study the expressivity of VQAs. In particular, we first exhibit how the expressivity of VQAs with an arbitrary ansatze is upper bounded by the number of quantum gates and the measurement observable. We next explore the expressivity of VQAs on near-term quantum chips, where the system noise is considered. We observe an exponential decay of the expressivity with increasing circuit depth. We also utilize the achieved expressivity to analyze the generalization of QNNs and the accuracy of VQE. We numerically verify our theory employing VQAs with different levels of expressivity. Our work opens the avenue for quantitative understanding of the expressivity of VQAs.},

  abstract = {Understanding decoherence and dissipation in quantum systems is essential for exploiting quantum effects in emerging technological applications. A proper understanding requires accurate modelling of the system-environment interaction which can only be achieved through treating the system and environment on an equal footing. Simulating the entire system+environment wave-function is a challenging task due to the exponential scaling which is characteristic of quantum mechanics. By using many-body methods based on the powerful concept of a tensor network, one can, nonetheless, obtain numerically exact quantum dynamics for systems with hundreds of degrees of freedom. In addition, a recent innovation has shown that this many-body approach can be extended to finite temperatures without a significant increase in computational cost or algorithmic complexity. This has allowed us to directly compare quantum dynamical simulations with experimental results. Specifically, simulations of the linear vibronic coupling Hamiltonian, parameterised using abinitio electronic structure methods, were used to compute the absorption spectrum of the dye Methylene blue in water. This study has elucidated certain unexplained features of the absorption and shown the how non-adiabatic dynamics resulting from a conical intersection can lead to intensity borrowing between bright and dark excited states. Several methodological advances are also made, including an improvement to the underlying time evolution method TDVP which brings with it an order of magnitude speed-up compared to existing methods.},

These extra degrees of freedom enable the detection and correction of errors, but also increase the operational complexity of the encoded logical qubit. Fault-tolerant circuits contain the spread of errors while operating the logical qubit, and are essential for realizing error suppression in practice. While fault-tolerant design works in principle, it has not previously been demonstrated in an error-corrected physical system with native noise characteristics. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate fault-tolerant preparation, measurement, rotation, and stabilizer measurement of a Bacon-Shor logical qubit using 13 trapped ion qubits. When we compare these fault-tolerant protocols to non-fault tolerant protocols, we see significant reductions in the error rates of the logical primitives in the presence of noise. The result of fault-tolerant design is an average state preparation and measurement error of 0.6\% and a Clifford gate error of 0.3\% after error correction. Additionally, we prepare magic states with fidelities exceeding the distillation threshold, demonstrating all of the key single-qubit ingredients required for universal fault-tolerant operation. These results demonstrate that fault-tolerant circuits enable highly accurate logical primitives in current quantum systems. With improved two-qubit gates and the use of intermediate measurements, a stabilized logical qubit can be achieved.},

Such simulations on quantum computers, promising a significantly greater accuracy and speed, are projected to exert a great impact on the way we can probe reality, predict the outcomes of chemical experiments, and even drive design of drugs, catalysts, and materials. In this work we review the current status of quantum hardware and algorithm theory and examine whether such popular claims about quantum advantage are really going to be transformative. We go over subtle complications of quantum chemical research that tend to be overlooked in discussions involving quantum computers. We estimate quantum computer resources that will be required for performing calculations on quantum computers with chemical accuracy for several types of molecules. In particular, we directly compare the resources and timings associated with classical and quantum computers for the molecules H\$\_2\$ for increasing basis set sizes, and Cr\$\_2\$ for a variety of complete active spaces (CAS) within the scope of the CASCI and CASSCF methods. The results obtained for the chromium dimer enable us to estimate the size of the active space at which computations of non-dynamic correlation on a quantum computer should take less time than analogous computations on a classical computer. Using this result, we speculate on the types of chemical applications for which the use of quantum computers would be both beneficial and relevant to industrial applications in the short term.},

Specifically, subsets of excitation operators are pre-screened from the unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) operator pool according to its contribution to the total energy. The procedure is then iteratively repeated until the convergence of the final energy to within the chemical accuracy. For demonstration, this method has been sucessfully applied to systems of molecules and periodic hydrogen chain. Particularly, a reduction up to 14 times in the number of operators is observed while retaining the accuracy of the origin UCCSD operator pools. This method can be widely extended to other variational ansatz other than UCC.},

The electronic energies are calculated on a quantum computer using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method. Algorithms for computation of analytical gradients entirely on a quantum computer require quantum fault-tolerant hardware, which is beyond NISQ-era. Therefore, we compute the energy gradients numerically using finite differences, the Hellmann\textendash Feynman theorem, and a correlated sampling technique. This method only requires additional classical calculations of electron integrals for each degree of freedom without any additional computations on a quantum computer beyond the initial VQE run. As a proof of concept, AIMD simulations are demonstrated for the H2 molecule on IBM quantum devices. In addition, we demonstrate the validity of the method for larger molecules using full configuration interaction wave functions.

  abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a method that uses a hybrid quantum-classical computational approach to find eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. VQE has been proposed as an alternative to fully quantum algorithms such as quantum phase estimation (QPE) because fully quantum algorithms require quantum hardware that will not be accessible in the near future. VQE has been successfully applied to solve the electronic Schr\"odinger equation for a variety of small molecules. However, the scalability of this method is limited by two factors: the complexity of the quantum circuits and the complexity of the classical optimization problem. Both of these factors are affected by the choice of the variational ansatz used to represent the trial wave function. Hence, the construction of an efficient ansatz is an active area of research. Put another way, modern quantum computers are not capable of executing deep quantum circuits produced by using currently available ansatzes for problems that map onto more than several qubits. In this review, we present recent developments in the field of designing efficient ansatzes that fall into two categories\textemdash chemistry\textendash inspired and hardware\textendash efficient\textemdash that produce quantum circuits that are easier to run on modern hardware. We discuss the shortfalls of ansatzes originally formulated for VQE simulations, how they are addressed in more sophisticated methods, and the potential ways for further improvements.},

For a GaAs quantum ring model in resonance with a photon mode we highlight how the ground-state electronic potential-energy surface changes the usual harmonic potential of the free photon mode to a dressed mode with a double-well structure. This change is accompanied by a splitting of the electronic ground-state density. For a model where the photon mode is in resonance with a vibrational transition, we observe in the excited-state electronic potential-energy surface a splitting from a single minimum to a double minimum. Furthermore, for a time-dependent setup, we show how the dynamics in correlated light-matter systems can be understood in terms of population transfer between potential energy surfaces. This work at the interface of quantum chemistry and quantum optics paves the way for the full ab initio description of matter-photon systems.},

We outline how logical qubits are physically moved on the array, how qubit braid transformations are constructed, and how a braid between two logical qubits is equivalent to a controlled-not.

Morimae, K. Fujii, and J. F. Fitzsimons, Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 130502 (2014)]. It was open whether we can keep the no-go result while reducing the number of output qubits from three to one. Here, we solve the open problem affirmatively. We also show that the third-level collapse of the polynomial-time hierarchy can be strengthened to the second-level one. The strengthening of the collapse level from the third to the second also holds for other subuniversal models such as the instantaneous quantum polynomial model [M. Bremner, R. Jozsa, and D. J.

No initializations of qubits are allowed during the computation, nor intermediate measurements. The main results of this paper are unexpectedly strong error-reducible properties of such quantum computations. It is proved that any problem solvable by a polynomial-time quantum computation with one-sided bounded error that uses logarithmically many clean qubits can also be solvable with exponentially small one-sided error using just two clean qubits, and with polynomially small one-sided error using just one clean qubit. It is further proved in the case of two-sided bounded error that any problem solvable by such a computation with a constant gap between completeness and soundness using logarithmically many clean qubits can also be solvable with exponentially small two-sided error using just two clean qubits. If only one clean qubit is available, the problem is again still solvable with exponentially small error in one of the completeness and soundness and polynomially small error in the other. As an immediate consequence of the above result for the two-sided-error case, it follows that the TRACE ESTIMATION problem defined with fixed constant threshold parameters is complete for the classes of problems solvable by polynomial-time quantum computations with completeness 2/3 and soundness 1/3 using logarithmically many clean qubits and just one clean qubit. The techniques used for proving the error-reduction results may be of independent interest in themselves, and one of the technical tools can also be used to show the hardness of weak classical simulations of one-clean-qubit computations (i.e., DQC1 computations).},

Many systems of interest contain electronic transitions spanning the ultraviolet to the near infrared and beyond. Most 2DES measurements to date have explored a relatively small frequency range.

We believe that the next significant step will be to demonstrate a quantum memory, in which a system of interacting qubits stores an encoded logical qubit state longer than the incorporated parts. Here, we describe the important route towards a logical memory with superconducting qubits, employing a rotated version of the surface code. The current status of technology with regards to interconnected superconducting-qubit networks will be described and near-term areas of focus to improve devices will be identified. Overall, the progress in this exciting field has been astounding, but we are at an important turning point, where it will be critical to incorporate engineering solutions with quantum architectural considerations, laying the foundation towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computers in the near future.},

The efficiency of this algorithm depends crucially on the ability to prepare multi-qubit trial states on the quantum processor that either include, or at least closely approximate, the actual energy eigenstates of the problem being simulated while avoiding states that have little overlap with them. Symmetries play a central role in determining the best trial states. Here, we present efficient state preparation circuits that respect particle number, total spin, spin projection, and time-reversal symmetries. These circuits contain the minimal number of variational parameters needed to fully span the appropriate symmetry subspace dictated by the chemistry problem while avoiding all irrelevant sectors of Hilbert space. We show how to construct these circuits for arbitrary numbers of orbitals, electrons, and spin quantum numbers, and we provide explicit decompositions and gate counts in terms of standard gate sets in each case.

  abstract = {An important task in quantum physics is the estimation of local quantities for ground states of local Hamiltonians. Recently, [Ambainis, CCC 2014] defined the complexity class P\^QMA[log], and motivated its study by showing that the physical task of estimating the expectation value of a local observable against the ground state of a local Hamiltonian is P\^QMA[log]-complete. In this paper, we continue the study of P\^QMA[log], obtaining the following lower and upper bounds. Lower bounds (hardness results): (1) The P\^QMA[log]-completeness result of [Ambainis, CCC 2014] requires O(log n)-local observables and Hamiltonians. We show that simulating even a single qubit measurement on ground states of 5-local Hamiltonians is P\^QMA[log]-complete, resolving an open question of Ambainis. (2) We formalize the complexity theoretic study of estimating two-point correlation functions against ground states, and show that this task is similarly P\^QMA[log]-complete. (3) We identify a flaw in [Ambainis, CCC 2014] regarding a P\^UQMA[log]-hardness proof for estimating spectral gaps of local Hamiltonians. By introducing a "query validation" technique, we build on [Ambainis, CCC 2014] to obtain P\^UQMA[log]-hardness for estimating spectral gaps under polynomial-time Turing reductions. Upper bounds (containment in complexity classes): P\^QMA[log] is thought of as "slightly harder" than QMA. We justify this formally by exploiting the hierarchical voting technique of [Beigel, Hemachandra, Wechsung, SCT 1989] to show P\^QMA[log] is in PP. This improves the containment QMA is in PP [Kitaev, Watrous, STOC 2000]. This work contributes a rigorous treatment of the subtlety involved in studying oracle classes in which the oracle solves a promise problem. This is particularly relevant for quantum complexity theory, where most natural classes such as BQP and QMA are defined as promise classes.},

The point of view taken is that no reduction in one physical system can have an instantaneous effect on another, isolated system. It is shown that the philosophical contradictions exposed by the Einstein-Podolsky Rosen can be directly transferred to an interpretation of physical events. Attention is directed toward the possibility of a photon, propagating in one direction with either circular or plane polarization, entering a nonselective laser tube. The photon originally emerged from a quantum decay process which yielded two photons traveling in opposite directions. The photon in the laser gain tube precipitates a beam which is polarized as the initiating photon. A first observer can then determine the polarization observed by a second observer (with the laser) before the signal arrives. It is concluded that the FLASH argument of Herbert (1982) therefore assumes a violation of quantum mechanical laws in order to use quantum mechanics to prove that faster-than-light communication is possible.},

The battery is initially prepared as the ground state of a one-dimensional transverse \$XY\$ model with open boundary condition and is charged (discharged) via interactions with local bosonic reservoirs. We show that in the transient regime, quantum battery (QB) can store energy faster and has a higher maximum extractable work, quantified via ergotropy, when it is affected by local phase-flip or bit-flip Markovian noise compared to the case when there is no noise in the system. In both the charging and discharging processes, we report the enhancement in work-output as well as in ergotropy when all the spins are affected by non-Markovian Ohmic bath both in the transient and the steady-state regimes, thereby showing a counter-intuitive advantage of decoherence in QB. Both in Markovian and non-Markovian cases, we identify the system parameters and the corresponding noise models which lead to maximum enhancement of work-output and ergotropy. Moreover, we show that the benefit due to noise persists even with the initial state being prepared at a moderate temperature.},

In contrast, neural networks have evolved to tolerate imprecision and inhomogeneity. Here, using a reservoir computing architecture we show how a random network of quantum nodes can be used as a robust hardware for quantum computing. Our network architecture induces quantum operations by optimising only a single layer of quantum nodes, a key advantage over the traditional neural networks where many layers of neurons have to be optimised. We demonstrate how a single network can induce different quantum gates, including a universal gate set. Moreover, in the few-qubit regime, we show that sequences of multiple quantum gates in quantum circuits can be compressed with a single operation, potentially reducing the operation time and complexity. As the key resource is a random network of nodes, with no specific topology or structure, this architecture is a hardware friendly alternative paradigm for quantum computation.},

To validate this strategy, we performed the excited state calculations at the FC and CI geometries of ethylene and phenol blue at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level of theory, and found that the energy errors were at most 2\,kcal\,mol-1 even on the ibm\_kawasaki device.},

The latter is a mathematical idealization of natural patterns with optimal packing, where the area represented by each point is almost identical. Using the Fibonacci lattice would reduce the root mean squared error by at least 40\%. If, as is commonly the case, around a million lattice points are used, the maximum error would be an order of magnitude smaller.},

The potentials appearing in these equations have provided insight into non-adiabatic processes, and new practical non-adiabatic dynamics methods have been formulated starting from these equations. Here, we provide a first demonstration of a self-consistent solution of the exact equations, with a preliminary analysis of their stability and convergence properties. The equations have an unprecedented mathematical form, involving a Hamiltonian outside the class of Hermitian Hamiltonians usually encountered in time-propagation, and so the usual numerical methods for time-dependent Schr\"odinger fail when applied in a straightforward way to the EF equations. We find an approach that enables stable propagation long enough to witness non-adiabatic behavior in a model system before non-trivial instabilities take over. Implications for the development and analysis of EF-based methods are discussed.},

  abstract = {Quantum states are very delicate, so it is likely some sort of quantum error correction will be necessary to build reliable quantum computers. The theory of quantum error-correcting codes has some close ties to and some striking differences from the theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many quantum codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with four elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves correctly in the presence of errors, we also need a theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation, instructing us how to perform quantum gates on qubits which are encoded in a quantum error-correcting code. The threshold theorem states that it is possible to create a quantum computer to perform an arbitrary quantum computation provided the error rate per physical gate or time step is below some constant threshold value.},

In QM/MM methods, the region of the system in which the chemical process takes place is treated at an appropriate level of quantum chemistry theory, while the remainder is described by a molecular mechanics force field. Within this approach, chemical reactivity can be studied in large systems, such as enzymes. In the first part of this contribution, the basic methodology is briefly reviewed. The two most common approaches for partitioning the two subsystems are presented, followed by a discussion on the different ways of treating interactions between the subsystems. Special attention is given on how to deal with situations in which the boundary between the QM and MM subsystems runs through one or more chemical bonds. The second part of this contribution discusses what properties of larger system can be obtained within the QM/MM framework and how. Finally, as an example of a QM/MM application in practice, the third part presents an overview of recent QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations on photobiological systems. In addition to providing quantities that are experimentally accessible, such as structural intermediates, fluorescence lifetimes, quantum yields and spectra, the QM/MM simulations also provide information that is much more difficult to measure experimentally, such as reaction mechanisms and the influence of individual amino acid residues.},

  abstract = {Watching as helium goes topsy-turvy Theorists have long pondered the underpinnings of the Fano resonance, a spectral feature that resembles adjacent rightside-up and upside-down peaks. An especially well-studied instance of this feature appears in the electronic spectrum of helium as a transient state undergoes delayed ionization. Two studies have now traced the dynamics of this state in real time. Gruson et al. used photoelectron spectroscopy to extract the amplitude and phase of the electron wave packet after inducing its interference with reference wave packets tuned into resonance at variable delays. Kaldun et al. used extreme ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy to probe the transient state while variably forcing ionization with a strong near-infrared field. Science, this issue pp. 734 and 738 The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of wave packets. However, the rapidity of electron dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron wave packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photoelectron wave packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by electron correlation, as well as coherent control over structured electron wave packets. Ultrafast spectroscopy traces the dynamics of a transient excited state in helium underlying appearance of a Fano resonance.

Interestingly, the popular split-step Fourier method (SSFM) leads to a computation graph that is reminiscent of a deep neural network. This observation allows one to leverage tools from machine learning to reduce complexity. In particular, the main disadvantage of the SSFM is that its complexity using M steps is at least M times larger than a linear equalizer. This is because the linear SSFM operator is a dense matrix. In previous work, truncation methods such as frequency sampling, wavelets, or least-squares have been used to obtain ``cheaper'' operators that can be implemented using filters. However, a large number of filter taps are typically required to limit truncation errors. For example, Ip and Kahn showed that for a 10 Gbaud signal and 2000 km optical link, a truncated SSFM with 25 steps would require 70-tap filters in each step and 100 times more operations than linear equalization. We find that, by jointly optimizing all filters with deep learning, the complexity can be reduced significantly for similar accuracy. Using optimized 5-tap and 3-tap filters in an alternating fashion, one requires only around 2-6 times the complexity of linear equalization, depending on the implementation.},

Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

  abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {Obtaining the exciton dynamics of large photosynthetic complexes by using mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) is computationally demanding. We propose a machine learning technique, multi-layer perceptrons, as a tool to reduce the time required to compute excited state energies. With this approach we predict time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) excited state energies of bacteriochlorophylls in the Fenna\textendash Matthews\textendash Olson (FMO) complex. Additionally we compute spectral densities and exciton populations from the predictions. Different methods to determine multi-layer perceptron training sets are introduced, leading to several initial data selections. In addition, we compute spectral densities and exciton populations. Once multi-layer perceptrons are trained, predicting excited state energies was found to be significantly faster than the corresponding QM/MM calculations. We showed that multi-layer perceptrons can successfully reproduce the energies of QM/MM calculations to a high degree of accuracy with prediction errors contained within 0.01 eV (0.5\%). Spectral densities and exciton dynamics are also in agreement with the TDDFT results. The acceleration and accurate prediction of dynamics strongly encourage the combination of machine learning techniques with ab initio methods.},

First, we define a class of "local" classical optimization algorithms and show that a single step version of these algorithms can achieve the same performance as the single step QAOA on MAX-3-LIN-2. Second, we show that this class of classical algorithms generalizes a class previously considered in the literature, and also that a single step of the classical algorithm will outperform the single-step QAOA on all triangle-free MAX-CUT instances. In fact, for all but \$4\$ choices of degree, existing single-step classical algorithms already outperform the QAOA on these graphs, while for the remaining \$4\$ choices we show that the generalization here outperforms it. Finally, we consider the QAOA and provide strong evidence that, for any fixed number of steps, its performance on MAX-3-LIN-2 on bounded degree graphs cannot achieve the same scaling as can be done by a class of "global" classical algorithms. These results suggest that such local classical algorithms are likely to be at least as promising as the QAOA for approximate optimization.},

Being a quantum mechanical problem, in many cases we do not know an efficient classical witness to the optimum, or even to an approximation of the optimum. One prominent exception is when the optimum is described by a so-called "Gaussian state", also called a free fermion state. In this work we are interested in the complexity of this optimization problem when no good Gaussian state exists. Our primary testbed is the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model of random degree-\$q\$ polynomials, a model of great current interest in condensed matter physics and string theory, and one which has remarkable properties from a computational complexity standpoint. Among other results, we give an efficient classical certification algorithm for upper-bounding the largest eigenvalue in the \$q=4\$ SYK model, and an efficient quantum certification algorithm for lower-bounding this largest eigenvalue; both algorithms achieve constant-factor approximations with high probability.},

The simplest method for this task, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, yields strings of Pauli operators acting on an extensive number of qubits. This overhead can be a hindrance to implementation of qubit-based quantum simulators, especially in the analog context. Here we thus review and analyze alternative fermion-to-qubit mappings, including the two approaches by Bravyi and Kitaev and the auxiliary fermion transformation. The Bravyi-Kitaev transform is reformulated in terms of a classical data structure and generalized to achieve a further locality improvement for local fermionic models on a rectangular lattice. We conclude that the most compact encoding of the fermionic operators can be done using ancilla qubits with the auxiliary fermion scheme. Without introducing ancillas, a variant of the Bravyi-Kitaev transform provides the most compact fermion-to-qubit mapping for Hubbard-like models.},

The model was trained on a data set relevant to photosynthetic excitation energy transfer and can be deployed to study long-lasting quantum coherence phenomena observed in light-harvesting complexes.

  abstract = {Quantum simulation is one of the key applications of quantum computing, which can accelerate research and development in chemistry, material science, etc. Here, we propose an efficient method to simulate the time evolution driven by a static Hamiltonian, named subspace variational quantum simulator (SVQS). SVQS employs the subspace-search variational eigensolver (SSVQE) to find a low-energy subspace and further extends it to simulate dynamics within the low-energy subspace. More precisely, using a parameterized quantum circuit, the low-energy subspace of interest is encoded into a computational subspace spanned by a set of computational basis, where information processing can be easily done. After the information processing, the computational subspace is decoded to the original low-energy subspace. This allows us to simulate the dynamics of low-energy subspace with lower overhead compared to existing schemes. While the dimension is restricted for feasibility on near-term quantum devices, the idea is similar to quantum phase estimation and its applications such as quantum linear system solver and quantum metropolis sampling. Because of this simplicity, we can successfully demonstrate the proposed method on the actual quantum device using Regetti Quantum Cloud Service. Furthermore, we propose a variational initial state preparation for SVQS, where the initial states are searched from the simulatable eigensubspace. Finally, we demonstrate SVQS on Rigetti Quantum Cloud Service.},

For realistic vibrational potentials, the local mode representation should give a more compact representation of the potentials, i.e., lowering the dimensionality of the entanglements, than the normal coordinates, and the MPS-MCTDH formulation should work more efficiently and maintain the accuracy with a small bond dimension of the MPS ansatz. In fact, it was confirmed that the use of the local coordinates made the interaction matrices diagonal dominant and the number of terms in the n-body expansion of the potentials was significantly reduced. The method was applied to the IR spectrum of the CH2O molecule, the zero-point energies, and the vibrational energy redistribution dynamics of polyenes C2nH2n+2. The results showed that the efficiency of the MPS-MCTDH method is significantly accelerated by the use of local coordinates even if the long-range interactions are included in the potential.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers are growing in size, and design decisions are being made now that attempt to squeeze more computation out of these machines. In this spirit, we design a method to boost the computational power of near-term quantum computers by adapting protocols used in quantum error correction to implement "Approximate Quantum Error Correction (AQEC)." By approximating fully-fledged error correction mechanisms, we can increase the compute volume (qubits x gates, or "Simple Quantum Volume (SQV)") of near-term machines. The crux of our design is a fast hardware decoder that can approximately decode detected error syndromes rapidly. Specifically, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept that approximate error decoding can be accomplished online in near-term quantum systems by designing and implementing a novel algorithm in superconducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) logic technology. This avoids a critical decoding backlog, hidden in all offline decoding schemes, that leads to idle time exponential in the number of T gates in a program [58]. Our design utilizes one SFQ processing module per physical quantum bit. Employing state-of-the-art SFQ synthesis tools, we show that the circuit area, power, and latency are within the constraints of typical, contemporary quantum system designs. Under a pure dephasing error model, the proposed accelerator and AQEC solution is able to expand SQV by factors between 3,402 and 11,163 on expected near-term machines. The decoder achieves a 5\% accuracy threshold as well as pseudo-thresholds of approximately 5\%, 4.75\%, 4.5\%, and 3.5\% physical error rates for code distances 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively.

  abstract = {Understanding what can be learned from experiments is central to scientific progress. In this work, we use a learning-theoretic perspective to study the task of learning physical operations in a quantum machine when all operations (state preparation, dynamics, and measurement) are a priori unknown. We prove that, without any prior knowledge, if one can explore the full quantum state space by composing the operations, then every operation can be learned. When one cannot explore the full state space but all operations are approximately known and noise in Clifford gates is gate-independent, we find an efficient algorithm for learning all operations up to a single unlearnable parameter characterizing the fidelity of the initial state. For learning a noise channel on Clifford gates to a fixed accuracy, our algorithm uses quadratically fewer experiments than previously known protocols. Under more general conditions, the true description of the noise can be unlearnable; for example, we prove that no benchmarking protocol can learn gate-dependent Pauli noise on Clifford+T gates even under perfect state preparation and measurement. Despite not being able to learn the noise, we show that a noisy quantum computer that performs entangled measurements on multiple copies of an unknown state can yield a large advantage in learning properties of the state compared to a noiseless device that measures individual copies and then processes the measurement data using a classical computer. Concretely, we prove that noisy quantum computers with two-qubit gate error rate \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ can achieve a learning task using \$N\$ copies of the state, while \$N\^\{\textbackslash Omega(1/\textbackslash epsilon)\}\$ copies are required classically.},

The number of measurements is independent of the system size and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians. The numerical results highlight the advantages of classical shadows relative to previously known methods.},

We present an extension to the variational quantum eigensolver that approximates the ground state of a system by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem in a subspace spanned by a collection of parametrized quantum states. This allows for the systematic improvement of a logical wavefunction ansatz without a significant increase in circuit complexity. To minimize the circuit complexity of this approach, we propose a strategy for efficiently measuring the Hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements between states parametrized by circuits that commute with the total particle number operator. This strategy doubles the size of the state preparation circuits but not their depth, while adding a small number of additional two-qubit gates relative to standard variational quantum eigensolver. We also propose a classical Monte Carlo scheme to estimate the uncertainty in the ground state energy caused by a finite number of measurements of the matrix elements. We explain how this Monte Carlo procedure can be extended to adaptively schedule the required measurements, reducing the number of circuit executions necessary for a given accuracy. We apply these ideas to two model strongly correlated systems, a square configuration of H4 and the {$\pi$}-system of hexatriene (C6H8).},

The solutions to these problems will offer accurate predictions of chemical reactivity and kinetics, and other properties of quantum systems1\textendash 4. Fermionic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods5,6, which use a statistical sampling of the ground state, are among the most powerful approaches to these problems. Controlling the fermionic sign problem with constraints ensures the efficiency of QMC at the expense of potentially significant biases owing to the limited flexibility of classical computation. Here we propose an approach that combines constrained QMC with quantum computation to reduce such biases. We implement our scheme experimentally using up to 16 qubits to unbias constrained QMC calculations performed on chemical systems with as many as 120 orbitals. These experiments represent the largest chemistry simulations performed with the help of quantum computers, while achieving accuracy that is competitive with state-of-the-art classical methods without burdensome error mitigation. Compared with the popular variational quantum eigensolver7,8, our hybrid quantum-classical computational model offers an alternative path towards achieving a practical quantum advantage for the electronic structure problem without demanding exceedingly accurate preparation and measurement of the ground-state wavefunction.},

Quantum error correction is expected to eventually enable fault-tolerant quantum computation at large scales, but until then it will be necessary to use alternative strategies to mitigate the impact of errors. We propose a near-term friendly strategy to mitigate errors by entangling and measuring \$M\$ copies of a noisy state \$\textbackslash rho\$. This enables us to estimate expectation values with respect to a state with dramatically reduced error, \$\textbackslash rho\^M/ \textbackslash mathrm\{Tr\}(\textbackslash rho\^M)\$, without explicitly preparing it, hence the name "virtual distillation". As \$M\$ increases, this state approaches the closest pure state to \$\textbackslash rho\$, exponentially quickly. We analyze the effectiveness of virtual distillation and find that it is governed in many regimes by the behavior of this pure state (corresponding to the dominant eigenvector of \$\textbackslash rho\$). We numerically demonstrate that virtual distillation is capable of suppressing errors by multiple orders of magnitude and explain how this effect is enhanced as the system size grows. Finally, we show that this technique can improve the convergence of randomized quantum algorithms, even in the absence of device noise.},

In dual-state purification, we effectively generate a purified state with increased fidelity using the erroneous state and its dual state, respectively, prepared with the noisy quantum circuit and the dual map of its inverse circuit. Combined with tomography purification, we can make sure that the final estimate of an observable is obtained from a pure state. The numerical result suggests that our protocol reduces the error by a rescaling factor decreasing with the qubit number and circuit depth, i.e. the performance of purification is better for larger circuits.

In this method, the molecular sample interacts with three pulse trains derived from the DFC and the generated third-order signal is displayed as a two-dimensional (2D) spectrum that depends on the waiting time introduced by employing asynchronous optical sampling method. Through the analysis of the heterodyne-detected signal interferogram using a local oscillator derived from one of the optical frequency combs, we show that the 2D spectrum closely matches the spectrum expected from a conventional approach with four pulses derived from a single femtosecond laser pulse and the waiting time between the second and third field-matter interactions is given by the down-converted detection time of the interferogram. The theoretical result is applied to a two-level model system with solvation effect described by solvatochromic spectral density. The model 2D spectrum reproduces spectral features such as the loss of frequency correlation, dephasing, and spectral shift as a function of the population time. We anticipate that the present theory will be the general framework for quantitative descriptions of DFC-based nonlinear optical spectroscopy.},

Femtosecond 2D Fourier transform (2D FT) spectra are more flexible and share some of the remarkable properties of their conceptual parent, 2D FT nuclear magnetic resonance. When 2D FT spectra are experimentally separated into real absorptive and imaginary refractive parts, the time resolution and frequency resolution can both reach the uncertainty limit set for each resonance by the sample itself. Coherent four-level contributions to the signal provide new molecular phase information, such as relative signs of transition dipoles. The nonlinear response can be picked apart by selecting a single coherence pathway (e.g., specifying the relative signs of energy level difference frequencies during different time intervals as in the photon echo). Because molecules are frozen on the femtosecond timescale, femtosecond 2D FT experiments can separate a distribution of instantaneous molecular environments and intramolecular geometries as inhomogeneous broadening. This review provides an introduction to two-dimensional Fourier transform experiments exploiting second- and third-order vibrational and electronic nonlinearities.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers hold promise to circumvent the limitations of conventional computing for difficult molecular problems. However, the accumulation of quantum logic errors on real devices represents a major challenge, particularly in the pursuit of chemical accuracy requiring the inclusion of dynamical effects. In this work we implement the quantum computed moments (QCM) approach for hydrogen chain molecular systems up to H\$\_6\$. On a superconducting quantum processor, Hamiltonian moments, \$\textbackslash langle \textbackslash mathcal\{H\}\^p\textbackslash rangle\$ are computed with respect to the Hartree-Fock state, which are then employed in Lanczos expansion theory to determine an estimate for the ground-state energy which incorporates electronic correlations and manifestly improves on the variational result. Post-processing purification of the raw QCM data takes the estimate through the Hartree-Fock variational limit to within 99.9\% of the exact electronic ground-state energy for the largest system studied, H\$\_6\$. Calculated dissociation curves indicate precision at about 10mH for this system and as low as 0.1mH for molecular hydrogen, H\$\_2\$, over a range of bond lengths. In the context of stringent precision requirements for chemical problems, these results provide strong evidence for the error suppression capability of the QCM method, particularly when coupled with post-processing error mitigation. Greater emphasis on more efficient representations of the Hamiltonian and classical preprocessing steps may enable the solution of larger systems on near-term quantum processors.},

We here propose a quantum variational (QuVa) PDE solver with the aid of machine learning (ML) schemes to synergise two emerging technologies in mathematically hard problems. The core quantum processing in this solver is to calculate efficiently the expectation value of specially designed quantum operators. For a large quantum system, we only obtain data from measurements of few control qubits to avoid the exponential cost in the measurements of the whole quantum system and optimise a pathway to find possible solution sets of the desired PDEs using ML techniques. As an example, a few different types of the second-order DEs are examined with randomly chosen samples and a regression method is implemented to chase the best candidates of solution functions with another trial samples. We demonstrated that a three-qubit system successfully follows the pattern of analytical solutions of three different DEs with high fidelity since the variational solutions are given by a necessary condition to obtain the exact solution of the DEs. Thus, we believe that final solution candidate sets are efficiently extracted from the QuVa PDE solver with the support of ML techniques and this algorithm could be beneficial to search for the solutions of complex mathematical problems as well as to find good ansatzs for eigenstates in large quantum systems (e.g., for quantum chemistry).},

Yet, because of the inherent fragile nature of the physical computing elements, qubits, achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low error rates for qubit operations as well as a significant overhead of physical qubits, in order to realize fault-tolerance via quantum error correction. However, recent theoretical work has shown that the accuracy of computation based off expectation values of quantum observables can be enhanced through an extrapolation of results from a collection of varying noisy experiments. Here, we demonstrate this error mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors on canonical single- and two-qubit experiments and then extend its application to the variational optimization of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism. We effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps unearth otherwise inaccessible accuracies to the variational solutions using our noisy processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will be critical to significantly enhance the capabilities of near-term quantum computing hardware.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices has raised the question of whether or not these devices will find commercial use. Unfortunately, a major shortcoming of many proposed NISQ-amenable algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), is coming into view: the algorithms require too many independent quantum measurements to solve practical problems in a reasonable amount of time. This motivates the central question of our work: how might we speed up such algorithms in spite of the impact of error on NISQ computations? We demonstrate on quantum hardware that the estimation of expectation values, a core subroutine of many quantum algorithms including VQE, can be improved in terms of precision and accuracy by using a technique we call Robust Amplitude Estimation. Consequently, this method reduces the runtime to achieve the same mean-squared error compared to the standard prepare-and-measure estimation method. The surprising result is that by using deeper, and therefore more error-prone, quantum circuits, we realize more accurate quantum computations in less time. As the quality of quantum devices improves, this method will provide a proportional reduction in estimation runtime. This technique may be used to speed up quantum computations into the regime of early fault-tolerant quantum computation and aid in the realization of quantum advantage.},

  abstract = {We propose quantum algorithms for projective ground-state preparation and calculations of the many-body Green's functions directly in frequency domain. The algorithms are based on the linear combination of unitary (LCU) operations and essentially only use quantum resources. To prepare the ground state, we construct the operator \$\{\textbackslash exp\}(-\textbackslash tau \textbackslash hat\{H\}\^2)\$ using Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation by LCU and apply it on an easy-to-prepare initial state. Our projective state preparation procedure saturates the near-optimal scaling, \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash Delta\} \textbackslash log \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash eta\})\$, of other currently known algorithms, in terms of the spectral-gap lower bound \$\textbackslash Delta\$, the additive error \$\textbackslash eta\$ in the state vector, and the overlap lower bound \$\textbackslash gamma\$ between the initial state and the exact ground state. It is straightforward to combine our algorithm with spectral-gap amplification technique to achieve quadratically improved scaling \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Delta\})\$ for ground-state preparation of frustration-free Hamiltonians, which we demonstrate with numerical results of the \$q\$-deformed XXZ chain. To compute the Green's functions, including the single-particle and other response functions, we act on the prepared ground state with the retarded resolvent operator \$R(\textbackslash omega + i\textbackslash Gamma; \textbackslash hat\{H\})\$ in the LCU form derived from the Fourier-Laplace integral transform (FIT). Our resolvent algorithm has \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash Gamma\^2\} \textbackslash log\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash Gamma\textbackslash epsilon\})\$ complexity scaling for the frequency resolution \$\textbackslash Gamma\$ of the response functions and the targeted error \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, while classical algorithms for FIT usually have polynomial scaling over the error \$\textbackslash epsilon\$. To illustrate the complexity scaling of our algorithms, we provide numerical results for their application to the paradigmatic Fermi-Hubbard model on a one-dimensional lattice with different numbers of sites.},

We show that our model can be trained end-to-end by maximizing a well-defined loss-function: a 'quantum' lower-bound to a variational approximation of the log-likelihood. We use quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to train and evaluate the performance of QVAEs. To achieve the best performance, we first create a VAE platform with discrete latent space generated by a restricted Boltzmann machine. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST dataset when compared against similar approaches that only involve discrete variables in the generative process. We consider QVAEs with a smaller number of latent units to be able to perform QMC simulations, which are computationally expensive. We show that QVAEs can be trained effectively in regimes where quantum effects are relevant despite training via the quantum bound. Our findings open the way to the use of quantum computers to train QVAEs to achieve competitive performance for generative models. Placing a QBM in the latent space of a VAE leverages the full potential of current and next-generation quantum computers as sampling devices.},

The method is based on a MERA-like tensor network that can be efficiently and reliably contracted on a noisy quantum computer using a number of qubits that is much smaller than the system size. We prove that the outcome of the contraction is stable to noise and that the estimated energy upper bounds the ground state energy. The stability, which we numerically substantiate, follows from the positivity of operator scaling dimensions under renormalization group flow. The variational upper bound follows from a particular assignment of physical qubits to different locations of the tensor network plus the assumption that the noise model is local. We postulate a scaling law for how well the tensor network can approximate ground states of lattice regulated conformal field theories in d spatial dimensions and provide evidence for the postulate. Under this postulate, a \$O(\textbackslash log\^\{d\}(1/\textbackslash delta))\$-qubit quantum computer can prepare a valid quantum-mechanical state with energy density \$\textbackslash delta\$ above the ground state. In the presence of noise, \$\textbackslash delta = O(\textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash log\^\{d+1\}(1/\textbackslash epsilon))\$ can be achieved, where \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ is the noise strength.},

Two works have recently introduced the very promising Error Suppression by Derangements (ESD) and Virtual Distillation (VD) techniques. The approach exponentially suppresses errors and ultimately allows one to measure expectation values in the pure state as the dominant eigenvector of the noisy quantum state. Interestingly this dominant eigenvector is, however, different than the ideal computational state and it is the aim of the present work to comprehensively explore the following fundamental question: how significantly different are these two pure states? The motivation for this work is two-fold. First, comprehensively understanding the effect of this coherent mismatch is of fundamental importance for the successful exploitation of noisy quantum devices. As such, the present work rigorously establishes that in practically relevant scenarios the coherent mismatch is exponentially less severe than the incoherent decay of the fidelity -- where the latter can be suppressed exponentially via the ESD/VD technique. Second, the above question is closely related to central problems in mathematics, such as bounding eigenvalues of a sum of two matrices (Weyl inequalities) -- solving of which was a major breakthrough. The present work can be viewed as a first step towards extending the Weyl inequalities to eigenvectors of a sum of two matrices -- and completely resolves this problem for the special case of the considered density matrices.},

  abstract = {As quantum computers mature, quantum error correcting codes (QECs) will be adopted in order to suppress errors to any desired level \$E\$ at a cost in qubit-count \$n\$ that is merely poly-logarithmic in \$1/E\$. However in the NISQ era, the complexity and scale required to adopt even the smallest QEC is prohibitive. Instead, error mitigation techniques have been employed; typically these do not require an increase in qubit-count but cannot provide exponential error suppression. Here we show that, for the crucial case of estimating expectation values of observables (key to almost all NISQ algorithms) one can indeed achieve an effective exponential suppression. We introduce the Error Suppression by Derangement (ESD) approach: by increasing the qubit count by a factor of \$n\textbackslash geq 2\$, the error is suppressed exponentially as \$Q\^n\$ where \$Q{$<$}1\$ is a suppression factor that depends on the entropy of the errors. The ESD approach takes \$n\$ independently-prepared circuit outputs and applies a controlled derangement operator to create a state whose symmetries prevent erroneous states from contributing to expected values. The approach is therefore `NISQ-friendly' as it is modular in the main computation and requires only a shallow circuit that bridges the \$n\$ copies immediately prior to measurement. Imperfections in our derangement circuit do degrade performance and therefore we propose an approach to mitigate this effect to arbitrary precision due to the remarkable properties of derangements. a) they decompose into a linear number of elementary gates -- limiting the impact of noise b) they are highly resilient to noise and the effect of imperfections on them is (almost) trivial. In numerical simulations validating our approach we confirm error suppression below \$10\^\{-6\}\$ for circuits consisting of several hundred noisy gates (two-qubit gate error \$0.5\textbackslash\%\$) using no more than \$n=4\$ circuit copies.},

When the circuit elements are limited to a subset of SU(4)\textemdash or equivalently, when the Hamiltonian may be mapped onto free fermionic models\textemdash several identities exist that combine and simplify the circuit. Based on this, we present an algorithm that compresses the Trotter steps into a single block of quantum gates using algebraic relations between adjacent circuit elements. This results in a fixed depth time evolution for certain classes of Hamiltonians. We explicitly show how this algorithm works for several spin models, and demonstrate its use for adiabatic state preparation of the transverse field Ising model.},

  abstract = {A promising approach to useful computational quantum advantage is to use variational quantum algorithms for optimisation problems. Crucial for the performance of these algorithms is to ensure that the algorithm converges with high probability to a near-optimal solution in a small time. In Barkoutsos et al (Quantum 2020) an alternative class of objective functions, called Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), was introduced and it was shown that they perform better than standard objective functions. Here we extend that work by introducing an evolving objective function, which we call Ascending-CVaR and that can be used for any optimisation problem. We test our proposed objective function, in an emulation environment, using as case-studies three different optimisation problems: Max-Cut, Number Partitioning and Portfolio Optimisation. We examine multiple instances of different sizes and analyse the performance using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with hardware-efficient ansatz and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We show that Ascending-CVaR in all cases performs better than standard objective functions or the "constant" CVaR of Barkoutsos et al (Quantum 2020) and that it can be used as a heuristic for avoiding sub-optimal minima. Our proposal achieves higher overlap with the ideal state in all problems, whether we consider easy or hard instances -- on average it gives up to ten times greater overlap at Portfolio Optimisation and Number Partitioning, while it gives an 80\% improvement at Max-Cut. In the hard instances we consider, for the number partitioning problem, standard objective functions fail to find the correct solution in almost all cases, CVaR finds the correct solution at 60\% of the cases, while Ascending-CVaR finds the correct solution in 95\% of the cases.},

For fault-tolerant operation quantum computers must correct errors occurring due to unavoidable decoherence and limited control accuracy. Here, we demonstrate quantum error correction using the surface code, which is known for its exceptionally high tolerance to errors. Using 17 physical qubits in a superconducting circuit we encode quantum information in a distance-three logical qubit building up on recent distance-two error detection experiments. In an error correction cycle taking only \$1.1\textbackslash,\textbackslash mu\$s, we demonstrate the preservation of four cardinal states of the logical qubit. Repeatedly executing the cycle, we measure and decode both bit- and phase-flip error syndromes using a minimum-weight perfect-matching algorithm in an error-model-free approach and apply corrections in postprocessing. We find a low error probability of \$3\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ per cycle when rejecting experimental runs in which leakage is detected. The measured characteristics of our device agree well with a numerical model. Our demonstration of repeated, fast and high-performance quantum error correction cycles, together with recent advances in ion traps, support our understanding that fault-tolerant quantum computation will be practically realizable.},

We dispute this argument by showing that the empirical Fisher---unlike the Fisher---does not generally capture second-order information. We further argue that the conditions under which the empirical Fisher approaches the Fisher (and the Hessian) are unlikely to be met in practice, and that, even on simple optimization problems, the pathologies of the empirical Fisher can have undesirable effects.},

One of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers is quantum chemistry. It has been expected that simulations of molecules via molecular dynamics can be also efficiently performed on near-term quantum computers by applying a promising near-term quantum algorithm of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). However, this method may demand considerable computational costs to achieve a sufficient accuracy, and otherwise, statistical noise can significantly affect the results. To resolve these problems, we invent an efficient method for molecular time evolution inspired by Car-Parrinello method. In our method, parameters characterizing the quantum state evolve based on equations of motion instead of being optimized. Furthermore, by considering Langevin dynamics, we can make use of the intrinsic statistical noise. As an application of QCPMD, we propose an efficient method for vibrational frequency analysis of molecules in which we can use the results of the molecular dynamics calculated by QCPMD. Numerical experiments show that our method can precisely simulate the Langevin dynamics at the equilibrium state, and we can successfully predict a given molecule's eigen frequencies. Furthermore, in the numerical simulation, our method achieves a substantial cost reduction compared with molecular dynamics using the VQE. Our method achieves an efficient computation without using widely employed method of the VQE. In this sense, we open up a new possibility of molecular dynamics on near-term quantum computers. We expect our results inspire further invention of efficient near-term quantum algorithms for simulation of molecules.},

  abstract = {Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have received considerable attention due to their potential for achieving near-term quantum advantage. However, more work is needed to understand their scalability. One known scaling result for VQAs is barren plateaus, where certain circumstances lead to exponentially vanishing gradients. It is common folklore that problem-inspired ansatzes avoid barren plateaus, but in fact, very little is known about their gradient scaling. In this work we employ tools from quantum optimal control to develop a framework that can diagnose the presence or absence of barren plateaus for problem-inspired ansatzes. Such ansatzes include the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA), the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA), and others. With our framework, we prove that avoiding barren plateaus for these ansatzes is not always guaranteed. Specifically, we show that the gradient scaling of the VQA depends on the controllability of the system, and hence can be diagnosed trough the dynamical Lie algebra \$\textbackslash mathfrak\{g\}\$ obtained from the generators of the ansatz. We analyze the existence of barren plateaus in QAOA and HVA ansatzes, and we highlight the role of the input state, as different initial states can lead to the presence or absence of barren plateaus. Taken together, our results provide a framework for trainability-aware ansatz design strategies that do not come at the cost of extra quantum resources. Moreover, we prove no-go results for obtaining ground states with variational ansatzes for controllable system such as spin glasses. We finally provide evidence that barren plateaus can be linked to dimension of \$\textbackslash mathfrak\{g\}\$.},

We compare its performance in both efficiency of implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing the full generalized SD excitation operators (UCCGSD), as well as with the standard ansatz employing only SD excitations (UCCSD). \$k\$-UpCCGSD is found to show the best scaling for quantum computing applications, requiring a circuit depth of \$\textbackslash mathcal O(kN)\$, compared with \$\textbackslash mathcal O(N\^3)\$ for UCCGSD and \$\textbackslash mathcal O((N-\textbackslash eta)\^2 \textbackslash eta)\$ for UCCSD where \$N\$ is the number of spin orbitals and \$\textbackslash eta\$ is the number of electrons.

The results for ground states show that \$k\$-UpCCGSD offers a good tradeoff between accuracy and cost, achieving chemical accuracy for lower cost of implementation on quantum computers than both UCCGSD and UCCSD. Excited states are calculated with an orthogonally constrained variational quantum eigensolver approach. This is seen to generally yield less accurate energies than for the corresponding ground states. We demonstrate that using a specialized multi-determinantal reference state constructed from classical linear response calculations allows these excited state energetics to be improved.},

This duality manifests itself both in the algebraic sense of adjointness of quantum channels and in the operational sense that a universal cloning machine can be used as an approximate recovery channel for a symmetrized partial trace channel and vice versa. The duality extends to give control of the performance of generalized universal quantum cloning machines (UQCMs) on subspaces more general than the symmetric subspace. This gives a way to quantify the usefulness of a priori information in the context of cloning. For example, we can control the performance of an antisymmetric analog of the UQCM in recovering from the loss of n - k fermionic particles.},

The impact of such errors is minimized by boosting them artificially and then extrapolating to the zero-error case. In comparison to a more conventional optimized Trotterization technique, we find that our protocol is efficient and appears to be fundamentally more robust against error accumulation.},

The long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) models are used to simulate the long-time quantum dynamics, which are built based on the key information of the short-time evolution. We employ various hyperparameter optimization methods, including simulated annealing, Bayesian optimization with tree-structured parzen estimator, and random search, to achieve the automatic construction and adjustment of the LSTM-RNN models. The implementation details of three hyperparameter optimization methods are examined, and among them, the simulated annealing approach is strongly recommended due to its excellent performance. The uncertainties of the machine learning models are comprehensively analyzed by the combination of bootstrap sampling and Monte Carlo dropout approaches, which give the prediction confidence of the LSTM-RNN models in the simulation of the open quantum dynamics. This work builds an effective machine learning approach to simulate the dynamics evolution of open quantum systems. In addition, the current study provides an efficient protocol to build optimal neural networks and estimate the trustiness of the machine learning models.},

Instead of fixing a variational ansatz at the beginning of the simulation, the circuit is grown systematically during the time evolution. Moreover, the adaptive step does not require auxiliary qubits and the gate search can be performed in parallel on different quantum devices. We apply the new algorithm, named Adaptive pVQD, to the simulation of driven spin models and fermionic systems, where it shows an advantage when compared to both Trotterized circuits and non-adaptive variational methods.

The effective force and effective mass matrix are important elements in the equations of motion of equilibrium continuity dynamics, where only the zeroth term of an exact series expansion of the phase space propagator is involved. We introduce a machine learning approach for fitting these elements in quantum phase space, leading to a much more efficient integration of the equations of motion.

Usually, the measurement is trained to distinguish quantum-embedded data. We propose to instead train the first part of the circuit---the embedding---with the objective of maximally separating data classes in Hilbert space, a strategy we call quantum metric learning. As a result, the measurement minimizing a linear classification loss is already known and depends on the metric used: for embeddings separating data using the l1 or trace distance, this is the Helstrom measurement, while for the l2 or Hilbert-Schmidt distance, it is a simple overlap measurement. This approach provides a powerful analytic framework for quantum machine learning and eliminates a major component in current models, freeing up more precious resources to best leverage the capabilities of near-term quantum information processors.},

Our approach, called variable-noise Clifford data regression (vnCDR), significantly outperforms these individual methods in numerical benchmarks. vnCDR generates training data first via near-Clifford circuits (which are classically simulable) and second by varying the noise levels in these circuits. We employ a noise model obtained from IBM's Ourense quantum computer to benchmark our method.

  abstract = {We propose a simple scheme to reduce read-out errors in experiments on quantum systems with finite number of measurement outcomes. Our method relies on performing classical post-processing which is preceded by Quantum Detector Tomography, i.e., the reconstruction of a Positive-Operator Valued Measure (POVM) describing the given quantum measurement device. If the measurement device is affected only by an invertible classical noise, it is possible to correct the outcome statistics of future experiments performed on the same device. To support the practical applicability of this scheme for near-term quantum devices, we characterize measurements implemented in IBM's and Rigetti's quantum processors. We find that for these devices, based on superconducting transmon qubits, classical noise is indeed the dominant source of read-out errors. Moreover, we analyze the influence of the presence of coherent errors and finite statistics on the performance of our error-mitigation procedure. Applying our scheme on the IBM's 5-qubit device, we observe a significant improvement of the results of a number of single-and two-qubit tasks including Quantum State Tomography (QST), Quantum Process Tomography (QPT), the implementation of non-projective measurements, and certain quantum algorithms (Grover's search and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm). Finally, we present results showing improvement for the implementation of certain probability distributions in the case of five qubits.},

Specifically, we successfully obtain energies, entanglement entropies, and orientational correlations that are in agreement with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), which has been previously used for this system. We find that the entropies calculated by ML-MCTDH for larger system sizes contain nonmonotonicity, as expected in the vicinity of a second-order quantum phase transition between ordered and disordered rotor states. We observe that this effect remains when all couplings besides nearest-neighbor are omitted from the Hamiltonian, which suggests that it is not sensitive to the rate of decay of the interactions. In contrast to DMRG, which is tailored to the one-dimensional case, ML-MCTDH (as implemented in the Heidelberg MCTDH package) requires more computational time and memory, although the requirements are still within reach of commodity hardware. The numerical convergence and computational demand of two practical implementations of ML-MCTDH and DMRG are presented in detail for various combinations of system parameters.}

We first review the progress in ultrafast optics, which has enabled the generation of broadly tunable light pulses with duration down to a few optical cycles; we then discuss the pump\textendash probe technique, showing examples of its capability to combine very high time resolution, down to the attosecond regime, with broad spectral coverage; we introduce two-dimensional spectroscopy and present results that demonstrate the additional information content provided by the combination of temporal and spectral resolution. Next, we review the achievements of ultrafast X-ray and electron diffraction, which provide time-dependent structural information on photochemical processes, and we conclude with a critical analysis of the future open challenges in the field.}

  abstract = {We perform quantum dynamics simulations to investigate new chemical reactivities enabled by cavity quantum electrodynamics. The quantum light\textendash matter interactions between the molecule and the quantized radiation mode inside an optical cavity create a set of hybridized electronic\textendash photonic states, so-called polaritons. The polaritonic states adapt the curvatures from both the ground and the excited electronic states, opening up new possibilities to control photochemical reactions by exploiting intrinsic quantum behaviors of light\textendash matter interactions. With quantum dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the selectivity of a model photoisomerization reaction can be controlled by tuning the photon frequency of the cavity mode or the light\textendash matter coupling strength, providing new ways to manipulate chemical reactions via the light\textendash matter interaction. We further investigate collective quantum effects enabled by coupling the quantized radiation mode to multiple molecules. Our results suggest that in the resonance case, a photon is recycled among molecules to enable multiple excited state reactions, thus effectively functioning as a catalyst. In the nonresonance case, molecules emit and absorb virtual photons to initiate excited state reactions through fundamental quantum electrodynamics processes. These results from quantum dynamics simulations reveal basic principles of polariton photochemistry as well as promising reactivities that take advantage of intrinsic quantum behaviors of photons.},

Choosing these single-particle functions to be themselves multidimensional wavefunctions which are represented using a MCTDH representation, a multilayer MCTDH scheme has been constructed and used for quantum dynamics calculations treating up to 1000degrees of freedom rigorously [Wang and Thoss, J. Chem. Phys. 199, 1289 (2003)]. The present work gives a practical scheme which facilitates the application of the multilayer MCTDH approach, which previously has only been employed to study systems described by model-type Hamiltonians, to molecular systems described by more complicated Hamiltonians and general potential energy surfaces. A multilayer extension of the correlation discrete variable representation (CDVR) scheme employed in MCTDH calculations studying quantum dynamics on general potential energy surfaces is developed and tested in a simple numerical application. The resulting multilayer MCTDH/CDVR approach might offer a perspective to rigorously describe the quantum dynamics of larger polyatomic systems.}

  abstract = {Hamiltonian simulation is a fundamental problem at the heart of quantum computation, and the associated simulation algorithms are useful building blocks for designing larger quantum algorithms. In order to be successfully concatenated into a larger quantum algorithm, a Hamiltonian simulation algorithm must succeed with arbitrarily high success probability \$1-\textbackslash delta\$ while only requiring a single copy of the initial state, a property which we call fully-coherent. Although optimal Hamiltonian simulation has been achieved by quantum signal processing (QSP), with query complexity linear in time \$t\$ and logarithmic in inverse error \$\textbackslash ln(1/\textbackslash epsilon)\$, the corresponding algorithm is not fully-coherent as it only succeeds with probability close to \$1/4\$. While this simulation algorithm can be made fully-coherent by employing amplitude amplification at the expense of appending a \$\textbackslash ln(1/\textbackslash delta)\$ multiplicative factor to the query complexity, here we develop a new fully-coherent Hamiltonian simulation algorithm that achieves a query complexity additive in \$\textbackslash ln(1/\textbackslash delta)\$: \$\textbackslash Theta\textbackslash big( \textbackslash |\textbackslash mathcal\{H\}\textbackslash | |t| + \textbackslash ln(1/\textbackslash epsilon) + \textbackslash ln(1/\textbackslash delta)\textbackslash big)\$. We accomplish this by compressing the spectrum of the Hamiltonian with an affine transformation, and applying to it a QSP polynomial that approximates the complex exponential only over the range of the compressed spectrum. We further numerically analyze the complexity of this algorithm and demonstrate its application to the simulation of the Heisenberg model in constant and time-dependent external magnetic fields. We believe that this efficient fully-coherent Hamiltonian simulation algorithm can serve as a useful subroutine in quantum algorithms where maintaining coherence is paramount.},

  abstract = {Quantum algorithms offer significant speedups over their classical counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms were recently tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In the seminal GSLW'19 paper on QSVT [Gily\textbackslash 'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe, ACM STOC 2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification, methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here, we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum eigenvalue transform, from which QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19, we then employ QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates how QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms, thus suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.},

In this paper, we present an implementation of Lanczos Algorithm on GPU using the CUDA programming model and apply it to two important problems : graph bisection using spectral methods, and image segmentation. Our GPU implementation of spectral bisection performs better when compared to both an Intel Math Kernel Library implementation and a Matlab implementation. Our GPU implementation shows a speedup up to 97.3 times over Matlab Implementation and 2.89 times over the Intel Math Kernel Library implementation on a Intel Core i7 920 Processor, which is a quad-core CPU. Similarly, our image segmentation implementation achieves a speed up of 3.27 compared to a multicore CPU based implementation using Intel Math Kernel Library and OpenMP. Through this work, we therefore wish to establish that the GPU may still be a better platform for also highly irregular and computationally intensive applications.},

One powerful example of such a hybrid quantum-classical approach optimized for classically intractable eigenvalue problems is the variational quantum eigensolver, built to utilize quantum resources for the solution of eigenvalue problems and optimizations with minimal coherence time requirements by leveraging classical computational resources. These algorithms have been placed as leaders among the candidates for the first to achieve supremacy over classical computation. Here, we provide evidence for the conjecture that variational approaches can automatically suppress even nonsystematic decoherence errors by introducing an exactly solvable channel model of variational state preparation. Moreover, we develop a more general hierarchy of measurement and classical computation that allows one to obtain increasingly accurate solutions by leveraging additional measurements and classical resources. We demonstrate numerically on a sample electronic system that this method both allows for the accurate determination of excited electronic states as well as reduces the impact of decoherence, without using any additional quantum coherence time or formal error-correction codes.},

In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through relaxation of exponential splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure.

  abstract = {With the rapid development of quantum technology, one of the leading applications is the simulation of chemistry. Interestingly, even before full scale quantum computers are available, quantum computer science has exhibited a remarkable string of results that directly impact what is possible in chemical simulation with any computer. Some of these results even impact our understanding of chemistry in the real world. In this perspective, we take the position that direct chemical simulation is best understood as a digital experiment. While on one hand this clarifies the power of quantum computers to extend our reach, it also shows us the limitations of taking such an approach too directly. Leveraging results that quantum computers cannot outpace the physical world, we build to the controversial stance that some chemical problems are best viewed as problems for which no algorithm can deliver their solution in general, known in computer science as undecidable problems. This has implications for the predictive power of thermodynamic models and topics like the ergodic hypothesis. However, we argue that this perspective is not defeatist, but rather helps shed light on the success of existing chemical models like transition state theory, molecular orbital theory, and thermodynamics as models that benefit from data. We contextualize recent results showing that data-augmented models are more powerful rote simulation. These results help us appreciate the success of traditional chemical theory and anticipate new models learned from experimental data. Not only can quantum computers provide data for such models, but they can extend the class and power of models that utilize data in fundamental ways. These discussions culminate in speculation on new ways for quantum computing and chemistry to interact and our perspective on the eventual roles of quantum computers in the future of chemistry.},

We perform randomized benchmarking using a Clifford set of Hadamard and Z gates and show that the error per Clifford is reduced versus a set consisting of standard finite-duration X and Y gates. Z gates can correct unitary rotation errors for weakly anharmonic qubits as an alternative to pulse-shaping techniques such as derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG). We investigate leakage and show that a combination of DRAG pulse shaping to minimize leakage and Z gates to correct rotation errors realizes a 13.3 ns X{$\pi$}/2 gate characterized by low error [1.95(3)\texttimes 10-4] and low leakage [3.1(6)\texttimes 10-6].

Due to finite coherence times and gate errors, the number of gates that can be implemented remains limited. In this work, we propose an alternative algorithm where device-level pulse shapes are variationally optimized for the state preparation rather than using an abstract-level quantum circuit. In doing so, the coherence time required for the state preparation is drastically reduced. We numerically demonstrate this by directly optimizing pulse shapes which accurately model the dissociation of H2 and HeH+, and we compute the ground state energy for LiH with four transmons where we see reductions in state preparation times of roughly three orders of magnitude compared to gate-based strategies.},

Finally, after the general conclusions, the perspectives in the field of TR-IR applied to photosynthesis are described.},

Although the eigenenergies are certainly important quantities which determine properties of a given system, their derivatives with respect to parameters of the system, such as positions of nuclei if we target a quantum chemistry problem, are also crucial to analyze the system. Here, we describe methods to evaluate analytical derivatives of the eigenenergy of a given Hamiltonian, including the excited state energy as well as the ground-state energy, with respect to the system parameters in the framework of the VQE. We give explicit, low-depth quantum circuits which can measure essential quantities to evaluate energy derivatives, incorporating with proof-of-principle numerical simulations. This work extends the theory of the variational quantum eigensolver, by enabling it to measure more physical properties of a quantum system than before and to explore chemical reactions.},

Before the full power of such machines will be available, near-term quantum devices will provide several hundred qubits and limited error correction. Still, there is a realistic prospect to run useful algorithms within the limited circuit depth of such devices. Particularly promising are optimization algorithms that follow a hybrid approach: the aim is to steer a highly entangled state on a quantum system to a target state that minimizes a cost function via variation of some gate parameters. This variational approach can be used both for classical optimization problems as well as for problems in quantum chemistry. The challenge is to converge to the target state given the limited coherence time and connectivity of the qubits. In this context, the quantum volume as a metric to compare the power of near-term quantum devices is discussed. With focus on chemistry applications, a general description of variational algorithms is provided and the mapping from fermions to qubits is explained. Coupled-cluster and heuristic trial wave-functions are considered for efficiently finding molecular ground states. Furthermore, simple error-mitigation schemes are introduced that could improve the accuracy of determining ground-state energies. Advancing these techniques may lead to near-term demonstrations of useful quantum computation with systems containing several hundred qubits.},

Helical cholesteric arrangements are formed by mixing chiral binaphthalene derivatives with the intrinsically achiral polyfluorene-based copolymer F8BT. The induced circular dichroism (ICD) response of F8BT shows a mirror-image-like shape when the chirality of the additive is changed. Peaks in the CD spectra reach large absolute values of about 800 mdeg. Photoexcitation by ultrashort laser pulses results in TrCD spectra of opposite sign for cholesteric polymer films of different helicity, demonstrating transient chiral discrimination on the femtosecond time scale over the wavelength range 260\textendash 700 nm. Differences between the excited-state and ground-state CD spectra considerably depend on the electronic transition.

  abstract = {The one-clean qubit model (or the DQC1 model) is a restricted model of quantum computing where only a single qubit of the initial state is pure and others are maximally mixed. Although the model is not universal, it can efficiently solve several problems whose classical efficient solutions are not known. Furthermore, it was recently shown that if the one-clean qubit model is classically efficiently simulated, the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the second level. A disadvantage of the one-clean qubit model is, however, that the clean qubit is too clean: for example, in realistic NMR experiments, polarizations are not enough high to have the perfectly pure qubit. In this paper, we consider a more realistic one-clean qubit model, where the clean qubit is not clean, but depolarized. We first show that, for any polarization, a multiplicative-error calculation of the output probability distribution of the model is possible in a classical polynomial time if we take an appropriately large multiplicative error. The result is in a strong contrast to that of the ideal one-clean qubit model where the classical efficient multiplicative-error calculation (or even the sampling) with the same amount of error causes the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. We next show that, for any polarization lower-bounded by an inverse polynomial, a classical efficient sampling (in terms of a sufficiently small multiplicative error or an exponentially-small additive error) of the output probability distribution of the model is impossible unless BQP is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, which suggests the hardness of the classical efficient simulation of the one non-clean qubit model.},

  abstract = {Catalysts are widely used to increase reaction rates. They function by stabilizing the transition state of the reaction at their active site, where the atomic arrangement ensures favourable interactions 1 . However, mechanistic understanding is often limited when catalysts possess multiple active sites-such as sites associated with either the step edges or the close-packed terraces of inorganic nanoparticles2-4-with distinct activities that cannot be measured simultaneously. An example is the oxidation of carbon monoxide over platinum surfaces, one of the oldest and best studied heterogeneous reactions. In 1824, this reaction was recognized to be crucial for the function of the Davy safety lamp, and today it is used to optimize combustion, hydrogen production and fuel-cell operation5,6. The carbon dioxide products are formed in a bimodal kinetic energy distribution7-13; however, despite extensive study 5 , it remains unclear whether this reflects the involvement of more than one reaction mechanism occurring at multiple active sites12,13. Here we show that the reaction rates at different active sites can be measured simultaneously, using molecular beams to controllably introduce reactants and slice ion imaging14,15 to map the velocity vectors of the product molecules, which reflect the symmetry and the orientation of the active site 16 . We use this velocity-resolved kinetics approach to map the oxidation rates of carbon monoxide at step edges and terrace sites on platinum surfaces, and find that the reaction proceeds through two distinct channels11-13: it is dominated at low temperatures by the more active step sites, and at high temperatures by the more abundant terrace sites. We expect our approach to be applicable to a wide range of heterogeneous reactions and to provide improved mechanistic understanding of the contribution of different active sites, which should be useful in the design of improved catalysts.},

  abstract = {A general theory of quantum stochastic processes was formulated by Accardi, Frigerio and Lewis in 1982 within the operator-algebraic framework of quantum probability theory, as a non-commutative extension of the Kolmogorovian classical stochastic processes. More recently, studies on non-Markovian quantum processes have led to the discrete-time process tensor formalism in the Schr\textbackslash "\{o\}dinger picture to describe the outcomes of sequential interventions on open quantum systems. However, there has been no treatment of the relationship of the process tensor formalism to the quantum probabilistic theory of quantum stochastic processes. This paper gives an exposition of quantum stochastic processes and the process tensor and the relationship between them. In particular, it is shown how the latter emerges from the former via extended correlation kernels incorporating ancillas.},

Accurate calculations of derivatives of molecular eigenenergies are essential toward this end, allowing for geometry optimization, transition state searches, predictions of the response to an applied electric or magnetic field, and molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we survey methods to calculate energy derivatives, and present two new methods: one based on quantum phase estimation, the other on a low-order response approximation. We calculate asymptotic error bounds and approximate computational scalings for the methods presented. Implementing these methods, we perform geometry optimization on an experimental quantum processor, estimating the equilibrium bond length of the dihydrogen molecule to within \$\$0.014\$\$\,\AA{} of the full configuration interaction value. Within the same experiment, we estimate the polarizability of the H\$\$\{\}\_\{2\}\$\$ molecule, finding agreement at the equilibrium bond length to within \$\$0.06\$\$ a.u.

  abstract = {ConspectusSimulating molecular dynamics (MD) within a comprehensive quantum framework has been a long-standing challenge in computational chemistry. An exponential scaling of computational cost renders solving the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) of a molecular Hamiltonian, including both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom (DOFs), as well as their couplings, infeasible for more than a few DOFs. In the Born\textendash Oppenheimer (BO), or adiabatic, picture, electronic and nuclear parts of the wave function are decoupled and treated separately. Within this framework, the nuclear wave function evolves along potential energy surfaces (PESs) computed as solutions to the electronic Schr\"odinger equation parametrized in the nuclear DOFs. This approximation, together with increasingly elaborate numerical approaches to solve the nuclear time dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE), enabled the treatment of up to a few dozens of degrees of freedom (DOFs). However, for particular applications, such as photochemistry, the BO approximation breaks down. In this regime of non-adiabatic dynamics, solving the full molecular problem including electron\textendash nuclear couplings becomes essential, further increasing the complexity of the numerical solution. Although valuable methods such as multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) have been proposed for the solution of the coupled electron\textendash nuclear dynamics, they remain hampered by an exponential scaling in the number of nuclear DOFs and by the difficulty of finding universal variational forms.In this Account, we present a perspective on novel quantum computational algorithms, aiming to alleviate the exponential scaling inherent to the simulation of many-body quantum dynamics. In particular, we focus on the derivation and application of quantum algorithms for adiabatic and non-adiabatic quantum dynamics, which include efficient approaches for the calculation of the BO potential energy surfaces (PESs). Thereafter, we study the time-evolution of a model system consisting of two coupled PESs in first and second quantization. In a first application, we discuss a recently introduced quantum algorithm for the evolution of a wavepacket in first quantization and exploit the potential quantum advantage of mapping its spatial grid representation to logarithmically many qubits. For the second demonstration, we move to the second quantization framework and review the scaling properties of two alternative time-evolution algorithms, namely, a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) (based on the McLachlan variational principle) and conventional Trotter-type evolution (based on a Lie\textendash Trotter\textendash Suzuki formula). Both methods clearly demonstrate the potential of quantum algorithms and their favorable scaling compared to the available classical approaches. However, a clear demonstration of quantum advantage in the context of molecular quantum dynamics may require the implementation of these algorithms in fault-tolerant quantum computers, while their application in near-term, noisy quantum devices is still unclear and deserves further investigation.},

In this Letter, we propose a quantum algorithm for the simulation of fast nonadiabatic chemical processes together with an initialization scheme for quantum hardware calculations. In particular, we introduce a first-quantization method for the time evolution of a wave packet on two coupled harmonic potential energy surfaces (Marcus model). In our approach, the computational resources scale polynomially in the system dimensions, opening up new avenues for the study of photophysical processes that are classically intractable.},

Here, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for performing quantum dynamics in first quantization. In addition to the usual reduction in circuit depth conferred by variational approaches, this algorithm also enjoys several advantages compared to previously proposed ones. For instance, variational approaches suffer from the need for a large number of measurements. However, the grid encoding of first quantized Hamiltonians only requires measuring in position and momentum bases, irrespective of the system size. Their combination with variational approaches is therefore particularly attractive. Moreover, heuristic variational forms can be employed to overcome the limitation of the hard decomposition of Trotterized first quantized Hamiltonians into quantum gates. We apply this quantum algorithm to the dynamics of several systems in one and two dimensions. Our simulations exhibit the previously observed numerical instabilities of variational time propagation approaches. We show how they can be significantly attenuated through subspace diagonalization at a cost of an additional \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(MN\^2)\$ 2-qubit gates where \$M\$ is the number of dimensions and \$N\^M\$ is the total number of grid points.},

However, classical implementations of analytical derivative theory take advantage of explicit computational access to the approximate electronic wavefunctions in question, which is not possible for the emerging case of hybrid quantum/classical methods. Here, we develop an efficient Lagrangian-based approach for analytical first derivatives of hybrid quantum/classical methods using only observable quantities from the quantum portion of the algorithm. Specifically, we construct the key first-derivative property of the nuclear energy gradient for the recently-developed multistate, contracted variant of the variational quantum eigensolver (MC-VQE) within the context of the ab initio exciton model (AIEM). We show that a clean separation between the quantum and classical parts of the problem is enabled by the definition of an appropriate set of relaxed density matrices, and show how the wavefunction response equations in the quantum part of the algorithm (coupled-perturbed MC-VQE or CP-MC-VQE equations) are decoupled from the wavefunction response equations and and gradient perturbations in the classical part of the algorithm. We explore the magnitudes of the Hellmann-Feynman and response contributions to the gradients in quantum circuit simulations of MC-VQE+AIEM and demonstrate a quantum circuit simulator implementation of adiabatic excited state dynamics with MC-VQE+AIEM.},

  abstract = {Quantum annealing has the potential to provide a speedup over classical algorithms in solving optimization problems. Just as for any other quantum device, suppressing Hamiltonian control errors will be necessary before quantum annealers can achieve speedups. Such analog control errors are known to lead to \$\$J\$\$-chaos, wherein the probability of obtaining the optimal solution, encoded as the ground state of the intended Hamiltonian, varies widely depending on the control error. Here, we show that \$\$J\$\$-chaos causes a catastrophic failure of quantum annealing, in that the scaling of the time-to-solution metric becomes worse than that of a deterministic (exhaustive) classical solver. We demonstrate this empirically using random Ising spin glass problems run on the two latest generations of the D-Wave quantum annealers. We then proceed to show that this doomsday scenario can be mitigated using a simple error suppression and correction scheme known as quantum annealing correction (QAC). By using QAC, the time-to-solution scaling of the same D-Wave devices is improved to below that of the classical upper bound, thus restoring hope in the speedup prospects of quantum annealing.},

The molecular model consisting of two electronic states and the reaction coordinate was coupled to a single cavity mode via the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian, and the corresponding time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation starting with a purely molecular excitation was solved using the Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree Method (MCTDH). We show that, for single-molecule strong coupling with the photon mode, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics produces mixing of polariton manifolds with differing number of excitations, without the need of counter-rotating light\textendash matter coupling terms. Therefore, an electronic excitation of the molecule at the cis configuration is followed by the generation of two photons in the trans configuration upon isomerization. Conditions for this phenomenon to be operating in the collective strong light\textendash matter coupling regime are discussed and found to be unfeasible for the present system, based on simulations of two molecules inside the microcavity. Yet, our finding suggests a new mechanism that, without ultrastrong coupling, achieves photon down-conversion by exploiting the emergent molecular dynamics arising in polaritonic architectures.},

We analyze a U(1) lattice gauge theory in (1+1) dimensions in the presence of dynamical matter for different mass and electric field couplings, a theory akin to quantum-electrodynamics in one-dimension, which displays string-breaking: the confining string between charges can spontaneously break during quench experiments, giving rise to charge-anticharge pairs according to the Schwinger mechanism. We study the real-time spreading of excitations in the system by means of electric field and particle fluctuations: we determine a dynamical state diagram for string breaking and quantitatively evaluate the time-scales for mass production. We also show that the time evolution of the quantum correlations can be detected via bipartite von Neumann entropies, thus demonstrating that the Schwinger mechanism is tightly linked to entanglement spreading. To present the variety of possible applications of this simulation platform, we show how one could follow the real-time scattering processes between mesons and the creation of entanglement during scattering processes. Finally, we test the quality of quantum simulations of these dynamics, quantifying the role of possible imperfections in cold atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuit systems. Our results demonstrate how entanglement properties can be used to deepen our understanding of basic phenomena in the real-time dynamics of gauge theories such as string breaking and collisions.},

In this paper we report on implementations of quantum compression algorithm that can efficiently compress unknown quantum information. We restricted ourselves to compression of three pure qubits into two qubits, as the complexity of even such a simple implementation is barely within the reach of today's quantum processors. We implemented the algorithm on IBM quantum processors with two different topological layouts\textemdash a fully connected triangle processor and a partially connected line processor. It turns out that the incomplete connectivity of the line processor affects the performance only minimally. On the other hand, it turns out that the transpilation, i.e. compilation of the circuit into gates physically available to the quantum processor, crucially influences the result. We also have seen that the compression followed by immediate decompression is, even for such a simple case, on the edge or even beyond the capabilities of currently available quantum processors.},

  abstract = {In recent years, tensor computation has become a promising tool for solving big data analysis, machine learning, medical image, and EDA problems. To ease the memory and computation intensity of tensor processing, decomposition techniques, especially tensor-train decomposition (TTD), are widely adopted to compress the extremely high-dimensional tensor data. Despite TTD's potential to break the curse of dimensionality, researchers have not yet leveraged its full computational potential, mainly because of two reasons: 1) executing TTD itself is time- and energy-consuming due to the singular value decomposition (SVD) operation inside each of TTD's iteration and 2) additional software/hardware optimizations are often required to process the obtained TT-format data in certain applications such as deep learning inference. In this article, we address these challenges with two approaches. First, we propose an algorithm-hardware co-design with customized architecture, namely, TTD Engine to accelerate TTD. We use MRI image compression as a demo application to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed accelerator. Second, we present a case study demonstrating the benefit of TT-format data processing and the efficacy of using TTD Engine. In the case study, we use the TT approach to realize convolution operation, which is difficult and nontrivial for TT-format data. Experimental results show that, TTD Engine achieves, on average, \$14.9 \textbackslash times \$ \textendash{} \$36.9 \textbackslash times \$ speedup over CPU implementations and \$4.1\textbackslash times \$ \textendash{} \$9.9\textbackslash times \$ speedup compared to the GPU baseline. The energy efficiency is also improved by at least \$14.4\textbackslash times \$ and \$5.4\textbackslash times \$ over CPU and GPU, respectively. Moreover, our hardware-enabled TT-format data processing further leads to more efficient implementations of complicated operations and applications.},

The usefulness of such near-term techniques, generally based on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), however, is limited by device noise and the need to perform many circuit repetitions. This paper addresses these challenges by generalizing VQE to consider wavefunctions in a subspace spanned by classically tractable states and states that can be prepared on a quantum computer. The manuscript shows how the ground and excited state energies can be estimated using such "classical-boosting" and how this approach can be combined with VQE Hamiltonian decomposition techniques. Unlike existing VQE approaches, the sensitivity to sampling error and device noise approaches zero in the limit where the classically tractable states are able to describe an eigenstate. A detailed analysis of the measurement requirements in the simplest case, where a single computational basis state is used to boost conventional VQE, shows that the ground-state energy estimation of several closed-shell homonuclear diatomic molecules can be accelerated by a factor of approximately 10-1000. The analysis also shows that the measurement reduction of such single basis state boosting, relative to conventional VQE, can be estimated using only the overlap between the ground state and the computational basis state used for boosting.},

In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier\textendash Stokes, Schr\"odinger, Kuramoto\textendash Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.},

  abstract = {In this work we propose a novel numerical approach to decompose general quantum programs in terms of single- and two-qubit quantum gates with a \$CNOT\$ gate count very close to the current theoretical lower bounds. In particular, it turns out that \$15\$ and \$63\$ \$CNOT\$ gates are sufficient to decompose a general \$3\$- and \$4\$-qubit unitary, respectively. This is currently the lowest achieved gate count compared to other algorithms. Our approach is based on a sequential optimization of parameters related to the single-qubit rotation gates involved in a pre-designed quantum circuit used for the decomposition. In addition, the algorithm can be adopted to sparse inter-qubit connectivity architectures provided by current mid-scale quantum computers, needing only a few additional \$CNOT\$ gates to be implemented in the resulting quantum circuits.},

The utilization of these parametric two-qubit gates in the circuit design allows us to transform the discrete combinatorial problem of circuit synthesis into an optimization problem over continuous variables. The circuit is then compressed by a sequential removal of two-qubit gates from the design, while the remaining building blocks are continuously adapted to the reduced gate structure by iterated learning cycles. We implemented the developed algorithm in the SQUANDER software package and benchmarked it against several state-of-the-art quantum gate synthesis tools.

  abstract = {This work tackles the problem of finding a good ansatz initialization for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), by proposing CAFQA, a Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy. The CAFQA ansatz is a hardware-efficient circuit built with only Clifford gates. In this ansatz, the parameters for the tunable gates are chosen by searching efficiently through the Clifford parameter space via classical simulation. The resulting initial states always equal or outperform traditional classical initialization (e.g., Hartree-Fock), and enable high-accuracy VQA estimations. CAFQA is well-suited to classical computation because: a) Clifford-only quantum circuits can be exactly simulated classically in polynomial time, and b) the discrete Clifford space is searched efficiently via Bayesian Optimization. For the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) task of molecular ground state energy estimation (up to 18 qubits), CAFQA's Clifford Ansatz achieves a mean accuracy of nearly 99\% and recovers as much as 99.99\% of the molecular correlation energy that is lost in Hartree-Fock initialization. CAFQA achieves mean accuracy improvements of 6.4x and 56.8x, over the state-of-the-art, on different metrics. The scalability of the approach allows for preliminary ground state energy estimation of the challenging chromium dimer (Cr\$\_2\$) molecule. With CAFQA's high-accuracy initialization, the convergence of VQAs is shown to accelerate by 2.5x, even for small molecules. Furthermore, preliminary exploration of allowing a limited number of non-Clifford (T) gates in the CAFQA framework, shows that as much as 99.9\% of the correlation energy can be recovered at bond lengths for which Clifford-only CAFQA accuracy is relatively limited, while remaining classically simulable.},

  abstract = {Complex numbers, i.e., numbers with a real and an imaginary part, are essential for mathematical analysis, while their role in other subjects, such as electromagnetism or special relativity, is far less fundamental. Quantum physics is the only physical theory where these numbers seem to play an indispensible role, as the theory is explicitly formulated in terms of operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces. The occurrence of complex numbers within the quantum formalism has nonetheless puzzled countless physicists, including the fathers of the theory, for whom a real version of quantum physics, where states and observables are represented by real operators, seemed much more natural. In fact, previous works showed that such "real quantum physics" can reproduce the outcomes of any multipartite experiment, as long as the parts share arbitrary real quantum states. Thus, are complex numbers really needed for a quantum description of nature? Here, we show this to be case by proving that real and complex quantum physics make different predictions in network scenarios comprising independent quantum state sources. This allows us to devise a Bell-type quantum experiment whose input-output correlations cannot be approximated by any real quantum model. The successful realization of such an experiment would disprove real quantum physics, in the same way as standard Bell experiments disproved local physics.},

In recent years, time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) has emerged as a general, numerically accurate and efficient method for high-dimensional full-quantum dynamics. This review will cover the fundamental algorithms of TD-DMRG in the modern framework of matrix product states (MPS) and matrix product operators (MPO), including the basic algebra with respect to MPS and MPO, the novel time evolution schemes to propagate MPS, and the automated MPO construction algorithm to encode generic Hamiltonian. Most importantly, the proposed method can handle the mixed state density matrix at finite temperature, enabling quantum statistical description for molecular aggregates. We demonstrate the performance of TD-DMRG by benchmarking with the current state-of-the-art methods for simulating quantum dynamics of the spin-boson model and the Frenkel\textendash Holstein(\textendash Peierls) model. As applications of TD-DMRG to real-world problems, we present theoretical investigations of carrier mobility and spectral function of rubrene crystal, and the radiationless decay rate of azulene with an anharmonic potential energy surface.

Reflecting this broad range of applications, an enormously versatile set of experiments are now regularly used to interrogate light-driven chemical dynamics, ranging from the typical ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy used in many university laboratories to the inspiring central facilities around the world, such as the next-generation of X-ray free-electron lasers.Computer simulations of light-driven molecular and material dynamics are an essential route to analyzing the enormous amount of transient electronic and structural data produced by these experimental sources. However, to date, the direct simulation of molecular photochemistry remains a frontier challenge in computational chemical science, simultaneously demanding the accurate treatment of molecular electronic structure, nuclear dynamics, and the impact of nonadiabatic couplings.To address these important challenges and to enable new computational methods which can be integrated with state-of-the-art experimental capabilities, the past few years have seen a burst of activity in the development of ``direct'' quantum dynamics methods, merging the machine learning of potential energy surfaces (PESs) and nonadiabatic couplings with accurate quantum propagation schemes such as the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method. The result of this approach is a new generation of direct quantum dynamics tools in which PESs are generated in tandem with wave function propagation, enabling accurate ``on-the-fly'' simulations of molecular photochemistry. These simulations offer an alternative route toward gaining quantum dynamics insights, circumventing the challenge of generating ab initio electronic structure data for PES fitting by instead only demanding expensive energy evaluations as and when they are needed.In this Account, we describe the chronological evolution of our own contributions to this field, focusing on describing the algorithmic developments that enable direct MCTDH simulations for complex molecular systems moving on multiple coupled electronic states. Specifically, we highlight active learning strategies for generating PESs during grid-based quantum chemical dynamics simulations, and we discuss the development and impact of novel diabatization schemes to enable direct grid-based simulations of photochemical dynamics; these developments are highlighted in a series of benchmark molecular simulations of systems containing multiple nuclear degrees of freedom moving on multiple coupled electronic states. We hope that the ongoing developments reported here represent a major step forward in tools for modeling excited-state chemistry such as photodissociation, proton and electron transfer, and ultrafast energy dissipation in complex molecular systems.},

  abstract = {Quantum data is susceptible to decoherence induced by the environment and to errors in the hardware processing it. A future fault-tolerant quantum computer will use quantum error correction (QEC) to actively protect against both. In the smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a two-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits. For each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed stabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing the encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using nuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and NV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at the end of a QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable to physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for fault tolerance. Using a five-qubit superconducting processor, we realize the two parity measurements comprising the stabilizers of the three-qubit repetition code protecting one logical qubit from physical bit-flip errors. We construct these stabilizers as parallelized indirect measurements using ancillary qubits, and evidence their non-demolition character by generating three-qubit entanglement from superposition states. We demonstrate stabilizer-based quantum error detection (QED) by subjecting a logical qubit to coherent and incoherent bit-flip errors on its constituent physical qubits. While increased physical qubit coherence times and shorter QED blocks are required to actively safeguard quantum information, this demonstration is a critical step toward larger codes based on multiple parity measurements.},

CPC codes have a canonical structure involving successive rounds of bit and phase parity checks, supplemented by cross-checks to fix the code distance. In this paper, we provide a detailed introduction to CPC codes using conventional quantum circuit notation. We demonstrate the implementation of a CPC code on real hardware, by designing a [[4, 2, 2]] detection code for the IBM 5Q superconducting qubit device. Whilst the individual gate-error rates on the IBM device are too high to realise a fault tolerant quantum detection code, our results show that the syndrome information from a full encode-decode cycle of the [[4, 2, 2]] CPC code can be used to increase the output state fidelity by post-selection. Following this, we generalise CPC codes to other quantum technologies by showing that their structure allows them to be efficiently compiled using any experimentally realistic native two-qubit gate. We introduce a three-stage CPC design process for the construction of hardware-optimised quantum memories. As a proof-of-concept example, we apply our design process to an idealised linear seven-qubit ion trap. In the first stage of the process, we use exhaustive search methods to find a large set of [[7, 3, 3]] codes that saturate the quantum Hamming bound for seven qubits. We then optimise over the discovered set of codes to meet the hardware and layout demands of the ion trap device. We also discuss how the CPC design process will generalise to larger-scale codes and other qubit technologies.},

We illustrate our methodology with numerical simulations for a system of four hydrogen atoms that exhibit strong correlation and show that the circuit depth of VQE using a UCC ansatz can be reduced without introducing significant loss of accuracy in the final wavefunctions and energies.},

This progress is due to the growth in computational power allied with the development of new methodologies that allow the treatment of electrons and nuclei as quantum particles. In the realm of materials science, where the quest for desirable emergent properties relies increasingly on soft weakly-bonded materials, such methods have become indispensable. In this perspective, an overview of simulation methods that are applicable for large system sizes and that can capture the quantum nature of electrons and nuclei in the adiabatic approximation is given. In addition, the remaining challenges are discussed, especially regarding the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects (NQE) beyond a harmonic or perturbative treatment, the impact of NQE on electronic properties of weakly-bonded systems, and how different first-principles potential energy surfaces can change the impact of NQE on the atomic structure and dynamics of weakly bonded systems.},

These have the potential to target chemical systems intractable by the most powerful classical computers. However, the resources offered by contemporary quantum computers are still limited, restricting the chemical simulations to very simple molecules. In order to rapidly scale up to more interesting molecular systems, we propose the embedding of the quantum electronic structure calculation into a classically computed environment obtained at the Hartree-Fock (HF) or Density Functional Theory (DFT) level of theory. We achieve this by constructing an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates a mean field potential describing the action of the inactive electrons on a selected Active Space (AS). The ground state of the AS Hamiltonian is determined by means of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. With the proposed iterative DFT embedding scheme we are able to obtain energy correction terms for a single pyridine molecule that outperform the Complete Active Space Self Consistent Field (CASSCF) results regardless of the chosen AS.},

Their deep understanding thus represents a mandatory scientific goal. Moreover, controlling the separation of photogenerated charges is a crucial prerequisite in many applicative contexts, including quantum electronics, photo-electrochemical water splitting, photocatalytic dye degradation, and energy conversion. In particular, photoinduced charge separation is the pivotal step driving the storage of sun light into electrical or chemical energy. If properly mastered, these processes may also allow us to achieve a better command of information storage at the nanoscale, as required for the development of molecular electronics, optical switching, or quantum technologies, amongst others. In this Topical Review we survey recent progress in the understanding of ultrafast charge separation from photoexcited states. We report the state-of-the-art of the observation and theoretical description of charge separation phenomena in the ultrafast regime mainly focusing on molecular- and nano-sized solar energy conversion systems. In particular, we examine different proposed mechanisms driving ultrafast charge dynamics, with particular regard to the role of quantum coherence and electron-nuclear coupling, and link experimental observations to theoretical approaches based either on model Hamiltonians or on first principles simulations.},

  abstract = {Energy transfer in terms of excitation or charge is one of the most basic processes in nature, and understanding and controlling them is one of the major challenges of modern quantum chemistry. In this work, we highlight that these processes as well as other chemical properties can be drastically altered by modifying the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in a cavity. By using a real-space formulation from first principles that keeps all of the electronic degrees of freedom in the model explicit and simulates changes in the environment by an effective photon mode, we can easily connect to well-known quantum-chemical results such as Dexter charge-transfer and F\"orster excitation-transfer reactions, taking into account the often-disregarded Coulomb and self-polarization interaction. We find that the photonic degrees of freedom introduce extra electron\textendash electron correlations over large distances and that the coupling to the cavity can drastically alter the characteristic charge-transfer behavior and even selectively improve the efficiency. For excitation transfer, we find that the cavity renders the transfer more efficient, essentially distance-independent, and further different configurations of highest efficiency depending on the coherence times. For strong decoherence (short coherence times), the cavity frequency should be in between the isolated excitations of the donor and acceptor, while for weak decoherence (long coherence times), the cavity should enhance a mode that is close to resonance with either donor or acceptor. Our results highlight that changing the photonic environment can redefine chemical processes, rendering polaritonic chemistry a promising approach toward the control of chemical reactions.},

By repeating simple data-encoding gates multiple times, quantum models can access increasingly rich frequency spectra. We show that there exist quantum models which can realize all possible sets of Fourier coefficients, and therefore, if the accessible frequency spectrum is asymptotically rich enough, such models are universal function approximators.},

  abstract = {A theorem is proven for quantum information theory that is analogous to the noiseless coding theorem of classical information theory. In the quantum result, the von Neumann entropy S of the density operator describing an ensemble of pure quantum signal states is equal to the number of spin-systems ("quantum bits" or "qubits") necessary to represent the signal faithfully. The theorem holds whether or not the signal states are orthogonal. Related results are also presented about the 6delity of quantum coding and about representing entangled quantum states. PACS number(s): 03.65.Bz, 05.30.-d, 89.70.+c I. ENTROPY AND INFORMATION In the classical information theory developed by Shan-non and others, the central problem is coding [I]. For example , suppose that A is a message source that produces the message a with probability p (a), and further suppose that we wish to represent the messages with sequences of binary digits (bits) that are as short as possible. It can be shown that the mean length L of these bit sequences is bounded below by the Shannon entropy H(A) of the source: L)H(A), where can be interpreted as the number of bits that would be required to specify the microstate of the system. (Of course, in classical statistical mechanics the phase space of states is a continuum, so that the number of bits needed to specify a microstate comp/etely is infinite. This can be avoided in the usual way by specifying the microstate to a finite, and arbitrary, resolution in phase space.) In quantum systems, however, the expression for en-tropy (first proposed by von Neumann [3]) is not identical to the Shannon entropy. Suppose p is the density operator describing an ensemble of states of a quantum system; then the von Neumann entropy S(p) is H (A) =-g p (a)log2p (a). S(p)=-Trp log2p. (2) (Throughout this paper, we use base-2 logarithms.) Furthermore , if we allow ourselves to code entire blocks of independent messages together,-it turns out that the mean number L of bits per message can be brought arbitrarily close to H (A). This noiseless coding theorem shows the importance of the Shannon entropy H(2) for information theory. It also provides an interpretation of H (2) as the mean number of bits necessary to code the output of A using an ideal code. We might imagine that each bit has a fixed "cost" (in units of energy or space or money), so that H (A) is a measure of the tangible resources necessary to represent the information produced by A. The "entropy" is also of central importance in statistical mechanics, where it is a measure of the disorder of a physical system. In classical statistical mechanics, in fact, the statistical entropy is formally identically to the Shannon entropy. This has led to a considerable efFort to give statistical mechanics an information-theoretic foundation [2]. In this approach, the entropy of a macrostate 'Electronic address: schumacb@kenyon. edu This has obvious analogies to the Shannon entropy; in fact, if we can interpret the probabilities p (a) in Eq. (I) as eigenvalues of the density operator p, then S(p) is numerically equal to H (A). Despite their formal similarity, however, these two quantities are quite difFerent. We can see this difFerence easily by considering a quantum signal source, which might be part of a quantum communication system. This is a device that codes each message a from the source A into a "signal state" \textasciitilde aM) of a quantum system M. Then the ensemble of signals from the signal source will be represented by the density operator p= gp(a)m, , where the density operators m. , are the projections m, = \textasciitilde{} a\textasciitilde ) (aM \textasciitilde. The von Neumann entropy of p will equal the Shannon entropy of the message source only in the special case when the signals \textasciitilde a\textasciitilde ) are orthogonal to one another, in which case the signal states are eigen-states of p. If the signals are not orthogonal, then S(p) (H(A), and the eigenstates of p may have no simple relation to the signal states [4]. Of course, if the signal states are not orthogonal it will not be possible to distinguish between them perfectly. In},

The former are designed to capture, harvest, efficiently transport, and transform energy from sunlight for photosynthesis, while the latter should dissipate the absorbed radiation as quickly as possible to prevent photodamages and corruption of the carried genetic information. Because of the unique electronic and structural characteristics, the modeling of their photoinduced activity is a real challenge. Numerous approaches have been devised building on the theoretical development achieved for single chromophores and on model Hamiltonians that capture the essential features of the system. Still, a question remains: is a general strategy for the accurate modeling of multichromophoric systems possible? By using a quantum chemical point of view, here we review the advancements developed so far highlighting differences and similarities with the single chromophore treatment. Finally, we outline the important limitations and challenges that still need to be tackled to reach a complete and accurate picture of their photoinduced properties and dynamics.},

In order to simulate indistinguishable fermionic particles, it is first required to map the fermionic state to the state of the qubits. The Bravyi-Kitaev Superfast (BKSF) algorithm can be used to accomplish this mapping. The BKSF mapping has connections to quantum error correction and opens the door to new ways of understanding fermionic simulation in a topological context. Here, we present the first detailed exposition of the BKSF algorithm for molecular simulation. We provide the BKSF transformed qubit operators and report on our implementation of the BKSF fermion-to-qubits transform in OpenFermion. In this initial study of a hydrogen molecule we have compared BKSF, Jordan-Wigner, and Bravyi-Kitaev transforms under the Trotter approximation. The gate count to implement BKSF is lower than Jordan-Wigner but higher than Bravyi-Kitaev. We considered different orderings of the exponentiated terms and found lower Tr...},

Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis}

Even zero-temperature equilibrium phases of matter and the transitions between them have yet to be fully classified, with topologically protected phases presenting major difficulties. We construct and measure a continuously parametrized family of states crossing a symmetry protected topological phase transition on the IBM Q quantum computers. The simulation that we perform is easily scalable and is a practical demonstration of the utility of near-term quantum computers for the study of quantum phases of matter and their transitions.},

However, the quality of this procedure relies on the availability of rigorous electronic structure calculations. The development of quantum processors has shown great potential for the efficient evaluation of accurate ground and excited state energies of molecular systems, opening up new avenues for molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we address the use of variational quantum algorithms for the calculation of accurate atomic forces to be used in AIMD. In particular, we provide solutions for the alleviation of the statistical noise associated with the measurements of the expectation values of energies and forces, as well as schemes for the mitigation of the hardware noise sources (in particular, gate infidelities, qubit decoherence, and readout errors). Despite the relative large error in the calculation of the potential energy, our results show that the proposed algorithms can provide accurate MD trajectories in the microcanonical (constant energy) ensemble. Furthermore, exploiting the intrinsic noise associated to the quantum measurement process, we also propose a Langevin dynamics algorithm for the simulation of canonical, i.e., constant temperature, dynamics. Both algorithms (microcanonical and canonical) are applied to the simulation of simple molecular systems such as H2 and H+3. Finally, we also provide results for the dynamics of H2 obtained with IBM quantum computer ibmq\_athens.},

We report an implementation of the fewest-switches surface-hopping algorithm in the NWChem computational chemistry program. The surface-hopping method is combined with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory calculations of adiabatic excited-state potential energy surfaces. To treat quantum transitions between arbitrary electronic Born\textendash Oppenheimer states, we have implemented both numerical and analytical differentiation schemes for derivative nonadiabatic couplings. A numerical approach for the time-derivative nonadiabatic couplings together with an analytical method for calculating nonadiabatic coupling vectors is an efficient combination for surface-hopping approaches. Additionally, electronic decoherence schemes and a state reassigned unavoided crossings algorithm are implemented to improve the accuracy of the simulated dynamics and to handle trivial unavoided crossings. We apply our code to study the ultrafast decay of photoexcited benzene, including a detailed analysis of the potential energy surface, population decay timescales, and vibrational coordinates coupled to the excitation dynamics. We also study the photoinduced dynamics in trans-distyrylbenzene. This study provides a baseline for future implementations of higher-level frameworks for simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics in NWChem.},

However, accurately representing the Fermi-Hubbard ground state for large instances may be beyond the reach of near-term quantum hardware. Here we show experimentally that an efficient, low-depth variational quantum algorithm with few parameters can reproduce important qualitative features of medium-size instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model. We address 1x8 and 2x4 instances on 16 qubits on a superconducting quantum processor, substantially larger than previous work based on less scalable compression techniques, and going beyond the family of 1D Fermi-Hubbard instances, which are solvable classically. Consistent with predictions for the ground state, we observe the onset of the metal-insulator transition and Friedel oscillations in 1D, and antiferromagnetic order in both 1D and 2D. We use a variety of error-mitigation techniques, including symmetries of the Fermi-Hubbard model and a recently developed technique tailored to simulating fermionic systems. We also introduce a new variational optimisation algorithm based on iterative Bayesian updates of a local surrogate model. Our scalable approach is a first step to using near-term quantum computers to determine low-energy properties of strongly-correlated electronic systems that cannot be solved exactly by classical computers.},

  abstract = {Quantum information theorists have created axiomatic reconstructions of quantum mechanics (QM) that are very successful at identifying precisely what distinguishes quantum probability theory from classical and more general probability theories in terms of information-theoretic principles. Herein, we show how two such principles, i.e., "Existence of an Information Unit" and "Continuous Reversibility," map to the relativity principle as it pertains to the invariant measurement of Planck's constant h for Stern-Gerlach (SG) spin measurements in spacetime in exact analogy to the relativity principle as it pertains to the invariant measurement of the speed of light c for special relativity (SR). Essentially, quantum information theorists have extended Einstein's use of the relativity principle from the boost invariance of measurements of c to include the SO(3) invariance of measurements of h between different reference frames of mutually complementary spin measurements via the principle of "Information Invariance \& Continuity." Consequently, the "average-only" conservation represented by the Bell states that is responsible for the Tsirelson bound and the exclusion of the no-signalling, "superquantum" Popescu-Rohrlich joint probabilities is understood to result from conservation per Information Invariance \& Continuity between different reference frames of mutually complementary measurements, and this maps to conservation per the relativity principle in spacetime. Thus, the axiomatic reconstructions of QM have succeeded in producing a principle account of QM that is every bit as robust as the postulates of SR, revealing a still broader role for the relativity principle in the foundations of physics.},

In the QPEA-based full-CI on QCs, the preparation of the initial guess wave functions having large overlap with the full-CI root is crucial. Recently, we proposed a quantum circuit to prepare spin symmetry-adapted configuration state functions (CSFs) toward open shell electronic structure calculations of molecules on QCs. Here, we propose an improved quantum circuit, based on Serber construction of spin eigenfunctions, enabling us to prepare CSFs with much less and easier-to-implement quantum gates than the previously proposed one.}

Here, we propose a quantum algorithm to construct the wave function consisting of one configuration state function, which is suitable for the initial guess wave function in QPE-based FCI calculations of open-shell molecules, based on the addition theorem of angular momentum.

Meanwhile, quantum error mitigation (QEM) was recently introduced for suppressing errors in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices; it improves the computation accuracy of near-term quantum algorithms with its overhead being a greater number of samples. In this work, we integrate QEC and QEM into an efficient FTQC architecture that effectively increases the code distance and \$T\$-gate count. Our scheme will dramatically alleviate the required qubit count by tens of percent at the cost of a constant multiplicative sampling overhead within \$10\^2\$ in a wide range of regimes from the post-NISQ era to early FTQC regime, which necessitates the order of from \$10\^4\$ to \$10\^\{10\}\$ logical operations. While it has been widely believed that there do not exist useful applications in post-NISQ regimes due to a chasm between the NISQ and FTQC regimes such as overheads for encoding and \$T\$-gate distillations, our scheme can continuously bridge the two distinct regimes.},

This motivated the development of various quantum error mitigation protocols, each representing a method to extract useful computational output by combining measurement data from multiple samplings of the available imperfect quantum device. What are the ultimate performance limits universally imposed on such protocols? Here, we derive a fundamental bound on the sampling overhead that applies to a general class of error mitigation protocols, assuming only the laws of quantum mechanics. We use it to show that (1) the sampling overhead to mitigate local depolarizing noise for layered circuits -- such as the ones used for variational quantum algorithms -- must scale exponentially with circuit depth, and (2) the optimality of probabilistic error cancellation method among all strategies in mitigating a certain class of noise. We discuss how our unified framework and general bounds can be employed to benchmark and compare various present methods of error mitigation and suggest the significance of pre-knowledge in mitigating noise.},

Here we propose an extension of the VQE to calculate the nonadiabatic couplings of molecules in quantum chemical systems and Berry's phase in quantum many-body systems. Both quantities play an important role in understanding the properties of a system beyond the naive adiabatic picture, e.g., nonadiabatic dynamics and topological phase of matter. We provide quantum circuits and classical postprocessings to calculate the nonadiabatic couplings and Berry's phase. Specifically, we show that the evaluation of the nonadiabatic couplings reduces to that of expectation values of observables while that of Berry's phase also requires one additional Hadamard test. Furthermore, we simulate the photodissociation dynamics of a lithium fluoride molecule using the nonadiabatic couplings evaluated on a real quantum device. Our proposal widens the applicability of the VQE and the possibility of near-term quantum devices to study molecules and quantum many-body systems.},

Compared to the well-known quantum algorithms requiring QEC, like Shor's or Grover's algorithm, NISQ applications have different structures and properties to exploit in compilation. A key step in compilation is mapping the qubits in the program to physical qubits on a given quantum computer, which has been shown to be an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we present OLSQ-GA, an optimal qubit mapper with a key feature of simultaneous SWAP gate absorption during qubit mapping, which we show to be a very effective optimization technique for NISQ applications. For the class of quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), an important NISQ application, OLSQ-GA reduces depth by up to 50.0\% and SWAP count by 100\% compared to other state-of-the-art methods, which translates to 55.9\% fidelity improvement. The solution optimality of OLSQ-GA is achieved by the exact SMT formulation. For better scalability, we augment our approach with additional constraints in the form of initial mapping or alternating matching, which speeds up OLSQ-GA by up to 272X with no or little loss of optimality.},

However, upon adjoining a non-trivial machine system (or ancilla) one finds that, pace the quantum case, the obstruction to cloning disappears for pure states.

Decoherence and gate errors lead to wrong estimates of the expectation values of observables used to evaluate the noisy circuit. The two schemes we discuss are deliberately simple and don't require additional qubit resources, so to be as practically relevant in current experiments as possible. The first method, extrapolation to the zero noise limit, subsequently cancels powers of the noise perturbations by an application of Richardson's deferred approach to the limit. The second method cancels errors by resampling randomized circuits according to a quasi-probability distribution.},

In quantum mechanics, measurement-induced disturbance is largest for complementary properties and, hence, limits the precision with which such properties can be determined simultaneously. It is tempting to try to sidestep this disturbance by copying the system and measuring each complementary property on a separate copy. However, perfect copying is physically impossible in quantum mechanics. Here, we investigate using the closest quantum analog to this copying strategy, optimal cloning. The coherent portion of the generated clones' state corresponds to "twins" of the input system. Like perfect copies, both twins faithfully reproduce the properties of the input system. Unlike perfect copies, the twins are entangled. As such, a measurement on both twins is equivalent to a simultaneous measurement on the input system. For complementary observables, this joint measurement gives the system's state, just as in the classical case. We demonstrate this experimentally using polarized single photons.},

We propose a new method to embed discrete features with trainable quantum circuits by combining QRAC and a recently proposed strategy for training quantum feature map called quantum metric learning.

  abstract = {Quantum chemistry provides a target for quantum simulation of considerable scientific interest and industrial importance. The majority of algorithms to date have been based on a second-quantized representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian - necessitating qubit requirements that scale linearly with the number of orbitals. The scaling of the number of gates for such methods, while polynomial, presents some serious experimental challenges. However, because the number of electrons is a good quantum number for the electronic structure problem it is unnecessary to store the full Fock space of the orbitals. Representation of the wave function in a basis of Slater determinants for fixed electron number suffices. However, to date techniques for the quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian represented in this basis - the CI-matrix - have been lacking. We show how to apply techniques developed for the simulation of sparse Hamiltonians to the CI-matrix. We prove a number of results exploiting the structure of the CI-matrix, arising from the Slater rules which define it, to improve the application of sparse Hamiltonian simulation techniques in this case. We show that it is possible to use the minimal number of qubits to represent the wavefunction, and that these methods can offer improved scaling in the number of gates required in the limit of fixed electron number and increasing basis set size relevant for high-accuracy calculations. We hope these results open the door to further investigation of sparse Hamiltonian simulation techniques in the context of the quantum simulation of quantum chemistry.},

In this work we investigate this issue in several systems of interest, including organic molecules, transition metal complexes, the uniform electron gas, Hubbard models, and quantum impurity models arising from embedding formalisms such as dynamical mean-field theory. Our approach uses a state-of-the-art classical technique for high-fidelity ground state approximation. We find that easy-to-prepare single Slater determinants such as the Hartree-Fock state often have surprisingly robust support on the ground state for many applications of interest. For the most difficult systems, single-determinant reference states may be insufficient, but low-complexity reference states may suffice. For this we introduce a method for preparation of multi-determinant states on quantum computers.},

Here we apply extremely sensitive femtosecond optical Kerr-effect spectroscopy to study the depolarized Raman spectra of lysozyme and its complex with the inhibitor triacetylchitotriose in solution. Underdamped delocalized vibrational modes in the terahertz frequency domain are identified and shown to blue-shift and strengthen upon inhibitor binding. This demonstrates that the ligand-binding coordinate in proteins is underdamped and not simply solvent-controlled as previously assumed. The presence of such underdamped delocalized modes in proteins may have significant implications for the understanding of the efficiency of ligand binding and protein\textendash molecule interactions, and has wider implications for biochemical reactivity and biological function.},

Experimental realizations have been reported in recent years and theoretical estimates of its efficiency are a subject of intense effort. Here we consider the performance of the VQE technique for a Hubbard-like model describing a one-dimensional chain of fermions with competing nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. We find that recovering the VQE solution allows one to obtain the correlation function of the ground state consistent with the exact result. We also study the barren plateau phenomenon for the Hamiltonian in question and find that the severity of this effect depends on the encoding of fermions to qubits. Our results are consistent with the current knowledge about the barren plateaus in quantum optimization.},

For 6D HH the overhead of ML-MCTDH makes the method slower than MCTDH, but for 18D HH ML-MCTDH starts to be competitive. We report as well 1458D simulations of the HH Hamiltonian using a seven-layer scheme. The photoabsorption spectrum of pyrazine computed with the 24D Hamiltonian of Raab et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 110, 936 (1999)] provides a realistic molecular test case for the method. Quick and small ML-MCTDH calculations needing a fraction of the time and resources of reference MCTDH calculations provide already spectra with all the correct features. Accepting slightly larger deviations, the calculation can be accelerated to take only 7 min. When pushing the method toward convergence, results of similar quality than the best available MCTDH benchmark, which is based on a wavepacket with 4.6\texttimes 107time-dependent coefficients, are obtained with a much more compact wavefunction consisting of only 4.5\texttimes 105 coefficients and requiring a shorter computation time.}

  abstract = {Solving the electronic structure problem using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) technique involves the measurement of the Hamiltonian expectation value. The current hardware can perform only projective single-qubit measurements, and thus, the Hamiltonian expectation value is obtained by measuring parts of the Hamiltonian rather than the full Hamiltonian. This restriction makes the measurement process inefficient because the number of terms in the Hamiltonian grows as O(N4) with the size of the system, N. To optimize the VQE measurement, one can try to group as many Hamiltonian terms as possible for their simultaneous measurement. Single-qubit measurements allow one to group only the terms commuting within the corresponding single-qubit subspaces or qubit-wise commuting. We found that the qubit-wise commutativity between the Hamiltonian terms can be expressed as a graph and the problem of the optimal grouping is equivalent to finding a minimum clique cover (MCC) for the Hamiltonian graph. The MCC problem is NP-hard, but there exist several polynomial heuristic algorithms to solve it approximately. Several of these heuristics were tested in this work for a set of molecular electronic Hamiltonians. On average, grouping qubit-wise commuting terms reduced the number of operators to measure three times less compared to the total number of terms in the considered Hamiltonians.}

This new paradigm in computer science harnesses quantum entanglement, one striking non-intuitive feature of quantum mechanics and a cornerstone of quantum information, to provide computation with a quantum speed-up over the best-known classical algorithms and to enable encrypted data communication against eavesdropping. The bulk of this article is focused on providing a deep and abiding understanding of non-relativistic matrix mechanics by demonstrating the fundamental mathematical relations of the contemporary postulatory approach of quantum mechanics within the state vector and density operator formalism in multipartite systems. In addition to that, we derive and analyse the respective 1-qubit, 1-qutrit, 2-qubit, and 2-qudit coherent and incoherent density operators using Bloch's parametrization for generalized \$d\$-dimensional \$N\$-qudit states embedded in the \$SU(d)\$ Lie group with associate generalized Gell Mann's matrices spanning the \$\textbackslash mathfrak\{su\}(d)\$ Lie algebra. We also address the fundamental concepts of quantum nondemolition measurements, quantum decoherence and, particularly, quantum entanglement providing for the latter a systematic view on its historical development and mathematical description in multipartite systems. We conclude our review by introducing some of the ubiquitous quantum quantifiers required to measure degrees of quantum entanglement and quantum coherence, deriving the \$p\$-norm quantum coherence measure for a 1-qubit state.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

A natural question is whether noise on NISQ devices places fundamental limitations on VQA performance. We rigorously prove a serious limitation for noisy VQAs, in that the noise causes the training landscape to have a barren plateau (i.e., vanishing gradient). Specifically, for the local Pauli noise considered, we prove that the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits \$n\$ if the depth of the ansatz grows linearly with \$n\$. These noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs) are conceptually different from noise-free barren plateaus, which are linked to random parameter initialization. Our result is formulated for a generic ansatz that includes as special cases the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz and the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz, among others. For the former, our numerical heuristics demonstrate the NIBP phenomenon for a realistic hardware noise model.},

These observations have led to a debate regarding the states that give rise to the coherences and whether the presence of the coherences has implications for photosynthetic light harvesting. In these experiments, laser pulses create a coherent superposition of quantum states with a defined phase relationship across an ensemble, which gives rise to the~quantum coherence and associated quantum beating signal. Dephasing of these quantum coherences, seen as a decay of the beating signal, is among the most sensitive probes of the interactions between a system and its surrounding environment. In this Review, we discuss the~proposed origin and assignment of the observed quantum coherences in photosynthetic systems as electronic, vibronic or vibrational. We describe the latest experimental efforts towards unravelling the nature of the coherences, in particular ultrafast, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, as well as the accompanying theoretical and computational results. We discuss how~measuring coherences can inform us about the excited-state dynamics of biophysical and chemical systems relevant to natural light harvesting and how these measurements reveal electronic structure beyond that captured by simplistic models.Femtosecond spectroscopy of photosynthetic systems reveals long-lived quantum coherences. This Review focuses on efforts to understand the microscopic origins of these signals and discusses how such coherences may be exploited to probe design principles of photosynthetic light harvesting.}

In this paper, we analyze the computational requirements for one of the standard algorithms to perform quantum chemistry on a quantum computer. We focus on the quantum resources required to find the ground state of a molecule twice as large as what current classical computers can solve exactly. We find that while such a problem requires about a ten-fold increase in the number of qubits over current technology, the required increase in the number of gates that can be coherently executed is many orders of magnitude larger. This suggests that for quantum computation to become useful for quantum chemistry problems, drastic algorithmic improvements will be needed.},

Going beyond this paradigm, we then consider a natural generalization of this platform, in which several cavity--qubit pairs are coupled to form a chain. The photonic states thus produced feature a two-dimensional entanglement structure and are readily interpreted as \$\textbackslash textit\{radial plaquette\}\$ projected entangled pair states, which include many paradigmatic states, such as the broad class of isometric tensor network states, graph states, string-net states.},

In this work, we propose a time series machine learning scheme based on the hybrid convolutional neural network/long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) framework for predicting the long-time quantum behavior, given only the short-time dynamics. This scheme takes advantage of both the powerful local feature extraction ability of CNN and the long-term global sequential pattern recognition ability of LSTM. With feature fusion of individually trained CNN-LSTM models for the quantum population and coherence dynamics, the proposed scheme is shown to have high accuracy and robustness in predicting the linearized semiclassical and symmetrical quasiclassical mapping dynamics as well as the mixed quantum-classical Liouville dynamics of various spin-boson models with learning time up to 0.3~ps. Furthermore, if the hybrid network has learned the dynamics of a system, this knowledge is transferable that could significantly enhance the accuracy in predicting the dynamics of a similar system. The hybrid CNN-LSTM network is thus believed to have high predictive power in forecasting the nonadiabatic dynamics in realistic charge and energy transfer processes in photoinduced energy conversion.},

  abstract = {Electronic and/or vibronic coherence has been found by recent ultrafast spectroscopy experiments in many chemical, biological, and material systems. This indicates that there are strong and complicated interactions between electronic states and vibration modes in realistic chemical systems. Therefore, simulations of quantum dynamics with a large number of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom are highly desirable. Due to the efficient compression and localized representation of quantum states in the matrix-product state (MPS) formulation, time-evolution methods based on the MPS framework, which we summarily refer to as tDMRG (time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group) methods, are considered to be promising candidates to study the quantum dynamics of realistic chemical systems. In this work, we benchmark the performances of four different tDMRG methods, including global Taylor, global Krylov, and local one-site and two-site time-dependent variational principles (1TDVP and 2TDVP), with a comparison to multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree and experimental results. Two typical chemical systems of internal conversion and singlet fission are investigated: one containing strong and high-order local and nonlocal electron-vibration couplings and the other exhibiting a continuous phonon bath. The comparison shows that the tDMRG methods (particularly, the 2TDVP method) can describe the full quantum dynamics in large chemical systems accurately and efficiently. Several key parameters in the tDMRG calculation including the truncation error threshold, time interval, and ordering of local sites were also investigated to strike the balance between efficiency and accuracy of results.}

When running such algorithms, effects from quantum noise are inevitable. In our work, we consider a well-known hybrid algorithm, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We study the effects on QAOA from typical quantum noise channels and produce several numerical results. Our research indicates that the output state fidelity, the cost function, and its gradient obtained from QAOA decrease exponentially with respect to the number of gates and noise strength. Moreover, we find that noise merely flattens the parameter space without changing its structure, so optimized parameters will not deviate from their ideal values. Our result provides evidence for the effectiveness of hybrid algorithms running on NISQ devices.},

  abstract = {Quantum error correction is vital for implementing universal quantum computing. A key component is the encoding circuit that maps a product state of physical qubits into the encoded multipartite entangled logical state. Known methods are typically not 'optimal' either in terms of the circuit depth (and therefore the error burden) or the specifics of the target platform, i.e. the native gates and topology of a system. This work introduces a variational compiler for efficiently finding the encoding circuit of general quantum error correcting codes with given quantum hardware. Focusing on the noisy intermediate scale quantum regime, we show how to systematically compile the circuit following an optimising process seeking to minimise the number of noisy operations that are allowed by the noisy quantum hardware or to obtain the highest fidelity of the encoded state with noisy gates. We demonstrate our method by deriving novel encoders for logic states of the five qubit code and the seven qubit Steane code. We describe ways to augment the discovered circuits with error detection. Our method is applicable quite generally for compiling the encoding circuits of quantum error correcting codes.},

In this work, we pursue the development of our previous paper by introducing several technical and analytical extensions to the SA-OO-VQE method. Motivated by the limitations of current quantum computers, the first extension consists in an efficient state-resolution procedure to find the SA-OO-VQE eigenstates, and not just the subspace spanned by them, while remaining in the equi-ensemble framework. This approach avoids expensive intermediate resolutions of the eigenstates by postponing this problem to the very end of the full algorithm. The second extension allows for the estimation of analytical gradients and nonadiabatic couplings, which are crucial in many practical situations ranging from the search of conical intersections to the simulation of quantum dynamics, in, for example, photoisomerization reactions. The accuracy of our new implementations is demonstrated on the formaldimine molecule CH\$\_2\$NH (a minimal Schiff base model relevant for the study of photoisomerization in larger bio-molecules), for which we also perform a geometry optimization to locate a conical intersection between the ground and first-excited electronic states of the molecule.},

We apply this adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) approach to the integrable Lieb-Schultz-Mattis spin chain and the nonintegrable mixed-field Ising model, where it captures both finite-rate and sudden post-quench dynamics with high fidelity. The AVQDS quantum circuits that prepare the time-evolved state are much shallower than those obtained from first-order Trotterization and contain up to 2 orders of magnitude fewer cnot gate operations. We envision that a wide range of dynamical simulations of quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum-computing devices will be made possible through the AVQDS framework.},

  abstract = {The Variational Quantum Eigensolver approach to the electronic structure problem on a quantum computer involves measurement of the Hamiltonian expectation value. Formally, quantum mechanics allows one to measure all mutually commuting or compatible operators simultaneously. Unfortunately, the current hardware permits measuring only a much more limited subset of operators that share a common tensor product eigen-basis. We introduce unitary transformations that transform any fully commuting group of operators to a group that can be measured on current hardware. These unitary operations can be encoded as a sequence of Clifford gates and let us not only measure much larger groups of terms but also to obtain these groups efficiently on a classical computer. The problem of finding the minimum number of fully commuting groups of terms covering the whole Hamiltonian is found to be equivalent to the minimum clique cover problem for a graph representing Hamiltonian terms as vertices and commutativity between them as edges. Tested on a set of molecular electronic Hamiltonians with up to 50 thousand terms, the introduced technique allows for the reduction of the number of separately measurable operator groups down to few hundreds, thus achieving up to 2 orders of magnitude reduction. Based on the test set results, the obtained gain scales at least linearly with the number of qubits.},

  abstract = {The utility of NISQ devices can be increased by algorithms that fit larger problem sizes on smaller devices. One strategy is to exploit a tradeoff between circuit width and circuit depth. Unfortunately, this tradeoff still limits the size of tractable problems since the increased depth is often not realizable before noise dominates. Here, we develop qubit-efficient quantum algorithms for entanglement spectroscopy which avoid this tradeoff. In particular, we develop algorithms for computing the trace of the n-th power of the density operator of a quantum system, \$Tr(\textbackslash rho\^n)\$, (related to the R\textbackslash 'enyi entropy of order n) that use fewer qubits than any previous efficient algorithm while achieving similar performance in the presence of noise, thus enabling spectroscopy of larger quantum systems on NISQ devices than previously possible. Our algorithms, which require a number of qubits independent of n, are variants of previous algorithms with width proportional to n, an asymptotic difference. The crucial ingredient in these new algorithms is the ability to measure and reinitialize subsets of qubits in the course of the computation. By carefully arranging these qubits resets, we are able to reuse qubits and increase the circuit depth without suffering the usual noisy consequences. We also introduce the notion of effective circuit depth as a generalization of standard circuit depth suitable for circuits with qubit resets. This tool helps explain the noise-resilience of our qubit-efficient algorithms and should aid in designing future algorithms. We perform numerical simulations to compare our algorithms to the original variants and show they perform similarly when subjected to noise. Additionally, we experimentally implement one of our qubit-efficient algorithms on the Honeywell System Model H0, estimating \$Tr(\textbackslash rho\^n)\$ for larger n than would have been possible with previous algorithms.},

For any adiabatic approach, this usually leads to serious problems, such as level crossing and/or energy gap closing along the adiabatic evolution path. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm based on adiabatic evolution to obtain molecular eigenstates and eigenenergies in quantum chemistry, which exploits a smooth geometric deformation by changing bond lengths and bond angles. Even with a simple uniform stretching of chemical bonds, this algorithm performs more stably and achieves better accuracy than our previous adiabatic method [Phys. Rev. Research 3, 013104 (2021)]. It solves the problems related to energy gap closing and level crossing along the adiabatic evolution path at large atomic distances.

  abstract = {We show that the notion of generalized Berry phase i.e., non-abelian holonomy, can be used for enabling quantum computation. The computational space is realized by a n-fold degenerate eigenspace of a family of Hamiltonians parametrized by a manifold M. The point of M represents classical configuration of control fields and, for multi-partite systems, couplings between subsystem. Adiabatic loops in the control M induce non trivial unitary transformations on the computational space. For a generic system it is shown that this mechanism allows for universal quantum computation by composing a generic pair of loops in M. PACS numbers: 03.67.Lx, 03.65.Bz In this paper we shall speculate about a novel potential application of non-abelian geometric phases (holonomies) to Quantum Computation [1]. Ever since their discovery geometric phases in quantum theory have been considered a deep and fascinating subject [2]. This is due on the one hand to their unexpected and ubiquitous role in many physical systems, on the other hand to the elegant formulation they admit in terms of concepts borrowed from differential-geometry and topology [3]. Furthermore the existence of analog geometric terms associated with non-abelian groups e.g., U (N) [4] showed how many of the notions developed in (non-abelian) gauge theory have a scope that extends far beyond the study of fundamental interactions. We shall show how by encoding quantum information in one of the eigenspaces of a degenerate Hamiltonian H one can in principle achieve the full quantum computational power by using holonomies only. These holo-nomic computations are realized by moving along loops in a suitable space M of control parameters labelling the family of Hamiltonians to which H belongs. Attached to each point {$\lambda$} {$\in$} M there is a quantum code, and this bundle of codes is endowed with a non-trivial global topology described by a non-abelian gauge field potential A. For generic A the associated holonomies will allow for universal quantum computing. In a sense the ideas presented here suggest that gauge fields might play a role also in the arena of information processing. In the very same way of classical information processing , general quantum computations are realized by networks of elementary bulding blocks. More specifically the dynamics is obtained by switching on and off gate Hamiltonians \{H l \} g l=1. If in this way any unitary over the state-space can be approximated arbitrarily well, the set of gates U l := e i H l is termed universal [5]. A (uni-versal) quantum computer is defined by the state-space H {$\sim$} = C N for data encoding and by a (universal) set of quantum gates. A quantum algorithm consists of the given computation U (T) that acts on the quantum state |{$\psi$} in encoding initial data, its realization as a network of basic gates, along with a (measurement) prescription for extracting the relevant information from |{$\psi$} out. For the aims of this paper it is worthwile to reformulate this setup in a geometrical fashion. Any quantum evolution U (T) = T exp[-i T 0 dtH(t)] can be associated with a path in a space whose points describe the configurations of suitable "control fields" {$\lambda$}, on which the Hamiltonian depends. Indeed any Hamiltonian in C N can be written as H {$\lambda$} = i N 2 l=1 {$\Phi$} l ({$\lambda$}) {$\Gamma$} l ({$\Phi$} l {$\in$} R) where the {$\Gamma$} l 's are a basis of the space of anti-hermitean matrices i.e., they are the generators of the Lie algebra u(N). The control parameter space M is a manifold over which is defined a smooth map {$\Phi$} to u(N). If one is able to drive the control field configuration {$\lambda$} {$\in$} M through a (smooth) path {$\gamma$}: [0, T ] \textrightarrow{} M then a family H(t) := H {$\gamma$}(t) is defined along with the associated uni-tary U {$\gamma$}. Conversely any smooth family H(t) defines a path in M = R N 2. Resorting to this language Quantum Computation can be described as the experimenter's capability of generating a small set of \{{$\gamma$} i \} g i=1 of basic paths such that sequences of the corresponding U {$\gamma$}i 's approximate with arbitrary good accuracy any unitary transformation on the quantum state-space. It is important to stress the, obvious, fact that the path generation is achieved through a classical control process. Non-Abelian Holonomies-In the situation which we are interested in, one deals with {$\gamma$}'s that are loops in M i.e., {$\gamma$}(T) = {$\gamma$}(0), and with a family of Hamilto-nians \{H {$\lambda$} \} {$\lambda\in$}M with same degeneracy structure i.e., no-level crossing. In the general case H {$\lambda$} = H {$\gamma$}(t) has R different eigenvalues \{{$\epsilon$} i \} R i=1 with degeneracies \{n i \}. If {$\Pi$} i ({$\lambda$}) denotes the projector over the eigenspace H i ({$\lambda$}) := span \{|{$\psi$} {$\alpha$} i ({$\lambda$})\} ni {$\alpha$}=1 , of H {$\lambda$} , one has the spectral {$\lambda$}-dependent resolution H {$\lambda$} = R i=1 {$\epsilon$} i ({$\lambda$}) {$\Pi$} i ({$\lambda$}). The state vector evolves according the time-dependent Schroedinger equation i {$\partial$} t |{$\psi$}(t) = H {$\gamma$}(t) |{$\psi$}(t). We shall restrict ourselves to the case in which the loop {$\gamma$}'s are adi-abatic i.e., \textasciimacron{} h \textperiodcentered{} {$\gamma$}/{$\gamma$} {$\ll$} min i =j |{$\epsilon$} j - {$\epsilon$} i |.

  abstract = {Quantum cooling, a deterministic process that drives any state to the lowest eigenstate, has been widely used from studying ground state properties of chemistry and condensed matter quantum physics, to general optimization problems. However, the cooling procedure is generally non-unitary, hence its realization on a quantum computer either requires deep circuits or assumes specific input states with variational circuits. Here, we propose universal quantum cooling algorithms that overcome these limitations. By utilizing a dual phase representation of decaying functions, we show how to universally and deterministically realize a general cooling procedure with shallow quantum circuits. We demonstrate its applications in cooling an arbitrary input state with known ground state energy, corresponding to satisfactory, linear algebra tasks, and quantum state compiling tasks, and preparing unknown eigenvalues and eigenstates, corresponding to quantum many-body problems. Compared to quantum phase estimation, our method uses only one ancillary qubit and much shallower circuits, showing exponential improvement of the circuit complexity with respect to the final state infidelity. We numerically benchmark the algorithms for the \$8\$-qubit Heisenberg model and verify its feasibility for accurately finding eigenenergies and obtaining eigenstate measurements. Our work paves the way for efficient and universal quantum algorithmic cooling with near-term as well as universal fault-tolerant quantum devices.},

These include Green's functions used to compute electron transport in materials and the one-particle reduced density matrices used to compute electric dipoles of molecules. In this paper, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to efficiently estimate such ground state properties with high accuracy using low-depth quantum circuits. We provide an analysis of various costs (circuit repetitions, maximal evolution time, and expected total runtime) as a function of target accuracy, spectral gap, and initial ground state overlap. This algorithm suggests a concrete approach to using early fault tolerant quantum computers for carrying out industry-relevant molecular and materials calculations.},

  abstract = {Quantum state preparation is an important subroutine for quantum computing. We show that any n-qubit quantum state can be prepared with a {$\Theta$}(n)-depth circuit using only single- and two-qubit gates, although with a cost of an exponential amount of ancillary qubits. On the other hand, for sparse quantum states with d{$\geqslant$}2 nonzero entries, we can reduce the circuit depth to {$\Theta$}(log(nd)) with O(ndlogd) ancillary qubits. The algorithm for sparse states is exponentially faster than best-known results and the number of ancillary qubits is nearly optimal and only increases polynomially with the system size. We discuss applications of the results in different quantum computing tasks, such as Hamiltonian simulation, solving linear systems of equations, and realizing quantum random access memories, and find cases with exponential reductions of the circuit depth for all these three tasks. In particular, using our algorithm, we find a family of linear system solving problems enjoying exponential speedups, even compared to the best-known quantum and classical dequantization algorithms.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) coherent spectroscopy has been developed to study molecular dynamics and structures for decades, but its extension into the terahertz (THz) regime remains rare. In this thesis, I describe several experiments using two-dimensional terahertz rotational spectroscopy. Employing intense THz electromagnetic fields and the differential chopping technique, we have extended multi-dimensional coherent spectroscopy into the THz regime. We have observed rotational dynamics of linear, symmetric-top, and asymmetric-top molecular species, indicating that 2D THz spectroscopy is an incisive tool for investigating collective quantum effects of the rotational degree of freedom. Based on the quantum mechanical rigid rotor model, we have developed simulation and calculation approaches to disentangling spectroscopic signals from molecular rotations.},

  abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given Hamiltonian on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. A particular application is to obtain ground or excited states of molecules. The practical realization is currently limited by the complexity of quantum circuits. Here we present a novel approach to reduce quantum circuit complexity in VQE for electronic structure calculations. Our algorithm, called ClusterVQE, splits the initial qubit space into subspaces (qubit clusters) which are further distributed on individual (shallower) quantum circuits. The clusters are obtained based on quantum mutual information reflecting maximal entanglement between qubits, whereas entanglement between different clusters is taken into account via a new "dressed" Hamiltonian. ClusterVQE therefore allows exact simulation of the problem by using fewer qubits and shallower circuit depth compared to standard VQE at the cost of additional classical resources. In addition, a new gradient measurement method without using an ancillary qubit is also developed in this work. Proof-of-principle demonstrations are presented for several molecular systems based on quantum simulators as well as an IBM quantum device with accompanying error mitigation. The efficiency of the new algorithm is comparable to or even improved over qubit-ADAPT-VQE and iterative Qubit Coupled Cluster (iQCC), state-of-the-art circuit-efficient VQE methods to obtain variational ground state energies of molecules on NISQ hardware. Above all, the new ClusterVQE algorithm simultaneously reduces the number of qubits and circuit depth, making it a potential leader for quantum chemistry simulations on NISQ devices.},

  abstract = {It is imperative that useful quantum computers be very difficult to simulate classically; otherwise classical computers could be used for the applications envisioned for the quantum ones. Perfect quantum computers are unarguably exponentially difficult to simulate: the classical resources required grow exponentially with the number of qubits \$N\$ or the depth \$D\$ of the circuit. Real quantum computing devices, however, are characterized by an exponentially decaying fidelity \$\textbackslash mathcal\{F\} \textbackslash sim (1-\textbackslash epsilon)\^\{ND\}\$ with an error rate \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ per operation as small as \$\textbackslash approx 1\textbackslash\%\$ for current devices. In this work, we demonstrate that real quantum computers can be simulated at a tiny fraction of the cost that would be needed for a perfect quantum computer. Our algorithms compress the representations of quantum wavefunctions using matrix product states (MPS), which capture states with low to moderate entanglement very accurately. This compression introduces a finite error rate \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ so that the algorithms closely mimic the behavior of real quantum computing devices. The computing time of our algorithm increases only linearly with \$N\$ and \$D\$. We illustrate our algorithms with simulations of random circuits for qubits connected in both one and two dimensional lattices. We find that \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ can be decreased at a polynomial cost in computing power down to a minimum error \$\textbackslash epsilon\_\textbackslash infty\$. Getting below \$\textbackslash epsilon\_\textbackslash infty\$ requires computing resources that increase exponentially with \$\textbackslash epsilon\_\textbackslash infty/\textbackslash epsilon\$. For a two dimensional array of \$N=54\$ qubits and a circuit with Control-Z gates, error rates better than state-of-the-art devices can be obtained on a laptop in a few hours. For more complex gates such as a swap gate followed by a controlled rotation, the error rate increases by a factor three for similar computing time.},

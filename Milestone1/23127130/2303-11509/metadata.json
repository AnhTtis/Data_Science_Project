    "abstract": "We present a new parton distribution function analysis which includes new data for W boson production in proton-proton collisions and lepton pair production in proton-proton and proton-deuteron collisions. The new data provide strong constraints on the light antiquark parton distribution functions in the proton. We identify an interesting correlation between the $d/u$ ratio and the $\\bar{d}/\\bar{u}$ ratio which leads to a modification of our previous results for the $d/u$ ratio as the parton momentum fraction $x \\rightarrow 1.$",

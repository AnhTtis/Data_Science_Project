    "abstract": "Atom probe tomography (APT) is a 3D analysis technique that offers unique chemical accuracy and sensitivity with sub-nanometer spatial resolution. Recently, there is an increasing interest in the application of APT to complex oxides materials, giving new insight into the relation between local variations in chemical composition and emergent physical properties. However, in contrast to the field of metallurgy, where APT is routinely applied to study materials at the atomic level, complex oxides and their specific field evaporation mechanisms are much less explored. Here, we perform APT measurements on the hexagonal manganite ErMnO3 and systematically study the effect of different experimental parameters on the measured composition and atomic structure. We demonstrate that both the mass resolving power (MRP) and compositional accuracy can be improved by increasing the charge-state ratio (CSR) working at low laser energy (< 5 pJ). Furthermore, we observe a substantial preferential retention of Er atoms, which is suppressed at higher CSRs. We explain our findings based on fundamental field evaporation concepts, expanding the knowledge about the impact of key experimental parameters and the field evaporation process in complex oxides in general.",

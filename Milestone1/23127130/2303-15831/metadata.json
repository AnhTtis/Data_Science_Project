    "abstract": "During an activity, knowing the mental workload (MWL) of the user allows to improve the Human-Machine Interactions (HMI). Indeed, the MWL has an impact on the individual and its interaction with the environment. Monitoring it is therefore a crucial issue. In this context, we have created the virtual game Back to Pizza which is based on the N-back task (commonly used for measuring MWL). In this more playful variant, users must carry out orders from customers of a pizza food truck. It is an interactive game that involves the audience of the IHM'23 conference, choosing several parameters like the number of ingredients. During this experience, the objective is to measure MWL in real time through an ElectroEncephaloGraph (EEG) and visual feedback on MWL level is given to the audience. With this demonstration, we propose to present a concept of a virtual interactive game that measures MWL in real time.",

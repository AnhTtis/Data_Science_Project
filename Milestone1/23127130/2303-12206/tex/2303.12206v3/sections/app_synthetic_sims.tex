We run a set of synthetic simulations for the two-state model of \cref{s.theory}.
We use 1000 patients and 500 time steps.
For each patient $i$, we generate their parameters independently at random as 
$p_i, g_i, \tau_i \sim \text{Unif}(0, 0.2)$.
We vary the budget as $B \in \{5, 10, 50, 100, 300\}$ and we try four policies:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\NULL$: Does not give any interventions.
\item $\baseline$: Gives interventions to $B$ patients uniformly at random, out of those in state 0.
\item $\DPI(0)$: Our algorithm which prioritizes patients based on the value of $\tau_i/(p_i + g_i)$ (see \cref{prop:z_clean_form}). 
\item $\textsf{Whittle}$: Prioritizes patients based on the value of $\frac{p_i+\tau_i}{g_i} -  \frac{p_i(p_i + g_i + \tau_i)}{g_i(p_i + g_i)}$, which corresponds to the Whittle's index for patient $i$ under the two-state model.
\end{itemize}
The results, given as a percentage improvement over the $\NULL$ policy, can be found in \cref{tab.synthetic_results}.

Budget & \quad $\baseline$ (random) \;  & $\DPI(0)$ & $\textsf{Whittle}$  \\ \midrule
5      &  0.72\%  & 3.35\%   & 3.30\%  \\
10     &  1.45\%  & 5.10\%   & 5.15\%  \\ 
50     &  6.66\%  & 13.99\%  & 13.95\%   \\
100    &  12.40\% & 21.13\%  & 21.10\%   \\
300    &  31.76\% & 34.46\%  & 34.46\%   \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

We see that the performance of $\DPI$ and $\textsf{Whittle}$ are almost identical, while they both significantly outperform $\baseline$.
We also observe that the relative improvement over $\baseline$ decreases in the budget, which means that carefully targeting patients is more important when the budget is small. When the budget is large, many patients can get the intervention, so  careful targeting is not as critical.

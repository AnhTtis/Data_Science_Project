\ABSTRACT{

\textbf{Problem definition:}
Behavioral health interventions, delivered through digital platforms, have the potential to significantly improve health outcomes, through education, motivation, reminders, and outreach. We study the problem of optimizing personalized interventions for patients to maximize a long-term outcome, in a setting where interventions are costly and capacity-constrained. 

\textbf{Methodology/results:}
This paper provides a model-free approach to solving this problem. Our development of a new approach is motivated by generic model-free approaches from the reinforcement learning literature being too data intensive for our application, while simpler bandit approaches make progress at the expense of ignoring long-term patient dynamics. We present a new algorithm we dub $\DPI$ that approximates one step of policy iteration. 
Implementing $\DPI$ simply consists of a prediction task from offline data, alleviating the need for online experimentation.
Theoretically, we show that under a natural set of structural assumptions on patient dynamics, $\DPI$ surprisingly recovers at least 1/2 of the improvement possible between a na\"ive baseline policy and the optimal policy. 
At the same time, $\DPI$ is both robust to estimation errors and interpretable. Through an empirical case study on a mobile health platform for improving treatment adherence for tuberculosis, we find that $\DPI$ can provide the same efficacy as the status quo with approximately \textit{half} the capacity of interventions.

\textbf{Managerial implications:}
$\DPI$ is general and is easily implementable for organizations aiming to improve long-term behavior through targeted interventions.
Our case study suggests that the platform's costs of deploying interventions can potentially be cut by 50\%, which facilitates the ability to scale up the system in a cost-efficient fashion.

\textbf{Problem definition:}
Behavioral health interventions, delivered through digital platforms, have the potential to significantly improve health outcomes, through education, motivation, reminders, and outreach. 
% Most digital applications for behavioral health 
These platforms are often initially deployed using ad hoc heuristics for determining which patients should receive an intervention at which time.
A major opportunity for such platforms is to leverage data from initial deployment to develop policies for more targeted and personalized intervention strategies. 
We focus on a resource-limited setting, where interventions are costly and therefore must be allocated judiciously.

\textbf{Methodology/results:}
We develop a new algorithm for targeting interventions dubbed \textit{Decomposed Policy Iteration} ($\DPI$). 
This model-free algorithm can be thought of as a single step of policy iteration, where the value function is `decomposed' down to each patient, resulting in an index-based rule.
Implementing $\DPI$ consists a prediction task from offline data, alleviating the need for online experimentation.
Using a simple model of patient behavior, we prove that $\DPI$ recovers at least 1/2 of the \textit{improvement} between an optimal policy and a na\"ive baseline policy, and we show that this guarantee is robust to estimation errors.
We evaluate the approach via a case study on a mobile health platform whose aim is to improve treatment adherence for patients with tuberculosis.
Using a validated simulation model for patient behavior, we find that $\DPI$ results in the same adherence verification rate as current practice using only \textit{half} as many interventions.

% We collaborate with a behavioral health start-up and develop a new algorithm for offline policy improvement, \textit{Decomposed Policy Iteration} ($\DPI$).
% This algorithm is simple, model-free, and can be thought of as a single step of policy iteration.
% $\DPI$ leverages offline data, alleviating the need for experimentation and ensures safety during deployment. 
% We develop a theoretical performance guarantee relative to the best attainable improvement over some existing policy. 
% We prove that the guarantee is robust and scales gracefully with respect to calibration errors. 
% We then demonstrate how our approach is easily implementable and test its performance on a validated simulation model of the behavioral health setting of our partner organization. We find that $\DPI$ can achieve the same performance as current practice, with \textit{half} the capacity. Furthermore, $\DPI$ outperforms a benchmark contextual bandit model, with the highest gains in scenarios of limited resources.

\textbf{Managerial implications:}
The policy we develop is general and is easily implementable for any organization aiming to improve long-term engagement through targeted interventions.
For such organizations, our results suggest that the costs of deploying interventions can potentially be cut by 50\%.
% can be substantially reduced.

% Our approach is general and can be estimated from datasets that scale with the state-space of a single user. It is therefore easily implementable by any organization aiming to improve long-term engagement through personalized outreach.

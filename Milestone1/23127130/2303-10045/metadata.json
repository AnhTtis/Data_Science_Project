    "abstract": "In this work we study a sequence of perfect t-embeddings of uniformly weighted Aztec diamonds. We show that these perfect t-embeddings can be used to prove convergence of gradients of height fluctuations to those of the Gaussian free field. In particular we provide a first proof of the existence of a model satisfying all conditions of the main theorem of arXiv:2109.06272. This confirms the prediction of arXiv:2002.07540. An important part of our proof is to exhibit exact integral formulas for perfect t-embeddings of uniformly weighted Aztec diamonds.\n  In addition, we construct and analyze perfect t-embeddings of another sequence of uniformly weighted finite graphs called tower graphs. Although we do not check all technical assumptions of the mentioned theorem for these graphs, we use perfect t-embeddings to derive a simple transformation which identifies height fluctuations on the tower graph with those of the Aztec diamond.",

    "abstract": "Heavy-quark spin symmetry is explicitly broken by the mass splitting between a heavy-light pseudoscalar meson and its vector partner. This fact plays a pivotal role in the physics of states whose mass lies close to the threshold of an open-flavor meson pair, like $X(3872)$. We show that this source of heavy-quark spin symmetry breaking can be systematically included within the diabatic representation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We verify that including all the appropriate coupled channels guarantees conservation of total angular momentum, parity, and charge-conjugation parity. This marks a fundamental step towards a unified, first-principles study of quarkonia and meson molecules with hidden flavor.",

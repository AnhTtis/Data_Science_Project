We propose to use dense visual affordance for manipulating deformable objects with complex states and dynamics.
For tasks that require a series of strongly related actions, we further empower the proposed affordance with the awareness of a certain action's influence on subsequent actions.
We propose a self-supervised framework with novel designs to efficiently collect multi-stage interaction data and stably learn this representation. Experiments on representative tasks and in the real world show the superiority of our proposed dense affordance and the learning framework.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we introduce OmniAvatar, a novel 3D-aware generative model for synthesis of controllable high-fidelity human head. Our model achieves disentangled semantic control by factoring the generative process into 3D-aware canonical head synthesis and implicit volume deformation to target shapes and expressions. By learning a deformable signed distance function with  canonical volumetric correspondence, we instill the geometric prior knowledge of a 3D statistical head model into the generation of neural radiance fields, enabling superior generative capability to novel shapes and expressions. Our approach demonstrates expressive and compelling talking head generation and portrait image animation with fine-grained control accuracy and temporal realism. We believe the proposed method presents an interesting direction for 3D avatar creation and animation, which sheds light on many potential downstream tasks.

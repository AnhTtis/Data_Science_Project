    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the Dirichlet problem for the homogeneous $k$-Hessian equation with prescribed asymptotic behavior at $0\\inΩ$ where $Ω$ is a $(k-1)$-convex bounded domain in the Euclidean space. The prescribed asymptotic behavior at $0$ of the solution is zero if $k>\\frac{n}{2}$, it is $\\log|x|+O(1)$ if $k=\\frac{n}{2}$ and $-|x|^{\\frac{2k-n}{n}}+O(1)$ if $k<\\frac{n}{2}$. To solve this problem, we consider the Dirichlet problem of the approximating $k$-Hessian equation in $Ω\\setminus \\overline{B_r(0)}$ with $r$ small. We firstly construct the subsolution of the approximating $k$-Hessian equation. Then we derive the pointwise $C^{2}$-estimates of the approximating equation based on new gradient and second order estimates established previously by the second author and the third author. In addition, we prove a uniform positive lower bound of the gradient if the domain is starshaped with respect to $0$. As an application, we prove an identity along the level set of the approximating solution and obtain a nearly monotonicity formula. In particular, we get a weighted geometric inequality for smoothly and strictly $(k-1)$-convex starshaped closed hypersurface in $\\mathbb R^n$ with $\\frac{n}{2}\\le k<n$.",

    \caption{We propose a unified method for four low-level structure segmentation tasks: camouflaged object, forgery, shadow and defocus blur detection~(Top). Our approach relies on a pre-trained frozen transformer backbone that leverages explicit extracted features, \eg, the frozen embedded features and high-frequency components, to prompt knowledge. }

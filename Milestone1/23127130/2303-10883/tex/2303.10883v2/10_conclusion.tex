\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present explicit visual prompting to unify the solutions of low-level structure segmentations.
We mainly focus on two kinds of features: the frozen features from patch embedding and the high-frequency components from the original image. Equipped with our method, we find that a frozen vision transformer backbone from the ImageNet with limited tunable parameters can achieve similar performance as the full-tuned network structures, also the state-of-the-art performance compared with the other task-specific methods. For future works, we will extend our approach to other related problems and hope it can promote further exploration of visual prompting.

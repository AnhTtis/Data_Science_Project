    "abstract": "Let $f$ be an Hecke eigenform for the group $Γ_{0}(q)$ and $χ_{d}$ be a primitive quadratic character of conductor $|d|$. In this article, we prove an asymptotic for the second moment of the derivative of $L(s, f \\otimes χ_{8d})$ at the central point $1/2$, which was previously known under GRH by Petrow \\cite{petrow}.",

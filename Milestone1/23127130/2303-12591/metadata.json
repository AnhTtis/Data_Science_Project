    "abstract": "We investigate a system of four nearest neighbour bidirectional coupled phase oscillators of dissimilar initial frequencies in a ring at the changeover into a synchronizing state. There are twenty four permutations upon assigning the initial frequencies to the oscillators. The local interaction between the adjacent coupled phase oscillators introduces details to the synchronization features. Therefore, for the four unalike local coupled oscillators, we classify all possible arrangements into three classes, where each class contains eight configurations. The synchronized state appears at the distinctive coupling when the oscillators transit to synchrony having noticeable characteristics for each class. Also, the unison behaviour emerges when a well-defined phase condition is developed. We utilize this conspicuous phase condition to obtain a mathematical expression predicting the distinguishing coupling for each class once the oscillators have a common frequency. The obtained expression is given in terms of the initial frequencies, at the minute the four local coupled phase oscillators attain the same frequency. The analytic formula of the critical coupling allows us to obtain expressions usable to determine the phase differences at the swop into a synchronization stage.",

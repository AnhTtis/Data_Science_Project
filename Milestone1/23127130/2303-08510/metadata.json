    "abstract": "This work deals with matter-wave bright soliton molecules in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates described by three-component Gross-Pitaevskii equations with non-autonomous nonlinearities that can be tuned by Feshbach resonance management. Notably, it portrays the possibility of generating bright bound soliton molecules with the help of an exact analytic solution under a controlled velocity resonance mechanism. Results show that these soliton molecules experience the effects of time-varying nonlinearities and modulate themselves during propagation by keeping their stable properties. Significantly, the chosen periodic and kink-like nonlinearities expose the snaking, bending, compression, and amplification of multi-structured soliton molecules along with appreciable changes in their amplitude, velocity, width, and oscillations of the molecule profiles. The present results will add significant knowledge to a complete understanding beyond the known interaction dynamics of matter-wave bright solitons in spinor condensates.",

    "abstract": "Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ is believed to be a magnetic Weyl semimetal. It displays large anomalous Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall effects with a remarkably large anomalous Hall angle. Here, we present a comprehensive study of how substituting Co by Fe or Ni affects the electrical and thermoelectric transport. We find that doping alters the amplitude of the anomalous transverse coefficients. The maximum decrease in the amplitude of the low-temperature anomalous Hall conductivity $σ^A_{ij}$ is twofold. Comparing our results with theoretical calculations of the Berry spectrum assuming a rigid shift of the Fermi level, we find that given the modest shift in the position of the chemical potential induced by doping, the experimentally observed variation occurs five times faster than expected. Doping affects the amplitude and the sign of the anomalous Nernst coefficient. Despite these drastic changes, the amplitude of the $α^A_{ij}/σ^A_{ij}$ ratio at the Curie temperature remains close to $\\approx 0.5 k_B/e$, in agreement with the scaling relationship observed across many topological magnets.",

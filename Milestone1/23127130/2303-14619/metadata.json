    "abstract": "We propose a finite-time quantum Szilard engine (QSE) with a quantum particle with spin as the working substance (WS) to accelerate the operation of information engines. We introduce a Maxwell's demon (MD) to probe the spin state within a finite measurement time $t_{\\rm M}$ to capture the which-way information of the particle, quantified by the mutual information $I(t_{\\rm{M}})$ between WS and MD. We establish that the efficiency $η$ of QSE is bounded by $η\\leq1-(1-η_{\\rm{C}}){\\rm ln}2/I(t_{\\rm M})$, where $I(t_{\\rm M})/\\rm{ln}2$ characterizes the ideality of quantum measurement, and approaches $1$ for the Carnot efficiency reached under ideal measurement in quasi-static regime. We find that the power of QSE scales as $P\\propto t_{\\rm M}^{3}$ in the short-time regime and as $P\\propto t_{\\rm M}^{-1}$ in the long-time regime. Additionally, considering the energy cost for erasing the MD's memory required by Landauer's principle, there exists a threshold time that guarantees QSE to output positive work.",

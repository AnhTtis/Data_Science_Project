    "abstract": "$f(T)$ cosmology has shown promise in explaining aspects of cosmic evolution. In this work, we analyze constraints on leading models of $f(T)$ gravity in the context of the recently released Pantheon+ data set, together with comparisons with previous releases. We also consider other late-time data sets including cosmic chronometers and baryonic acoustic oscillation data. Our main result is that we find that the different $f(T)$ models under investigation connect to a variety of Hubble constant, which may help alleviate the cosmic tension on this parameter.",

    "abstract": "The paper considers the problem of calculating the distribution function of a strictly stable law at $x\\to\\infty$. To solve this problem, an expansion of the distribution function in a power series was obtained, and an estimate of the remainder term was also obtained. It was shown that in the case $α<1$ this series was convergent for any $x$, in the case $α=1$ the series was convergent at $N\\to\\infty$ in the domain $|x|>1$, and in the case $α>1$ the series was asymptotic at $x\\to\\infty$. The case $α=1$ was considered separately and it was demonstrated that in that case the series converges to the generalized Cauchy distribution. An estimate for the threshold coordinate $x_\\varepsilon^N$ was obtained which determined the area of applicability of the obtained expansion. It was shown that in the domain $|x|\\geqslant x_\\varepsilon^N$ this power series could be used to calculate the distribution function, which completely solved the problem of calculating the distribution function at large $x$.",

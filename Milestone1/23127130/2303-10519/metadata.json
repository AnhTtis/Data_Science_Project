    "abstract": "We investigate how a single resonator with a time-modulated component extracts power from an external ambient source. However, the collected power is largely dependent on the precise choice of the modulation signal frequency. We focus on the power absorbed from external vibration using a one degree-of-freedom mechanical resonator where the damper has a time-varying component. We show that time modulation can make a significant difference in the amount of harvested power, leading to more than 10 times enhancement with respect to an analogous system without time modulation. We also find that a narrow band pair of peak and dip in the spectrum of the absorbed power occurs because of the presence of an exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD). In this narrow frequency range, the delay between the damper modulating signal and the external vibrating signal largely affects the collected power. The high frequency-selectivity of EPD-induced power management could potentially be used in sensing and spectrometer applications.",

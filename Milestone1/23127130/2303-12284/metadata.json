    "abstract": "We perform high-resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with neutrino transport of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers resulting in a long-lived remnant neutron star, with properties typical of galactic BNS and consistent with those inferred for the first observed BNS merger GW170817. We demonstrate self-consistently that within $\\lesssim\\!30$ ms post-merger magnetized ($σ\\sim 5-10$) twin polar jets emerge with asymptotic Lorentz factor $Γ\\sim 5-10$, which successfully break out from the merger debris within $\\lesssim\\!20$ ms. A fast ($v\\lesssim 0.6c$), magnetized ($σ\\sim 0.1$) wind surrounds the jet core and generates a UV/blue kilonova precursor on timescales of hours, similar to the precursor signal due to free neutron decay in fast dynamical ejecta. Post-merger ejecta are quickly dominated by MHD-driven outflows from an accretion disk. We demonstrate that within only 50 ms post-merger, $\\gtrsim 2\\times 10^{-2}M_\\odot$ of lanthanide-free, quasi-spherical ejecta with velocity $\\sim\\!0.1c$ is launched, yielding a kilonova signal consistent with GW170817 on timescales of $\\lesssim\\!5$\\,d.",

    "abstract": "R packages are the fundamental units of reproducible code in R, providing a\nmechanism for distributing user-developed code, documentation, and data. Docker\nis a virtualization technology that allows applications and their dependencies\nto be distributed and run reproducibly across platforms. The pracpac package\nprovides an interface to create Docker images that contain custom R packages.\nThe pracpac package leverages the renv package management tool to ensure\nreproducibility by building dependency packages inside the container image\nmirroring those installed on the developer's system. The pracpac package can be\nused to containerize any R package to deploy with other domain-specific non-R\ntools, Shiny applications, or entire data analysis pipelines. The pracpac\npackage source code is available under the MIT license on GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/signaturescience/pracpac.",

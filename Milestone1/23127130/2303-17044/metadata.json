    "abstract": "We present the idea of emergent qubits by exact constructions. We rigorously transform the toric code model into a problem of emergent qubits, and write all its eigenstates exactly. As byproducts of this exercise, we introduce a punctured version of the model on torus and an open version on cylinder, both realizing independent emergent qubits perfectly. The exact eigenstates of the toric code and other models are shown to be realized by applying CNOT gates on independent qubits.",

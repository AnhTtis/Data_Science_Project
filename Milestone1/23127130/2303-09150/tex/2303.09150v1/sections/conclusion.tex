\label{sec:conclu}
\noindent In this work, we take the first step towards the systematic generation of memorable yet secure passphrases. We presented a novel in-use passphrase data-set and leveraged the linguistic properties to propose~\system{}, a passphrase generation method. In the process, we also created a framework for measuring memorability and guessability of passphrases. Our exploration, aside from creation of \system{}, provides multiple important insights. First, our ecologically valid in use  \userpp passphrases show that users, left to their device choose weak passphrases to optimize for memorability which is in line with earlier work~\cite{bonneau_linguistic_2012}. %
Second, we  show %
while system-generated passphrases today optimize primarily for security, users prefer passphrases with proper syntax over a random set of words due to memorability. Finally, our work reveals that there is a trade-off between memorability and guessability, and it is possible to balance these two factors for creating more usable system-generated passphrases. Our high-level observation is likely to translate to other non-English languages and culture-sensitive passphrases which is a fertile avenue for future work. %

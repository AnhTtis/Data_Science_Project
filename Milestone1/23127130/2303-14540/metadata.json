    "abstract": "Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is a multiple access technique generalizing conventional techniques, such as, space-division multiple access (SDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and physical layer multi-casting, which aims to address multi-user interference (MUI) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this study, we leverage the interference management capabilities of RSMA to tackle the issue of inter-carrier interference (ICI) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. We formulate a problem to find the optimal subcarrier and power allocation for downlink transmission in a two-user system using RSMA and OFDM and propose a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm to obtain a solution. The sum-rate performance of the proposed OFDM-RSMA scheme is compared with that of conventional orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and OFDM-NOMA by numerical results. It is shown that the proposed OFDM-RSMA outperforms OFDM-NOMA and OFDMA under ICI in diverse propagation channel conditions owing to its flexible structure and robust interference management capabilities.",

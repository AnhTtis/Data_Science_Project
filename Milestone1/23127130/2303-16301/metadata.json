    "abstract": "Post-processing typically takes the outputs of a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and applies linear statistical techniques to produce improve localized forecasts, by including additional observations, or determining systematic errors at a finer scale. In this pilot study, we investigate the benefits and challenges of using non-linear neural network (NN) based methods to post-process multiple weather features -- temperature, moisture, wind, geopotential height, precipitable water -- at 30 vertical levels, globally and at lead times up to 7 days. We show that we can achieve accuracy improvements of up to 12% (RMSE) in a field such as temperature at 850hPa for a 7 day forecast. However, we recognize the need to strengthen foundational work on objectively measuring a sharp and correct forecast. We discuss the challenges of using standard metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) or anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) as we move from linear statistical models to more complex non-linear machine learning approaches for post-processing global weather forecasts.",

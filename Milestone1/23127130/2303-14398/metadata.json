    "abstract": "The emission of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A at 18 TeV has been detected by the large high-altitude air shower observatory (LHAASO). We suggest jitter radiation as a possible explanation for the TeV emission for this energetic GRB. In our scenario, the radiation field is linked to the perturbation field, and the perturbation field is dominated by kinetic turbulence. Kinetic turbulence takes a vital role in both magnetic field generation and particle acceleration. The jitter radiation can reach the TeV energy band when we consider either electron cooling or Landau damping. We further suggest that the jitter radiation in the very high-energy band is coherent emission. Our modeling results can be constrained by the observational results of GRB 221009A in the TeV energy band. This radiation mechanism is expected to have wide applications in the high-energy astrophysical research field.",

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose Real Face Foundation Representation Learning (RFFR), which learns a general representation of real faces by training on a large number of real face images. The model is sensitive to unknown features outside the distribution of RFFR, and therefore effectively identifies fake face images of various forms. Extensive experiments under cross-domain settings demonstrate the superiority of performing deepfake detection with RFFR, as we show the resulting detectors are less prone to overfitting and generalize well to unseen face manipulations.

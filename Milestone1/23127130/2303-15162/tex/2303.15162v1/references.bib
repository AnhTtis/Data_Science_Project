abstract = {Traditional blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin, focus on transactions in which entire amount is transferred from one owner to the other, in a single, atomic operation. This model has been re-used in the context of payment networks such as Lightning network. In this work, we propose and investigate new payment model, called split payments, in which the total amount to be transferred is split into unit-amounts and is transferred independently through the same or different routes. By splitting the payments this way, we achieve an improved total liquidity of the payment network, simplify the route advertising, reduce the amount of funds needed to be locked in the channels, and improve the privacy properties.},

@article{Aiyer2005BARmodel,
abstract = {This paper describes a general approach to constructing cooperative services that span multiple administrative domains. In such envi- ronments, protocols must tolerate both Byzantine behaviors when broken, misconfigured, or malicious nodes arbitrarily deviate from their specification and rational behaviors when selfish nodes de- viate from their specification to increase their local benefit. The papermakes three contributions: (1) It introduces the BAR (Byzan- tine,Altruistic, Rational)model as a foundation for reasoning about cooperative services; (2) It proposes a general three-level architec- ture to reduce the complexity of building services under the BAR model; and (3) It describes an implementation of BAR-B, the first cooperative backup service to tolerate both Byzantine users and an unbounded number of rational users. At the core of BAR-B is an asynchronous replicated state machine that provides the custom- ary safety and liveness guarantees despite nodes exhibiting both Byzantine and rational behaviors. Our prototype provides accept- able performance for our application: our BAR-tolerant state ma- chine executes 15 requests per second, and our BAR-B backup ser- vice can back up 100MB of data in under 4 minutes.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new replication algorithm that is able to tolerate Byzantine faults. We believe that Byzantine-fault-tolerant algorithms will be increasingly important in the future because malicious attacks and software errors are increasingly common and can cause faulty nodes to exhibit arbitrary behavior. Whereas previous algorithms assumed a synchronous system or were too slow to be used in practice, the algorithm described in this paper is practical: it works in asynchronous environments like the Internet and incorporates several important optimizations that improve the response time of previous algorithms by more than an order of magnitude. We implemented a Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS service using our algorithm and measured its performance. The results show that our service is only 3{\%} slower than a standard unreplicated NFS.},

Although  the  conventional  wisdom$\backslash$ris  to  build  atop  a (weakly)  synchronous  protocol  such$\backslash$ras  PBFT (or  a  variation  thereof),  such  protocols  rely$\backslash$rcritically  on  network  timing  assumptions,   and  only$\backslash$rguarantee  liveness  when  the  network  behaves  as  ex-$\backslash$rpected.  We  argue  these  protocols  are  ill-suited  for  this$\backslash$rdeployment  scenario.$\backslash$r$\backslash$rWe  present  an  alternative,  HoneyBadgerBFT,$\backslash$rthe  first  practical  asynchronous  BFT  protocol,  which$\backslash$rguarantees  liveness  without  making  any  timing  as-$\backslash$rsumptions.  We  base  our  solution  on  a  novel  atomic$\backslash$rbroadcast  protocol  that  achieves  optimal  asymptotic$\backslash$refficiency.  We  present  an  implementation   and  ex-$\backslash$rperimental  results  to  show  our  system  can  achieve$\backslash$rthroughput  of  tens  of  thousands  of  transactions  per$\backslash$rsecond,   and  scales  to  over  a  hundred  nodes  on  a$\backslash$rwide  area  network.  We  even  conduct  BFT  experi-$\backslash$rments  over  Tor,  without  needing  to  tune  any  parame-$\backslash$rters.  Unlike  the  alternatives,  HoneyBadgerBFT  sim-$\backslash$rply  does  not  care  about  the  underlying  network.},

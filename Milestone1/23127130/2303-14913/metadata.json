    "abstract": "To address the muon $g-2$ anomaly and the violation of the lepton flavor universality in the semileptonic decays of $B$ mesons, Bélanger, Delaunay, and Westhoff introduced a new sector consisting of vectorlike fermions and two scalar charged under an extra $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. The exotic Yukawa interactions in this model lead to the quark mixing responsible for the additional contributions to the flavor changing neutral currents in $B$-meson decays. In this paper, we derive the analytic expression of the new physics contributions to the Wilson coefficient $C_7$ in the effective Hamiltonian. By calculating the branching ratio of the inclusive radiative $B$ decay, the impact of current experimental data of the $b \\rightarrow s γ$ transition on the model and the future prospect at the Belle II experiment are investigated. Taking into account the recent data on the CKM unitarity violation, the updated constraints on the flavor observables relevant to the $b \\rightarrow s$ transitions, and the perturbation limits of the couplings, the viable parameter regions of the model are identified.",

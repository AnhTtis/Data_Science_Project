    "abstract": "Given graphs $H$ and $F$, $\\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)$ denotes the largest number of copies of $H$ in $F$-free $n$-vertex graphs. Let $χ(H)<χ(F)=r+1$. We say that $H$ is $F$-Turán-stable if the following holds. For any $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists $δ>0$ such that if an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph $G$ contains at least $\\mathrm{ex}(n,H,F)-δn^{|V(H)|}$ copies of $H$, then the edit distance of $G$ and the $r$-partite Turán graph is at most $\\varepsilon n^2$. We say that $H$ is weakly $F$-Turán-stable if the same holds with the Turán graph replaced by any complete $r$-partite graph $T$. It is known that such stability implies exact results in several cases. We show that complete multipartite graphs with chromatic number at most $r$ are weakly $K_{r+1}$-Turán-stable. Answering a question of Morrison, Nir, Norin, Rzażewski and Wesolek positively, we show that for every graph $H$, if $r$ is large enough, then $H$ is $K_{r+1}$-Turán-stable. Finally, we prove that if $H$ is bipartite, then it is weakly $C_{2k+1}$-Turán-stable for $k$ large enough.",

    "abstract": "Consider a connected homogeneous Riemannian manifold $(M,ds^2)$ and a Riemannian covering $(M,ds^2) \\to Γ\\backslash (M,ds^2)$. If $Γ\\backslash (M,ds^2)$ is homogeneous then every $γ\\in Γ$ is an isometry of constant displacement. The Homogeneity Conjecture suggests the converse: if every $γ\\in Γ$ is an isometry of constant displacement on $(M,ds^2)$ then $Γ\\backslash (M,ds^2)$ is homogeneous. We survey the cases in which the Homogeneity Conjecture has been verified, including some new results, and suggest some related open problems.",

\begin{abstract}
Ionization of matter by energetic radiation generally causes complex secondary reactions which are hard to decipher. Using large helium nanodroplets irradiated by XUV photons, we show that the full chain of processes ensuing primary photoionization can be tracked in detail by means of high-resolution electron spectroscopy. We find that elastic and inelastic scattering of photoelectrons efficiently induces interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) in the droplets. This type of indirect ICD even becomes the dominant process of electron emission in nearly the entire XUV range in large droplets with radius $\gtrsim40~$nm. Indirect ICD processes induced by electron scattering likely play an important role in other condensed phase systems exposed to ionizing radiation as well, including biological matter.

\maketitle


Ionization of matter by extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and x-ray radiation involves cascades of secondary processes including electron scattering, intramolecular relaxation, and intermolecular transfer of charge and energy. These cascades comprise both ultrafast electronic processes and nuclear motion, spanning time scales of femtoseconds up to nanoseconds and beyond. Unravelling the details of such ionization cascades generally is a formidable task due to the high complexity of interactions and the resulting congestion of experimental spectra~\cite{Stumpf:2016}. However, understanding and even controlling ionization mechanisms in condensed phase systems, in particular those producing low-energy electrons that cause radiation damage in biological matter~\cite{Alizadeh:2015,Boudaiffa:2000}, is crucial for improving radiotherapies~\cite{sanche2016interaction}. 
Here we present a comprehensive study of the ionization mechanisms of a model condensed-phase system -- nanometer-sized droplets of helium (He) -- by XUV radiation. Owing to the simple electronic structure of the He atom and the peculiar quantum-fluid properties of He nanodroplets, we are able to resolve all primary and secondary ionization processes up to the level of involved excited quantum states and charge states of the products. In particular, we find that both elastic and inelastic electron collisions at He atoms in the droplets efficiently induce further ionizations by Interatomic Coulombic Decay (ICD)~\cite{Cederbaum:1997,Kuleff:2010}. For large He droplets with radius $\gtrsim40$~nm, electron impact-induced ICD even becomes the dominant channel of electron and ion emission. Variants of ICD have been observed both for pure He droplets and for heterogeneous droplets doped with foreign species. In those experiments, He droplets were resonantly excited or simultaneously ionized and excited by XUV radiation~\cite{Peterka:2006,Wang:2008,Ovcharenko:2014,Shcherbinin:2017,Wiegandt:2019,Buchta:2013,Ltaief:2019,Ovcharenko:2020,LaForge:2021}. ICD-like processes have also been detected as minor channels in strong-field ionized He droplets and rare-gas clusters where electron-ion recombination lead to the population of excited atomic states~\cite{SchuetteCorrelated:2015,oelze:2017,Kelbg:2019,Kelbg:2020}. 

The indirect ICD process reported here is not induced directly by XUV radiation but by electrons emitted by primary photoionization, subsequently interacting with He atoms of the droplet. We observe it for both pure and doped He droplets in a broad range of photon energies $h\nu>44$~eV up to the soft x-ray range. While this indirect ICD process is particularly well discernable in He nanodroplets, we believe that it plays an important role in all condensed-phase media subjected to ionizing radiation. In particular molecular systems such as liquid water tend to form electronically excited states (excitons) by electron-ion recombination which subsequently decay by ICD. While excitons have been found to diffuse over large distances in water ice~\cite{Petrik:2003}, their characteristics and mobility remain poorely understood~\cite{garrett2004role}.

For the analysis of secondary processes leading to ICD we use
He nanodroplets and performed two experiments at the Gasphase beamline at the Synchrotron radiation facility Elettra Trieste, Italy. The setups are schematically depicted in Fig.~1. In the first one [Fig.~1 a)], a mobile He droplet apparatus was attached to an electron-ion coincidence velocity-map imaging (VMI) spectrometer~\cite{OKeeffe:2011}. This arrangement has been described before~\cite{Buchta:2013,BuchtaJCP:2013}. In short, a continuous beam of He nanodroplets containing $10^4$ up to $\sim 10^8$ He atoms per droplet is generated by expanding He out of a cryogenic nozzle at a temperature ranging from 16 down to 8~K and 50~bar He backing pressure. A mechanical chopper is used for discriminating all the spectra shown here from background.

\end{figure}

In the detector chamber further downstream, the He droplet beam intersects the XUV beam with flux $\Phi\approx10^{14}$~s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ in the VMI spectrometer at right angles. Electron spectra are inferred from electron images by Abel inversion~\cite{Dick:2014}. This setup allows us to simultaneously measure spectra of all emitted electrons and of electrons emitted in coincidence with specific fragment ions in a wide energy range. In the second arrangement [Fig.~1 b)], an hemispherical electron analyzer (VG-220i)
%~\cite{maartensson:1994} 
mounted at the magic angle is used to measure high-resolution electron spectra.

\end{figure}

The present study focuses on the photon-energy range $h\nu\gtrsim 44$~eV in which He droplets are directly photoionized and the emitted electron can further excite or ionize a He atom in the droplet by inelastic collision. As example, at $h\nu=46.5$~eV [see Fig.~2 a)], electron spectra contain both a photoline at electron energy $E_e=h\nu - E_i=21.9$~eV, where $E_i=24.6$~eV is the ionization energy of He, and an electron energy-loss (EEL) peak at $E_e - E_*\approx 2$~eV, where $E_*$ is the energy of the impact-excited state~\cite{Shcherbinin:2019}. The colored lines indicate various He droplet sizes in the range of 5 to 75~nm (red to black). The EEL peaks in the kinetic energy range $0.2$-$2.5$~eV are due to photoelectron-helium ($e$-He) impact excitation. EEL spectra revealing the states that are impact excited at different $h\nu$'s are shown in Fig.~1 of the Supplemental Material (SM). 

Besides these common features present for all droplet sizes, more features appear and grow in the electron spectra when the droplet radius is increased from $R=5$~nm [red line in Fig.~2 a)] to $\gtrsim20$~nm (black line). The salient new feature is a peak around 15~eV which even surpasses the photoline for large droplets with $R\gtrsim40$~nm. This peak remains nearly constant in energy for all $h\nu>45~$eV (see SM Fig.~2). Its energy is close to that previously observed in experiments where He droplets were resonantly excited by intense XUV pulses from a free-electron laser (FEL)~\cite{Ovcharenko:2020,LaForge:2021}. There, multiply excited He droplets decayed by ICD according to the reaction $\mathrm{He}^* + \mathrm{He}^* \xrightarrow{} \mathrm{He}^+ + \mathrm{He} + e_\mathrm{ICD}$
occurring in He droplets~\cite{Kuleff:2010}. He$^*$ stands for an excited He atom in the lowest optically accessible excited 1s2s\,$^1$S state. In fact, when we tune $h\nu$ to the strongest resonance of He droplets at $h\nu=21.6$~eV (1s2p\,$^1$P state) in the present synchrotron experiment, we also detect ICD out of the 1s2s\,$^1$S state leading to emission of electrons with kinetic energy around 16.5~eV (cyan line in Fig.~2). Although the photon flux is lower than in FEL experiments by orders of magnitude, large He droplets can still be multiply excited owing to their large resonant absorption cross section (25~Mb for each He atom in the droplet, see SM Sec.~IV and~\cite{BuchtaJCP:2013}). At $h\nu=46.5$~eV, the absorption cross section of He is only 2.3~Mb~\cite{Samson:2002} and excitation of He requires secondary $e$-He inelastic collisions which occurs with probability $<1$. Nevertheless, we detect ICD electrons at $h\nu=46.5$~eV with factor 20 higher rate than at $h\nu=21.6$~eV when taking the $h\nu$-dependent absorption cross section into account. Therefore, we will argue that a different secondary process facilitates the formation of pairs of He$^*$'s as precursors of ICD: Consecutive $e$-He impact excitation and elastic scattering of the slowed electron leads to recombination with its parent ion as depicted in Fig.~3~a). This one-photon process is even more efficient than ICD induced by multiple photon absorption by the droplets under the present conditions. 

To get more detailed insight into this new ICD process we use the electron analyzer to measure ICD electron spectra with much higher resolution than is possible by the VMI technique [red and black lines in Fig.~2 b)]. Clearly, the peak structure is more complex than that for ICD after resonant optical excitation ($h\nu=21.6$~eV, cyan line). There, electrons are mostly produced by decay of pairs of He$^*$'s in the $^1\Sigma_g$ state correlating to two atoms in 1s2s\,$^1$S singlet states~\cite{LaForge:2021}. In contrast, both singlet and triplet states of He $e$-He can be excitated by electron impact. A detailed peak analysis of the new ICD spectra (SM Fig.~3) shows that they mainly contain 7 peaks, where the dominant ones [labeled as A, B, C in Fig.~2 b)] are related to He$^*$'s in the metastable 1s2s\,$^3$S state. The smaller peaks D, E, F only appear at $h\nu >46.6$~eV (SM Fig.~3 c) and are attributed to ICD involving higher-lying states. We ascribe the dominant role of the 1s2s\,$^3$S state to its long lifetime $\sim15~\mu$s~\cite{McKinsey:2003}, whereas all higher excited states rapidly decay by droplet-induced relaxation~\cite{Mudrich:2014,Asmussen:2021} and fluorescence emission, including the 1s2s\,$^1$S state~\cite{keto:1974,Joppien:1993,Haeften:2001,Haeften:2002,PhysRevA.67.062716}. Furthermore, the 1s2s\,$^3$S and higher triplet states are populated by autoionization and recombination of 1s$n$s-excited states with $n\geq 3$~\cite{Haeften:1997}.

We conclude that this new type of indirect ICD is a slow process involving the following steps: (i) Photoionization followed by photoelectron impact excitation of neutral He, hence formation of He$^*$, (ii) multiple elastic $e$-He scattering and electron-ion recombination, (iii) electronic relaxation of the two He$^*$'s to the lowest excited (mostly triplet) states~\cite{Mudrich:2020,Asmussen:2021}, and (iv) ejection of the He$^*$'s to the droplet surface where they roam until two He$^*$'s encounter and decay by ICD~\cite{Buchenau:1991}. This multistep ICD process is schematically represented in Fig.~3 a). Absorption of two photons by the droplets followed by electron impact excitation and ICD contributes to some extent [Fig.~3 b)].

Additional decay channels are ICD involving He$_2^*$ excimers formed by association of He$^*$'s with neighboring groundstate He atoms and ICD involving He$^*$ in highly excited Rydberg states. These processes appear in the electron spectra of Fig.~2 a) around 10~eV and 19.6~eV, respectively. The latter is only active near the electron-impact excitation threshold ($h\nu=44.5$-$46.5$~eV, see SM Fig.~4), where $e$-He$^+$ recombination occurs at very low electron energy. Direct evidence for ICD where a He$_2^*$ excimer relaxes to the groundstate and a neighboring He$^*$ or He$_2^*$ is ionized is obtained from electron and ion VMI's recorded in coincidence with ions and electrons, respectively [see SM Fig.~5].

Our assertion of the essential role of the new one-photon-induced indirect ICD process is further confirmed by measurements of the ICD electron yield as a function of the intensity of radiation, see SM Fig.~7. At $h\nu=46.5$~eV we find a power-law dependence with exponent $\alpha=1.0$ indicating single-photon absorption, whereas for resonant two-photon excitation per droplet at $h\nu$=$21.0$~eV we find $\alpha=1.3$. At $h\nu=50$~eV, $\alpha=1.15$ indicating that both one- and two-photon absorption contributes to the ICD signal.

The inset shows the real-space trajectory projected onto the $xy$-plane; the red circle indicates the (frozen) position of the photoion from where the electron is emitted and which it recombines with at the end of the trajectory.}
\end{figure}

To further establish the multistep mechanism leading to indirect ICD, we performed 3D classical Monte-Carlo trajectory simulations (MCT) of electron propagation inside the He nanodroplets. Binary elastic and inelastic collisions are taken into account according to the known differential cross sections~\cite{Register:1980,Ralchenko:2008}. For details see SM Sec.~IV and V. Fig.~3~c) shows the evolution of the total electron energy along three selected trajectories. When the electron undergoes only elastic scattering, it rapidly reaches the droplet surface and escapes with insignificant loss of energy (blue line). However, given the atomic density of He droplets close to that of bulk superfluid He (0.022~\AA$^{-3}$), the electron has a high probability of undergoing an $e$-He inelastic collision after about 10~fs, thereby suddenly losing $\geq20.6$~eV of its kinetic energy [black and red lines, step (1)]. Subsequently, the electron undergoes multiple elastic collisions with He atoms (2) which leads to a slow, friction-like damping within about 10~ps. Despite the large mismatch of electron mass and He atomic mass (1/7300), the resulting diffusion-like electron motion can be fully stopped given the large sizes of He droplets $R>20$~nm we consider here. In this case it is eventually drawn back to its parent He$^+$ ion via Coulomb attraction and recombines with it (3) after about 100~ps (red line). Note that these values are in good agreement with previous findings for bulk liquid He~\cite{McKinsey:2003}. The inset shows the projection of the trajectory leading to recombination onto the $xy$-plane. Time after ionization is encoded in the line color. Trajectories where two He$^*$'s are formed in one droplet by electron impact and by recombination to the 1s2s\,$^3$S state are counted as ICD events.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Fig4.pdf}\caption{\label{fig4} Simulated and experimental yields of ICD electrons in proportion to photoelectrons as a function of $h\nu$ for He droplets of radius $R=50$~nm.

The vertical purple dashed line indicates the He electron impact excitation threshold at $h\nu = 44.4$~eV.}
\end{figure}

The simulated numbers of ICD events following one- and two-photon ionization in proportion to the number of directly emitted electrons are shown in Fig.~4 as blue, orange and cyan dashed lines, respectively, for a He droplet of size $R=50$~nm and for $h\nu$'s tuned across the He impact excitation threshold (see details in SM Sec.~IV). They are summed (black dashed lines in Fig.~4) and compared to the experimental ICD rate normalized to the rate of detected photoelectrons (red solid line). To reproduce the sharp ICD peak around $h\nu = 46.5$~eV, He electron impact excitation energies are shifted by 0.84~eV with respect to atomic-level energies. This shift is consistent with blue-shifts of excited states observed in optical and $e$-He impact excitation spectra~\cite{Joppien:1993,Shcherbinin:2019}.
The best fit of the simulated and experimental data is obtained when scaling down the channels leading to ICD, electron impact excitation followed by $e$-He$^+$ recombination (blue dashed lines in Fig.~4) and electron impact ionization followed by recombination of the two emerging electrons (orange dashed lines in Fig.~4) by factors 0.3 and 0.1, respectively (see SM Sec.~IV).

Overall, the simulation confirms our interpretation that ICD is mainly initiated by one-photon ionization. At $h\nu=45$-$53$~eV, impact excitation of He by the photoelectron and $e$-He$^+$ recombination is the main pathway to ICD. At $h\nu$ $\gtrsim$ 53~eV, the electron impact-ionization cross section exceeds those for electron impact-excitation and recombination of two electrons dominates. At $h\nu>65.4$~eV (not shown), multiple electron impact excitation and ionization can generate two He$^*$'s in a droplet thereby further enhancing ICD. Two-photon absorption causing the photoemission of two electrons which both impact excite He$^*$'s in the same droplet only plays a minor role in this droplet size range 5-75~nm but may become important for larger droplets and higher radiation intensities~\cite{Ovcharenko:2014,Ovcharenko:2020}. 

We point out that this type of ICD is not restricted to pure He droplets; in He droplets doped with lithium (Li) atoms, ICD also occurs between a He$^*$ and a Li atom thereby creating a Li$^+$ ion and an ICD electron~\cite{Ltaief:2019}. The yield of Li$^+$ ions produced in this way at $h\nu>44.4$~eV follows essentially the same $h\nu$ dependence [see SM Fig.~8], highlighting the relevance of this ICD mechanism also for heterogeneous systems.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Fig5.pdf}\caption{\label{fig5} Experimental vs. simulated yields of ICD electrons normalized to all electrons as a function of He droplet radius $R$ at $h\nu = 46.5$~eV.}
\end{figure}

In conclusion, in large He droplets irradiated by XUV light at $h\nu\gtrsim44.4$~eV, ICD of pairs of He$^*$'s formed by electron impact and by electron-ion recombination is an important relaxation mechanism generating electrons with characteristic energy $\approx 15$~eV. High-resolution electron spectra reveal that mainly the lowest metastable excited state of He contributes, indicating that higher-lying states relax radiatively and non-radiatively prior to ICD. This sets the timescale for this type of ICD to nanoseconds or even longer.
For droplet radii $R\gtrsim 40$~nm, ICD even becomes the dominant electron emission channel. Fig.~5 shows the experimental and simulated (see SM Sec. IV) yields of ICD electrons normalized to the sum of all detected electrons as a function of $R$. Starting at $R\approx5$~nm, both experimental and simulated ICD electron yields monotonously rise and reach a value of about 0.65 at $R=75$~nm. We refrain from analyzing larger droplets as more complex processes will contribute such as multi-photon absorption (cyan curve in Fig.~5), shadowing, nanofocusing~\cite{ban2020photoemission}, and trapping of electrons at the droplet surface~\cite{Farnik:1998}. Future studies should aim at studying the dynamics of this indirect ICD~\cite{LaForge:2021,Ziemkiewicz:2015} and quantifying the role of competing fluorescence decay channels~\cite{Haeften:2023}. Comparative studies of other condensed-phase systems should be done to confirm the general relevance of this type of ICD for generating slow electrons, which can cause radiation damage in biological matter~\cite{Alizadeh:2015}.

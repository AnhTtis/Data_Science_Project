SRMCF is \nWe investigate renormalized mean curvature flow (RMCF) and stochastic renormalized mean curvature flow (SRMCF) for convex sets in the plane. RMCF is the inverse gradient flow for logarithm of $σ/λ^2$ where $σ$ is the perimeter and $λ$ is the volume. SRMCF is RMCF perturbated by some Brownian noise and has the remarkable property that it can be intertwined with Brownian motion, yielding a generalization of Pitman \"$2M-X$\" theorem. We prove that along RMCF, entropy $\\mathcal{E}_t$ for curvature as well as $h_t:=σ_t/λ_t$ are non-increasing. We deduce infinite lifetime and convergence to a disk after normalization. For SRMCF the situation is more complicated. As $h_t$ is always a supermartingale, for $\\mathcal{E}_t$ to be a supermartingale, we need that the starting set is invariant by the isometry group $G_n$ generated by the reflection with respect to the vertical line and the rotation of angle $2π/n$, for some $n\\ge 3$. But for proving infinite lifetime, we need invariance of the starting set by $G_n$ for some $n\\ge 7$. We provide the first SRMCF with infinite lifetime which cannot be reduced to a finite dimensional flow. Gage inequality plays a major role in our study of the regularity of flows, as well as a careful investigation of morphological skeletons. We characterize symmetric convex sets with star shaped skeletons in terms of properties of their Gauss map. Finally, we establish a new isoperimetric estimate for these sets, of order $1/n^4$ where $n$ is the number of branches of the skeleton.",

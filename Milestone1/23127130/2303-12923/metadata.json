    "abstract": "We provide a definition of a $\\prec$-asymptotic pair in a topological action of a countable group $G$, where $\\prec$ is an order on $G$ of type $\\mathbb Z$. We then prove that if $G$ is a countable amenable group and $(X,G)$ is a topological $G$-action of positive entropy, then for every multiorder $(\\tilde{\\mathcal O},ν,G)$ and $ν$-almost every order $\\prec\\,\\in\\tilde{\\mathcal O}$ there exists a $\\prec$-asympotic pair in $X$. This result is a generalization of the Blanchard-Host-Ruette Theorem for classical topological dynamical systems (actions of~$\\mathbb Z$). We also prove that for every countable amenable group $G$, and every multiorder on $G$ arising from a tiling system, every topological $G$-action of entropy zero has an extension which has no $\\prec$-asymptotic pairs for any $\\prec$ belonging to this multiorder. Together, these two theorems give a characterization of topological $G$-actions of entropy zero: $(X,G)$ has topological entropy zero if and only if, for any multiorder $\\tilde{\\mathcal O}_{\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf T}}$ on $G$ arising from a tiling system of entropy zero, there exists an extension $(Y,G)$ of $(X,G)$, which has no $\\prec$-asymptotic pairs for any $\\prec\\,\\in\\tilde{\\mathcal O}_{\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf T}}$, equivalently, there exists a multiorder $(\\tilde{\\mathcal O},ν,G)$ on $G$, such that for $ν$-almost any $\\prec\\,\\in\\tilde{\\mathcal O}$, there are no $\\prec$-asymptotic pairs in $(Y,G)$.",

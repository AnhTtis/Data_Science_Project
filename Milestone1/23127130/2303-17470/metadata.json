    "abstract": "Competing short- and long-range interactions represent distinguished ingredients for the formation of complex quantum many-body phases. In this regard, Rydberg atoms are promising as their excited manifold of states have both density-density and exchange interactions whose strength and range can vary considerably. Focusing on one-dimensional systems, we leverage the van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions of the Rydberg atoms to obtain the zero-temperature phase diagram for a uniform chain and a dimer model. For the uniform chain, we can influence the boundaries between ordered phases and Luttinger liquid while for the dimerized case, a new type of bond-order-density-wave phase is identified, all of which highlights the versatility of the Rydberg platform in studying physics involving short- and long-ranged interactions simultaneously.",

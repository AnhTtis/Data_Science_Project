\begin{abstract}
We argue that, in a basis common to all one-site shift invariant  conserved charges, there is no eigenstate of a noninteracting local spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain Hamiltonian that satisfies the area law if the ground state has half-integer central charge.
That is to say, in those models all (quasi)local one-site shift invariant conserved operators are gapless. From the standpoint of  bipartite entanglement properties, we show indeed that
there are three distinct one-site shift invariant noninteracting models, two of which are  equivalent  to the XX model (for one of them the transformation breaks one-site shift invariance) and the other to the critical Ising model. The former class has two locally distinct one-site shift invariant excited states satisfying the area law; the latter two classes have none.

The ground states of shift-invariant spin-chain systems with gapped local Hamiltonians are low entangled: the entropy of a block of spins has only a subleading dependence on the block's length~\cite{Hastings2007An}. This is known as ``area law'' and applies to systems in higher dimensions as well~\cite{Eisert2010Colloquium}. In 1D the area law generally breaks down at quantum phase transitions, where the entropy of a spin block can develop a logarithmic dependence on its length~\cite{Calabrese2009Entanglement}. In contrast, excited states are expected to follow a volume law~\cite{Hayden2006Aspects}: the entropy of a block of spins is proportional to the block's length. Exceptions to this rule (nearly) define the so-called quantum many-body scars~\cite{Serbyn2021Quantum}, which are excited states with (generally) anomalously low bipartite entanglement. Integrable systems are quite exceptional in this respect, as they exhibit infinitely many excited states with sub-extensive entropies and  energies that are extensively larger than the ground state one~\cite{Alba2009Entanglement,Beugeling2015Global}. This is a direct consequence of the existence of infinitely many local conservation laws, indeed the ground state of any conserved charge with fast enough decaying interactions is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian with sub-extensive bipartite entanglement. 
Both the typical properties of excited states~\cite{Alba2009Entanglement,Bhattacharya2013,Wong2013,Palmai2014Excited, Molter2014Bound,Ares2015,Beugeling2015Global,Lai2015Entanglement,Alba2015Eigenstate,Keating2015,Lev2017Entanglement,Lev2017Entanglement1,Sanjay2018,Lev2018Volume,Mestyan2018Renyi,Moessner.Haque2018,Hackl2019Average,Murthy2019Structure,LeBlond2019,Murciano2019,Levine2019,Lu2019Renyi,Moitra2020,LydZba2020Eigenstate,Angel-Ramelli2021,Miao2021Eigenstate,Miao2022Eigenstate,Haque2022Entanglement,Bianchi2022Volume,Buividovich2022unpublished,Yu2023Free} and the critical properties of low-entangled ones~\cite{Alcaraz2011Entanglement,Berganza2012Entanglement, Storms2014Entanglement,Herwerth2015Excited,Jafarizadeh2019Bipartite, Zhang2021Corrections, Zhang2022Entanglement} have attracted some attention.
How many locally different excited states satisfy however the area law? This is a tricky, somewhat ill-defined question that has been either overlooked or addressed just incidentally and/or carelessly. 
On one hand, the answer could depend on the basis chosen to diagonalise the Hamiltonian and degeneracies could also be sensitive to the system's size. On the other hand, the choice of the basis can be physical, for example, in investigations into the stationary behaviour of observables when the system is prepared in some nonequilibrium initial state. %; and the question of whether a gapped local conserved charge exists could become relevant to understand the late-time behaviour. 
That was our very motivation for starting this investigation. We have indeed observed algebraic decay of connected correlations at late times after preparing a critical Ising chain in one-site shift invariant (``\shift{1}'' in the following) states satisfying the area law. 
Algebraic decay could be  expected when the initial state is critical or when it has sharp inhomogeneities~\cite{Maric2022Universality,Maric2023Universality}, but it is otherwise unusual: critical low-temperature properties of the Hamiltonian are generally irrelevant at late times, in that, if  gapped conserved charges exist, the Hamiltonian could be replaced by (almost) any of them without affecting the stationary behaviour of observables. What is then so special in the excited states of the critical Ising model?
%in integrable systems there are privileged bases that allow for a systematic description, more or less independent of  chain's length and accidental degeneracies. 
In \shift{1} noninteracting spin chains that are mapped to free fermions by a Jordan-Wigner transformation, such as the quantum Ising model, a relevant basis of excited states consists of \shift{1} Slater determinants for the Jordan-Wigner fermions. 
%Ref.~\cite{Jafarizadeh2019Bipartite} has recently suggested that, in free fermionic systems, one should generally expect infinitely many locally different excited states satisfying the area law, as well as infinitely many states breaking the area law as ground states of conformal systems with half-integer and/or integer central charges. While the physical arguments provided sound convincing, we show here that the picture could be quite different. 
In any such excited state, the bipartite entanglement entropies can be easily computed numerically, and the entropies of large subsystems can be predicted on the basis of the asymptotic behaviours of determinants of Toeplitz and block-Toeplitz matrices~\cite{Its2009The}, which have been thoroughly investigated (see, e.g.,  Refs~\cite{Deift2011Asymptotics,Basor2017Asymptotics}). This opportunity is definitely rare and has already been  exploited to quantify the picture summarised above~\cite{Alba2009Entanglement,Ares2014,Jafarizadeh2019Bipartite}. 
In particular, it was shown that there are infinitely many excited states that can be described by zero-temperature conformal field theories (CFTs) with half-integer or integer central charges. More vague are the statements about excited states satisfying the area law. %For example, a recent investigation~\cite{Jafarizadeh2019Bipartite} into the bipartite entropies of excited states in free fermionic chains gives the impression 
It looks like there is a common belief that one should expect infinitely many states of that kind. We point out here that the picture is quite different. Specifically, only a finite number of locally different excited states seem to satisfy the area law, and there are notable cases, such as the critical Ising model, where there are none. 
%Before expanding on that, we need an effective definition of area law for excited states. Though generally convenient, taking the thermodynamic 
%limit in this case could be unfeasible: while the definition of ground state is independent of the chain's length $L$,  the number of excited states increases exponentially with $L$, hence the sequence of excited states (labelled by $L$) that one would like to associate with a given macrostate in the thermodynamic limit is ambiguous. In these notes we use the following definitions (for spin chains):
%\begin{definition}
%There is at least one excited state satisfying the area law if and only if there are sequences of excited states  (enumerated by $L$) in which the entropy of any spin block has an upper bound independent of both the block's length and $L$.  
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}
%Two sequences of excited states satisfying the area law are locally different if they can be distinguished by the expectation value of a local observable for arbitrarily large $L$. 
%\end{definition}
We argue that this no-go theorem applies to every noninteracting \shift{1} local Hamiltonian with a critical ground state described by a CFT with half-integer central charge. 
%conversely, if the critical ground state is described by a conformal field theory with integer central charge, there are always two locally distinct excited states satisfying the area law.
We show it in two steps. First, we explicitly study the XX model~(XX)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:XX}
\bs H_{\textsc{xx}}=J\sum\nolimits_\ell\bs\sigma_\ell^x\bs\sigma_{\ell+1}^x+\bs\sigma_\ell^y\bs\sigma_{\ell+1}^y\, ,
\end{equation}
the critical Ising model (CI)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CI}
\bs H_{\textsc{ci}}=-J\sum\nolimits_\ell\bs\sigma_\ell^x\bs\sigma_{\ell+1}^x+\bs\sigma_\ell^z\, ,
\end{equation}
and the strongly anisotropic XY model (X-X)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:X-X}
\bs H_{\textsc{x-x}}=J\sum\nolimits_\ell\bs\sigma_\ell^x\bs\sigma_{\ell+1}^x-\bs\sigma_\ell^y\bs\sigma_{\ell+1}^y\, .
\end{equation}
We aver that, among them, only the XX model has eigenstates satisfying the area law (in the \shift{1} basis); and no excited state  is described by a CFT with half-integer central charge.
We then prove that every \shift{1} noninteracting Hamiltonian can be mapped into a \shift{1} conservation law of XX, CI, or \mbox{X-X}   by a discrete and/or a continuous local unitary transformation. Such transformations do not affect the asymptotic dependency of the bipartite entropies on the subsystem's length, hence the generality of our findings.

\paragraph*{Noninteracting spin chains.}
We consider a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain with $L$ sites described by a generic \shift{1} Hamiltonian (with periodic boundary conditions) 
that can be mapped to free fermions by a Jordan-Wigner transformation $\bs a_{2\ell-1}=\prod_{j<\ell}\bs\sigma_j^z \bs\sigma_\ell^x$, $\bs a_{2\ell}=\prod_{j<\ell}\bs\sigma_j^z \bs\sigma_\ell^y$, where $\bs a_j$ are Majorana fermions ($\{\bs a_i,\bs a_j\}=2\delta_{i j}$) which in the following will be imagined as sitting on pseudo-sites ($j$ in $\bs a_j)$.  
The excited states, $\ket{\{p\}}$, split in two sectors, usually called Ramond (+) and Neveu-Schwarz (-), differing only in the quantization conditions satisfied by the momenta $p$ of the excitations: $e^{iL p}=1$ in Ramond and $e^{iL p}=-1$ in Neveu-Schwarz. 
An excited state is in Ramond if $\prod_{j=1}^L\bs\sigma_\ell^z\ket{\{p\}}=-\ket{\{p\}}$ and in  Neveu-Schwarz  if $\prod_{j=1}^L\bs\sigma_\ell^z\ket{\{p\}}=\ket{\{p\}}$; 
in the fermionic picture it is an eigenstate of a quadratic form of fermions $\bs H^\pm=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{\ell,n}\bs a_\ell\mathcal H^\pm_{\ell n}\bs a_n$ with periodic ($+$) or anti-periodic ($-$) boundary conditions (i.e., $\mathcal H^+$ is block circulant and $\mathcal H^-$ block anti-circulant), respectively.
As such, each excited state is fully characterised by the fermionic two-point correlations, which are customarily organised in a matrix $\Gamma_{\{p\}}=\mathrm I-\braket{\{p\}|\bs a\otimes \bs a|\{p\}}$, known as correlation matrix. 
Translational invariance makes it convenient to work in the Fourier space.  
We refer the reader to Ref.~\cite{Fagotti2016Charges} for a review of some free-fermion techniques; here we only list some useful  well-known results.  
The $2$-by-$2$ block-Fourier transform (aka symbol) $\hat \Gamma^{(2)}(k)$ of a correlation matrix $\Gamma$ is $2\pi$-periodic and satisfies $\hat \Gamma^{(2)}(k)=[\hat \Gamma^{(2)}(k)]^\dag=-[\hat \Gamma^{(2)}(-k)]^t$ (by the fermionic algebra)~\footnote{We are defining a block-Fourier transform rather than a simple Fourier transform because there are two Majorana fermions per site.}. Restricting to excited states, $\hat \Gamma^{(2)}_{\{p\}}(k)$
can be written in terms of the block-Fourier transform $\hat{\mathcal H}^{(2)}(k)$ of $\mathcal H^\pm$ as follows. First, $\hat \Gamma^{(2)}_{\{p\}}(k)$ commutes with the symbol of the Hamiltonian $\hat{\mathcal H}^{(2)}(k)$ and, for given $k$, has eigenvalues $\pm 1$;
%takes the form 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:Gamma2k}
%\hat \Gamma^{(2)}_{\{p\}}(k)=-\mathcal U^{(2)}(k)\Sigma^{(2)}_{\{p\}}(k)\mathcal U^{(2)\dag} (k)\, ,
%\end{equation}
%where $\Sigma^{(2)}_{\{p\}}(k)$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal to $\pm 1$ and $\mathcal U^{(2)}(k)$ diagonalises the symbol of the Hamiltonian
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:H2k}
%\hat{\mathcal H}^{(2)}(k)=\mathcal U^{(2)}(k)\mathcal E^{(2)}(k)\mathcal U^{(2)\dag} (k)\, .
%\end{equation}
%We point out that the particular size of the blocks (i.e., $2$, which we have specified as a superscript in the matrix functions) is related to considering one-site shift invariant Hamiltonians (there are two Majorana fermions per site), but \eqref{eq:Gamma2k} and \eqref{eq:H2k} are in fact independent of the block's size.
each choice of eigenvalues corresponds to a different excited state, and, in particular, for the ground state we have $
\hat \Gamma^{(2)}_{\textsc{gs}}(k)=-\mathrm{sgn}(\hat{\mathcal H}^{(2)}(k))
$.
Second, in the basis diagonalising $\hat{\mathcal H}^{(2)}(k)$ in such a way that the first eigenvalue is identified with the excitation energy $\varepsilon(k)$ (and the second is, in turn, $-\varepsilon(-k)$), adding an excitation with momentum $\bar p$ to $\ket{\{p\}}$ ($\bar p\notin \{p\}$) has a double effect~\footnote{Note that only an even number of excitations preserves the sector.}: $\Sigma_{\{p\}\cup \{\bar p\}}(\pm \bar p)= \mp \sigma^z \Sigma_{\{p\}}(\pm \bar p)$, where $\Sigma_{\{p\}\cup \{\bar p\}}(\pm \bar p)$ is the diagonal matrix equivalent to the symbol of the correlation matrix (see also Ref.~\cite{Alba2009Entanglement}).

\paragraph*{Entanglement entropies.}
The entanglement properties of a bipartition $A\cup \overline A$ in a pure state can be measured by the von Neumann entropy $S_1(A)=-\mathrm{tr}[\rho_A\log \rho_A]$~\cite{Bennett1996Concentrating}, or, more generally, by the R\'enyi entropies $S_\alpha(A)=\log\mathrm{tr}[\rho_A^\alpha]/(1-\alpha)$~\cite{Renyi1970Probability}. 
Let $\bs O_A$ be an observable acting nontrivially only in a connected subsystem $A$. By the Wick's theorem, its expectation value in an excited state $\ket{\{p\}}$ %of the natural basis discussed above  
can be expressed in terms of the submatrix $\Gamma_{\{p\},A}$ of $\Gamma_{\{p\}}$ corresponding to restricting the indices to the sites in $A$.  
$A$'s correlation matrix $\Gamma_{\{p\},A}$ is in turn block-Toeplitz  with symbol $\hat\Gamma_{\{p\}}^{(2)}(k)$. From now on we use the notation $\mathrm T_{N}^{(n)}$ to indicate $(nN)$-by-$(nN)$ block-Toeplitz matrices with $n$-by-$n$ blocks.
Several representations of the R\'enyi entropies of a spin block $A$ in terms of $\Gamma_{\{p\},A}$ are known. Here we use a formula that can be argued from the Euclidean approach to the R\'enyi entropies in free quantum field theories~\cite{Casini2009Entanglement,Maric2023Universality}
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:Salpharep}
%S_\alpha(A)=\sum_{j=0}^{\alpha-1}\tfrac{\log\det\bigl|\sin(\frac{\pi(j+\frac{1}{2})}{\alpha})\mathrm I-i \cos(\frac{\pi(j+\frac{1}{2})}{\alpha})\Gamma|_A\bigr|}{2(1-\alpha)}\, ,
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Salpharep}
S_\alpha(A)=\sum_{j=0}^{\alpha-1}\frac{\log\det\bigl|\varrho_{|A|}^{(2)}(\frac{\pi(j+\frac{1}{2})}{\alpha})\bigr|}{2(1-\alpha)}\, ,
\end{equation}
where $\varrho_{|A|}^{(2)}(\phi)$ has the 2-by-2 symbol
\begin{equation}
\hat \varrho^{(2)}(k;\phi)=\sin\phi\mathrm I_2-i \cos\phi\hat \Gamma_{\{p\}}^{(2)}(k)\, .%\\
%e^{2i\alpha\phi}=-1\qquad e^{i L k}=\pm 1\, .
\end{equation} 
%which clearly shows that the entanglement of spin blocks is completely characterised by the family of symbols
%$
%\begin{gathered}
%\hat S(k;\phi)=\sin(\phi)\mathrm I-i \cos(\phi)\hat \Gamma(k)%\\
%e^{2i\alpha\phi}=-1\qquad e^{i L k}=\pm 1\, .
%\end{gathered}
%$
%and 
This allows us to carry out a qualitative analysis of bipartite entanglement without specifying the R\'enyi index~$\alpha$.  
Before starting on it, we warn the reader that the entanglement properties of excited states could become basis dependent especially in superintegrable (aka non-Abelian integrable) systems, such as the quantum XY model in zero field~\cite{Fagotti2014On}, or in integrable systems with Hilbert-space fragmentation~\cite{Moudgalya2022Hilbert}, such as the dual folded XXZ model~\cite{Zadnik2021The}, in which there are exponentially large degenerate sectors spanned by low-entangled states. 
In our case degeneracies can be originated by  the symmetries of the dispersion relation % , e.g.,  $|\varepsilon(k)|=|\varepsilon(-k)|$ or $|\varepsilon(k)|=|\varepsilon(\pi-k)|$, 
or by accidental equivalences of multi-particle energies.  
Generally, both kinds of degeneracies can be lifted by adding a \shift{1} conservation law to the Hamiltonian and/or by changing the chain's length. This selects a natural \shift{1} basis of excited states. %, which we ask to be common to all the \shift{1} conserved charges. 

Our first step will be an analytical study, which is mainly a reorganisation of results that are already known or that can be readily derived from what is  known. 
\paragraph*{XX model.}
The XX model has the $U(1)$ symmetry of rotations about $z$, i.e., the Hamiltonian commutes with $\bs S^z=\frac{1}{2}\sum_\ell\bs\sigma_\ell^z$. This is enough to conclude that there are at least two locally different excited states satisfying the area law: $\ket{\cdots \uparrow\uparrow\cdots}$ and $\ket{\cdots \downarrow\downarrow\cdots}$. Our  goal in this case is to establish that any other state of that kind is locally equivalent to one or to the other.  Let us start by writing the symbol of the correlation matrix in $\ket{\{p\}}$:
\begin{equation}
\hat \Gamma_{\{p\}}^{(2)}(k)=\tfrac{\hat \Sigma_{\{p\}}^{(1)}(k)-\hat \Sigma^{(1)}_{\{p\}}(-k)}{2}\mathrm I_2+\tfrac{\hat \Sigma^{(1)}_{\{p\}}(k)+\hat \Sigma^{(1)}_{\{p\}}(-k)}{2}\sigma^y\, ,
\end{equation}
where $\hat \Sigma^{(1)}_{\{p\}}(k)\in\{-1,1\}$ and, in particular, $\hat \Sigma^{(1)}_{\emptyset}(k)=-\mathrm{sgn}(\cos k)$.
The simple structure of the symbol is translated into a simple structure of the correlation matrix, which allows one to express the entropies as determinants of $|A|$-by-$|A|$ Toeplits matrices: % with symbols $\sin\phi +i\cos\phi \Sigma_{\{p\}}(k)$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logdetXX}
\det\varrho_A(\phi)=\Bigl|\det\bigl|\sin\phi\mathrm I_{|A|}+i \cos\phi\Sigma_{|A|}^{(1)}\bigr|\Bigr|^2\, ,
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%S_\alpha(A)=\sum_{\phi_\alpha}\tfrac{\log\bigl|\det\bigl|\sin(\frac{\pi(j+\frac{1}{2})}{\alpha})\mathrm I+i \cos(\frac{\pi(j+\frac{1}{2})}{\alpha})\Sigma|_A\bigr|\bigr|}{2(1-\alpha)}\, ,
%\end{equation}
where $\Sigma_{|A|}^{(1)}$ has symbol $\hat \Sigma^{(1)}_{\{p\}}(k)$. %, and we used the shorthand $\phi_\alpha$ for the sum over all nonequivalent $\phi$ such that $e^{2i\alpha\phi}=-1$ (a factor $1/2$ comes from summing each term twice).
In the thermodynamic limit we can  apply the result proved by Szeg\"o in Ref.~\cite{Szego1920Beitrage}, and obtain the asymtpotic behaviour as $|A|\rightarrow\infty$ %(cf. \eqref{eq:Salpharep})
%\begin{equation}
%\lim_{|A|\rightarrow\infty}\!\!\!\tfrac{S_\alpha(A)}{|A|}=%\\
%\sum_{\phi_\alpha}\int_{-\pi}^\pi\tfrac{\mathrm d k}{2\pi}\tfrac{\log|\sin^2(\phi)+\cos^2(\phi)[\Sigma^{(1)}(k)]^2|}{4(1-\alpha)}\, .
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ext}
\frac{\log\det\varrho_A(\phi)}{|A|}\rightarrow \int_{-\pi}^\pi\frac{\mathrm d k}{2\pi}\log|\sin^2\phi+\cos^2\phi [\hat \Sigma^{(1)}(k)]^2|\, .
\end{equation}
Here we dropped the label $\{p\}$ because now  $\hat \Sigma^{(1)}(k)$ is the symbol of a macrostate, representing infinitely many locally equivalent excited states, and can assume any value in $[-1,1]$.  
The excited states with minimal entropy are sub-extensive and, in turn, %in order for $\hat \Sigma^{(1)}(k)$ to describe the limit of a sequence of excited states satisfying the area law, it should also satisfy {\color{blue} instead of \textit{it should also satisfy}, \textit{
their $\hat \Sigma^{(1)}(k)$ should make the right hand side of \eqref{eq:ext} vanish, that is to say,
$
\hat\Sigma^{(1)}(k)\in\{-1,1\}
$. 
%We stress that, while this is a trivial identity for every excited state with a finite value of $L$, it becomes a nontrivial requirement in the thermodynamic limit, in which $\hat\Sigma^{(1)}(k)$ is supposed to be a function of the continuous variable $k$. 
All sequences of excited states with sub-extensive entropy  are therefore characterised by a piece-wise constant symbol $\hat \Sigma^{(1)}(k)$ with a given number $n$ of discontinuities. If the latter is finite, the discontinuities are simple examples of Fisher-Hartwig singularities~\cite{Basor1983Toeplitz,Deift2011Asymptotics}. Specifically, each discontinuity gives the additive asymptotic contribution $-(\frac{\phi}{\pi}-\frac{1}{2})^2\log|A|$ to $\log \det|\sin\phi\mathrm I_{|A|}+i \cos\phi\Sigma_{|A|}^{(1)}|$ in \eqref{eq:logdetXX}.
The corresponding states behave as ground states of CFTs with integer central charges $\frac{n}{2}$. Their symbol can indeed be reinterpreted as the sign of the symbol of a quasilocal quadratic form of fermions and vice versa. 
The area law can be satisfied only if there are no discontinuities at all, i.e., $\hat \Sigma^{(1)}(k)=\pm 1$. These are 
the symbols of the states that are locally equivalent to $\ket{\cdots \uparrow\uparrow\cdots}$ and $\ket{\cdots \downarrow\downarrow\cdots}$. %, which are the low-entangled states that we already identified. 
Consequently, the ground state of any gapped conservation law with exponentially decaying interactions is either $\ket{\cdots \uparrow\uparrow\cdots}$ or $\ket{\cdots \downarrow\downarrow\cdots}$.
It can also be argued that there should not be exceptions in the presence of infinitely many discontinuities in the symbol, as the bipartite entanglement tends to increase with their number (such states can also be interpreted as ground states of long-range Hamiltonians~\cite{Gori2015Explicit}) --- see also \mbox{\textsc{sm}--\ref{SM:lower}}. %Fermionic correlations would indeed nevertheless decay more slowly than exponential, manifesting the local difference with and there is no unitary transformation preserving local properties and mapping the state into one with finite correlation lengths. 
%A way to see it is that $2\pi$-periodic functions with infinitely many zeros can not be smooth, hence a symbol of that kind does not correspond to a Hamiltonian with exponentially decreasing interactions. %: if such an eigenstate satisfying the area law  existed, it could not be interpreted as the ground state of a quasilocal (noninteracting) Hamiltonian. 
%Such a hypothetical state would then be in a topologically nontrivial phase, protected by the absence of interactions (which includes a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry).  
%...
%This is however not expected in 1D because there is no topological order and every state satisfying the area law can be mapped into one another by a quasilocal unitary transformation\footnote{In principle, we should restrict to quadratic transformations, which require in particular a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry}.


\paragraph*{Critical Ising model.}
The critical Ising model is special as $\mathcal H^\pm$ is not only antisymmetric block-\mbox{(anti)circulant}, but it is  antisymmetric \mbox{(anti)circulant} (antisymmetry manifests the fermionic algebra). 
This property can be almost directly translated to the correlation matrices of the excited states. There is only a subtlety due to the 2-fold degeneracy of the eigenstates in the Ramond sector, which break the invariance under one pseudo-shift --- see \textsc{sm}--\ref{SM:zero}. Since our search for states satisfying the area law is not affected by this issue, when needed, we will consider the incoherent superposition of the two degenerate states, which is described by a circulant matrix $\Gamma^{(1)}$ with symbol $\hat \Gamma^{(1)}_{\{p\}}(k)\in \{-1,1\}$ for $k\neq 0,\pi$ and $\hat \Gamma^{(1)}(0)=\hat \Gamma^{(1)}(\pi)=0$. 
We then have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:varrhoCI}
\det\varrho_A(\phi)=\det\bigl|\sin\phi\mathrm I_{2|A|}+i \cos\phi\Gamma_{2|A|}^{(1)}\bigr|\, .
\end{equation}
In the thermodynamic limit the Szeg\"o lemma gives
%\begin{equation}
%\lim_{|A|\rightarrow\infty}\!\!\!\tfrac{S_\alpha(A)}{|A|}=%\\
%\sum_{\phi_\alpha}\int_{-\pi}^\pi\tfrac{\mathrm d k}{2\pi}\tfrac{\log|\sin^2(\phi)+\cos^2(\phi)[\Gamma^{(1)}(k)]^2|}{4(1-\alpha)}
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\log\det\varrho_A(\phi)}{|A|}\rightarrow \int_{-\pi}^\pi\frac{\mathrm d k}{2\pi}\log|\sin^2\phi+\cos^2\phi [\hat \Gamma^{(1)}(k)]^2|,
\end{equation}
which matches the expression for the XX model provided that  $\Sigma^{(1)}(k)$ is replaced by $\Gamma^{(1)}(k)$. 
The qualitative analysis is therefore almost identical. The unique but important deviation comes from the fact that, while $\Sigma^{(1)}(k)$ could be any function with image in $[-1,1]$, $\Gamma^{(1)}(k)$ is forced to be odd by the fermionic algebra. Consequently, the smallest number of discontinuities in the symbol is $2$ (one at $k=0$ and one at $k=\pi$) and corresponds to the ground state or to the state with maximal energy. These states break the area law with a logarithmic term corresponding to a CFT with central charge $\frac{1}{2}$. Contrary to the XX model, there is no excited state satisfying the area law that can be interpreted as the ground state of a quasilocal Hamiltonian, that is to say, every quasilocal conservation law of the critical Ising model is gapless. 
As also observed in Ref.~\cite{Jafarizadeh2019Bipartite}, we find that the central charges of the CFTs describing the low-entangled excited states of CI can be both half-integer and (nonzero) integer. 
\paragraph*{X-X model.}
The X-X model, described by Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:X-X}, is equivalent to the XX model, indeed $\bs H_{\textsc{X-X}}=\bs\Pi^{zy} \bs H_{\textsc{XX}} \bs\Pi^{zy}$, where $\bs\Pi^{zy}=\prod_{j}\bs\sigma_{2j-1}^z\bs\sigma_{2j-1}^y$. The similarity transformation, however, breaks one-site shift invariance, hence only the \shift{1} charges of the XX model that are even under $\bs\Pi^{zy}$ are mapped to \shift{1} charges of the X-X model. The remaining \shift{1} charges of X-X correspond to conservation laws of $XX$ that break one-site shift invariance into a two-site one, whose existence was established in Ref.~\cite{Fagotti2014On}. Thus, we are  forced to treat the X-X model  independently of the XX one. 

The symbol of the correlation matrix in $\ket{\{p\}}$ reads
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\{p\}}^{(2)}(k)=\tfrac{\hat \omega_{+,\{p\}}(k)+\hat \omega_{-,\{p\}}(k)}{2}\mathrm I+\tfrac{\hat \omega_{+,\{p\}}(k)-\hat \omega_{-,\{p\}}(k)}{2}\sigma^x%+\\
%(s_0 \delta_{k 0}+s_\pi \delta_{k \pi})\sigma^y\, ,
\end{equation}
where $\hat \omega_{s,\{p\}}(k)\in \{-1,1\}$ are odd in $k$~\footnote{Just as we did in CI, so we are overlooking  the zero energy modes $k=0,\pi$, which would give a contribution $s_0 \delta_{k 0}+s_\pi \delta_{k \pi})\sigma^y$ --- see \textsc{sm}--\ref{SM:zero}.}.  %and $s_0,s_\pi\in \{-1,1\}$ parametrize the ambiguity in the zero energy modes $k=0,\pi$. For large $L$, $s_{0,\pi}$ become irrelevant, hence 
We can again effectively decompose the block-Toeplitz matrix so as to express the entropies in terms of determinants of Toeplitz matrices
\begin{equation}
\det\varrho_A(\phi)= \prod_{s=\pm 1}\det\bigl|\sin\phi\mathrm I_{|A|}+i \cos\phi\omega_{s,|A|}^{(1)}\bigr|\, .
\end{equation}
The right hand side is the product of two determinants of the Ising kind~\eqref{eq:varrhoCI}, therefore %, neglecting the zero energy modes, 
the entanglement entropies are  the sum of the entropies of two excited states of the Ising model. The absence of a state satisfying the area law in the critical Ising model implies in turn the same in the X-X model. %In addition, we can also infer that the low-entangled states are described by conformal field theories with integer central charge. 
%and we can again decompose the block-Toeplitz matrix in such a way to express \eqref{eq:Salpharep} in terms of determinants of Toeplitz matrices as follows 
%\begin{equation}
%\lim_{|A|\rightarrow\infty}\!\!\!\tfrac{S_\alpha(A)}{|A|}=\sum_{s=\pm 1}\sum_{\phi_\alpha}\int_{-\pi}^\pi\tfrac{\mathrm d k}{2\pi}\tfrac{\log\bigl|\sin \phi_\alpha^2 + \cos^2 \phi_\alpha \omega_s^2(k)\bigr|}{8(1-\alpha)}\, ,
%\end{equation}
Remarkably, also here the central charges of the CFTs describing the low-entangled excited states can be both half-integer and integer.

\end{figure}
%While this could look like the end of the sketch of a proof, it is regrettably not. 
Although persuasive, our analytical hints are based on the assumption that the local properties of any excited state can be described with a symbol that does not depend on the subsystem's length; but this is too restrictive.  %We are indeed not aware of any theorem that identifies the dimensionality of the quotient set of  locally different excited states with that of the symbols as described above; on the contrary, w
We can indeed easily imagine exotic sequences of excited states that do not fit in the classification above: e.g., for any given $|A|$, we can find excited states in which the density of excitations is $\sim \frac{\log|A|}{|A|}$, contaminating the family of states that break the area law logarithmically by states that satisfy the volume law. 
In order to rule out unconventional states satisfying the area law, we 
%We will therefore 
resort to a numerical analysis. 
%Thanks to the fermionic picture, given $L$, we can efficiently compute the energy and entropy of each eigenstate, as reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:scar_plot}.

We start considering finite chains and evaluate the half-chain von Neumann entropy of all excited states. 
Those satisfying the area law correspond to minima of such an entropy landscape that remain bounded even increasing the chain's length $L$.   For small $L$, we can recognise the global minima by a brute-force search. This is shown in  Fig.~\ref{fig:scar_plot} for CI, which suggests that the ground state and the maximal energy state have the lowest bipartite entanglement and points, in turn, at the absence of excited states satisfying the area law. A real quantitative difference between states satisfying or breaking the area law appears however only in much larger chains.  
The number of eigenstates, on the other hand, diverges exponentially with $L$, thus computing the entropy of all eigenstates becomes soon unfeasible. %, making this kind of analyses inconclusive.

    }
    \label{fig:percolation_plot}
\end{figure}
We circumvent this problem by means of simulated annealing:
We initialise the system in a random eigenstate $\ket{\{p\}}$ generated from a uniform distribution. At each step we make a particle-hole transformation at a random momentum and accept the new excited state $\ket{\{p'\}}$ with probability $\min\{\exp(\frac{S_1(\frac{L}{2};\{p\})-S_1(\frac{L}{2};\{p'\})}{\mathfrak s}, 1\}$ in analogy with the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.
Here $\mathfrak s$ is a parameter that depends on the iteration and is chosen so as to approach $0$ at the end of the simulation. %when the maximum number of iterations is reached. %The ultimate goal is to identify the global minimum even in the presence of a multitude of local minima.  
More details about the algorithm are reported in \textsc{sm}--\ref{SM:num}. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:percolation_plot} shows a run of it in CI. In a reasonable number of iterations the excited state becomes of the form that we investigated analytically (i.e., the number of discontinuities in its symbol becomes independent of $L$) and finally the algorithm selects the ground state or the maximal energy state.  Similar analyses for XX and X-X have confirmed the pictures drawn before %on the basis of the asymptotics of Toeplitz determinants 
and are reported in \textsc{sm}--\ref{SM:nummore}.

\paragraph*{A lower bound.} The last proof we give is based on a conjecture. In \textsc{sm}--\ref{SM:lower} we provide evidence that the half-chain von-Neumann entropy of an XX excited state for which $\hat \Sigma^{(1)}_{\{p\}}(k)$ has $n$ changes of signs satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conjecture}
S_1(A)\geq (\tfrac{\log 3}{2}-\tfrac{\log 2}{3}) n\, ,
\end{equation}
where $|A|=\frac{L}{2}$.
For CI, if we consider the discontinuities of the scalar symbol, an analogous expression applies with an overall factor $1/2$.  The area law can only hold if $n$ is finite. Since two locally different states differ in an extensive number of excitations, such a state would be always locally equivalent to one of the states that we addressed in the thermodynamic limit with a finite number of discontinuities smaller than or equal to~$n$. Thus, \eqref{eq:conjecture} implies our conclusions.  

\paragraph*{Equivalence of \shift{1} quasilocal models.}
Ref.~\cite{Bravyi2006Lieb} showed 
that %time evolution under local Hamiltonians does not spoil the locality properties of operators:
%that applying the transformation to a local operator does not spoil its locality properties: 
a local operator that time evolves for a finite time under a local Hamiltonian can still be approximated by another local operator with an error (in operator norm) that decreases exponentially with its range. %, which could be reformulated in the requirement  that the  generator of the transformation should have interactions that decay exponentially fast to zero with their range
Such transformations are used to define topological phases of matter~\cite{Zeng2019book} and will be denoted by $\mathfrak{L}$. They are relevant to us because they preserve the asymptotic dependency of the bipartite entropies on the subsystem's length. 
%We supplement them with other transformations that have a similar effect on local operators.
%In fact, they are not sufficient to our purposes. We include therefore also 
To that aim, however, one can also consider discrete transformations, denoted by $\mathfrak{D}$, that do not have a local generator %as the $\mathfrak{L}$ ones, 
but act as $\mathfrak{L}$ on local operators. An example is a shift by a finite number of sites. Since we are studying the entropies of connected blocks, we can overlook the difference between spins and fermions~\cite{Vidal2003Entanglement,Fagotti2010disjoint} and  preserve locality in whichever of the two spaces. This allows us to include also transformations such as a shift by one pseudo-site.  In \textsc{sm}--\ref{SM:equivalence} we show 
\begin{equation}
\hat {\mathcal H}^{(2)}(k)\overset{\mathfrak{L}}\mapsto\begin{cases}
e^{i n k \sigma^z}\sigma^y &\overset{\mathfrak{D}}{\mapsto}\ \sigma^y\\
\sin ke^{i n k \sigma^z}\sigma^x&\overset{\mathfrak{D}}{\mapsto}\ \sin k\sigma^x\\
\cos \tfrac{k}{2}  e^{i (n-\frac{1}{2}) k \sigma^z}\sigma^y&\overset{\mathfrak{D}}{\mapsto}\ \sin \tfrac{k}{2} e^{i \frac{k }{2} \sigma^z}\sigma^x \\
\sin \tfrac{k}{2} e^{i (n-\frac{1}{2}) k \sigma^z}\sigma^x &\overset{\mathfrak{D}}{\mapsto}\ \sin \tfrac{k}{2} e^{i \frac{k }{2} \sigma^z}\sigma^x 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where all symbols are defined up to multiplication by a smooth even function. 
In other words, we recognise four families of topologically different models. After additional discrete transformations,  the first family is mapped to XX, the second one to X-X, and the last two of them to CI.
Since only in XX there are excited states satisfying the area law but there are no quasilocal conserved operators whose ground state is described by a half-integer central charge, we can conclude that, quite generally, there are no excited states satisfying the area law when the ground state of a \shift{1} noninteracting Hamiltonian is described by a CFT with half-integer central charge.
\paragraph*{Discussion.} %One of our motivations for questioning the presence of excited states satisfying the area law or the conservation of gapped (quasi)local charges has been the exceptional observation of algebraic decay (with the distance) of connected correlations at late times after preparing a critical Ising chain in one-site shift invariant states satisfying the area law. 
%Algebraic decay could indeed be  expected when the initial state is critical or when it has sharp inhomogeneities --- see Refs~\cite{Maric2022Universality,Maric2023Universality}, but it is otherwise unusual: critical low-temperature properties of the Hamiltonian are generally irrelevant at late times, in that, if  gapped conserved charges exist, the Hamiltonian could be replaced by (almost) any of them without affecting the stationary behaviour of observables. %We have recognised an exception to this rule 
We have reported a no-go theorem connecting the  central charge of the conformal field theory describing the low-energy properties of a noninteracting spin chain with the existence of excited states satisfying the area law.  
%In these notes, the presence of a \oneshift excited state satisfying the area law is used interchangeably with the existence of a gapped quasilocal \oneshift conserved operator. In more general systems, the implication is only in one direction (the charge implies the state).
%We have shown that there are no gapped quasilocal conservation laws when the ground state of a \oneshift noninteracting Hamiltonian is described by a conformal field theory with half-integer central charge. The implication is however only in one direction, indeed we have also identified \oneshift models with an associated integer central charge without gapped \oneshift conserved charges. 
Concerning the generality of our findings, there are several open questions. Can the assumption of one-site shift invariance be partially relaxed? Does something similar apply also in the presence of interactions? 
%In so-called superintergrable (or, non-Abelian integrable) models such as the X-X one, the answer to our question is generally basis dependent. In the class of models that can be mapped to critical Ising, however, we have not been able to exploit the degeneracies to construct excited states satisfying the area law, and the question of whether this is possible relaxing the hypothesis of one-site shift invariance is still open. Finally, we have emphasised the apparent connection with the critical properties of the ground state (described by a CFT with half-integer central charge) because either our no-go theorem holds true in more general settings or its breakdown is a fingerprint of genuine interactions.  
In the thermodynamic limit any linear combination of excited states in a collapsing energy shell is conserved to all intents and purposes; does the result hold true also in such quasi-stationary states?

\subsection{On the zero energy modes}\label{SM:zero}
We remind the reader that the symbol of the correlation matrix of an excited state
commutes with the symbol of the Hamiltonian (otherwise the correlation matrix would have a nontrivial time evolution)~\cite{Alba2009Entanglement, Fagotti2016Charges}. 
In addition, for the state to be pure, its symbol should have eigenvalues $\pm 1$. 
These two conditions, together with the standard properties that a symbol is required to satisfy ($\hat T(k)=\hat T^\dag(k)=-\hat T^{t}(-k)$), completely characterise the symbols of the excited states. 

Remarkably, excited states with the same symmetries of the Hamiltonian do not necessarily exist. In particular, the smallest symbol representing an excited state could have a different size with respect to the smallest symbol representing the Hamiltonian.
This is what happens in the critical Ising model (CI). 
The scalar symbol of the CI's Hamiltonian, indeed, reads
$$
\hat{\mathcal H}^{(1)}(k)=\sin k\, .
$$
This clearly commutes with any other scalar function, but there is no scalar symbol that meets the conditions above in the Ramond sector: whatever function we choose, it will always have two eigenvalues equal to zero (associated with $k=0$ and $k=\pi$). Hence, the state is not pure. Pure excited states in the Ramond sector have a symbol that is at least 2-by-2. Specifically, it has the form
$$
\hat\Gamma^{(2)}(k)=\tfrac{\omega(\frac{k}{2})+\omega(\frac{k}{2}+\pi)}{2}\mathrm I_2+\tfrac{\omega(\frac{k}{2})-\omega(\frac{k}{2}+\pi)}{2}\sigma^x e^{-i\frac{k}{2}\sigma^z}+s \delta_{k 0}\sigma^y
$$
where $\omega(k),s\in \{-1,1\}$ and $\omega(-k)=-\omega(k)$. This symbol would have had also a scalar representation if $s$ could be set to zero. 
Instead, the excited states break the pseudo-shift invariance of the Ramond Hamiltonian  into \shift{1} invariance. 
In practice, the effect of $s$ in the correlation matrix is to introduce the following corrective term
$$
\frac{s}{L} \mathrm J_L\otimes \sigma^y
$$
where $\mathrm J_L$ is the $L$-by-$L$ matrix of ones. In the thermodynamic limit this term is irrelevant because it gives a correction $O(\frac{|A|}{L})$. The correction to the half-chain von-Neumann entropy is bounded as well by $\log 2$ because the mixed state ($s=0$) consists of the incoherent superposition of just two states ($s=\pm 1$). Nevertheless, in our numerical investigations we use the exact symbol. 

An analogous situation applies to the symbols of the excited states in the X-X model, where we have
\begin{multline}
\Gamma_{\{p\}}^{(2)}(k)=\tfrac{\hat \omega_{+,\{p\}}(k)+\hat \omega_{-,\{p\}}(k)}{2}\mathrm I+\tfrac{\hat \omega_{+,\{p\}}(k)-\hat \omega_{-,\{p\}}(k)}{2}\sigma^x+\\
(s_0 \delta_{k 0}+s_\pi \delta_{k \pi})\sigma^y\, ,
\end{multline}
with $\hat \omega_{s,\{p\}}(k)\in \{-1,1\}$  odd functions of $k$ and $s_0,s_\pi\in \{-1,1\}$ parametrize the ambiguity in the zero energy modes $k=0,\pi$. 

\subsection{On the numerical simulations}\label{SM:num}
%By working directly in the thermodynamic limit, we are leaving out from our discussion those eigenstates that are not well-defined in such a limit.
%In principle, one of those states may have an entropy that does not diverge with system's size even in the critical Ising model.
%Our claim is that, even if we consider those states, the eigenstate showing the smallest entropy is the ground state. This implies that the entropy of any eigenstate in the critical Ising grows at least logarithmically. To verify our claim in finite size, we performed a numerical analysis on chains of size $L$, assumed to be even for convenience.
%
%Before performing our numerical analysis, we start by recasting the spin Hamiltonian of a given length $L$ into a fermionic framework. This maps our original Hamiltonian into two sectors, each of which characterised by a quadratic fermionic Hamiltonian.
We have numerically searched for the state with minimal entorpy  in each fermionic sector (Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond) separately.
%We recall that, for each fermionic Hamiltonian there are $L$ momenta: $\{\frac{2\pi k}{L}\}_{k\in\{-L/2+1,..., L/2\}}$ for the Ramond sector (with periodic boundary conditions) and $\{\frac{\pi (2k-1)}{L}\}_{k\in\{-L/2+1,..., L/2\}}$ for the Neveu-Schwartz sector (with anti-periodic boundary conditions).
%An eigenstate is identified by which momenta are occupied: this gives the $2^L$ eigenstates of each fermionic Hamiltonian.
Those eigenstates are shared by the original spin Hamiltonian if they have the right parity of the number of excitations, i.e., $\prod_j \bs\sigma_j^z \ket{\{p\}}=-\ket{\{p\}}$ in Ramond and $\prod_j \bs\sigma_j^z \ket{\{p\}}=\ket{\{p\}}$ in Neveu-Schwarz. We have evaluated the expectation value of the flip operator using $\braket{\prod_{j=1}^L\sigma^z_j}=i^L\operatorname{Pf}(\Gamma)$, valid whenever the state is a Slater determinant.

Given the symbol associated with the excited state, we have reconstructed its correlation matrix via a (discrete) Fourier transform. From that we have then computed the half-chain von Neumann entropy using 
$$
S_1(A)=-\mathrm{tr}[\tfrac{\mathrm{I_{2|A|}+\Gamma_A}}{2}\log \tfrac{\mathrm{I_{2|A|}+\Gamma_A}}{2}].
$$
\paragraph*{Simulated annealing.}
Simulated annealing is an algorithm to approximate the global minimum of a function defined in a large search space. Since it does not rely on evaluating any gradient, it is particularly suited to our discrete search space, made by all the eigenstates.
To start off the algorithm 
%we restrict to one fermionic sector and 
we initialise the system in a random eigenstate, obtained by %deciding if its momenta are occupied or not by 
sampling the occupation of each momentum from a uniform distribution. At each step of the algorithm, the state is described by a set of occupied momenta $\{p\}$. The next step is obtained from the previous one %by updating the state 
as follows: a particle-hole transformation at a random momentum is performed, giving a new set of momenta $\{p'\}$; the new state is accepted with probability $\min\{\exp(\frac{S_1(\frac{L}{2};\{p\})-S_1(\frac{L}{2};\{p'\})}{\mathfrak s}, 1\}$ in analogy with the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.
%Here $s$ is a parameter that depends on the iteration and is chosen so as to approach $0$ at the end of the simulation.
%, at each step, we change the occupation number of a random momentum (from occupied to empty if the momentum was originally occupied and vice versa) and we accept the new configuration with probability $\min\{\exp((S_{old}-S_{new})/T_{eff}), 1\}$ in analogy with the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.
The reference entropy $\mathfrak s$ we use to rescale the entropies and define the acceptance probability is \emph{not} constant during the algorithm, but depends on the number of iteration: at the beginning we set it large enough not to significantly affect the probability to jump from one state to the other, and it goes to $0$ when approaching the maximum number of iterations. 
In this way, the algorithm initially explores the full landscape, ignoring small features of the entropy, then it drifts towards low-entropy regions and, once one of those regions has been chosen, it finally moves to its local minimum in a (quasi)deterministic way; the state that is finally reached is a candidate for being the global minimum. For the sake of generality, we have run the algorithm several times, also varying how $\mathfrak s$ is updated; in particular, we used power-law decays of the form 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spar}
    \mathfrak s= \mathfrak s_0\left(\frac{iteration_{tot} - iteration_{current}}{iteration_{tot}}\right)^\alpha,
\end{equation}
where $iteration_{tot}$ is the (chosen) total number of iterations, $iteration_{current}$ is the current iteration and $\alpha$ and $\mathfrak s_0$ are arbitrary positive real numbers.
%The minimum is searched independently in the two fermionic sectors, which gives only a lower bound for the entropy of the spin chain, but it is easy to check a posteriori if it is also an eigenstate of the spin chain.
%we are minimising on a larger landscape than the eigenstates of the spin chain. This is enough for us since it lower bounds the minimum of the entropy of the spin chain.
%
%When simulated annealing is applied to CI, the minimum value of the entropy that is ever reached is the one of the ground state (which equals the entropy of the maximally-excited state).
%For a given run, it is interesting to look at the occupation numbers of excitations on top of the ground state: they stay completely disordered at first and then they start to clusterise, until every domain disappears, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:percolation_plot}. This means that the algorithm has selected the ground state or the maximally-excited state.



\subsection{Additional numerical evidence}\label{SM:nummore}

In this section we provide additional numerical data in support of the picture drawn in the main text. 
%to better illustrate how simulated annealing works. Moreover, we show some results of the algorithm when it is applied not only to CI, but also to the other classes of models.

We recall that our goal is to find the minima of the entropy in the XX, critical Ising, and strongly anisotropic XY model. The full entropy landscapes in a small chain are reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:entropy_combo_all}. In the figure we consider a special combination of entropies $c_{eff}\equiv(S_{1}(L/2)-S_{1}(L/4))\frac{6}{\log 2}$ that asymptotically gives $0$ for states satisfying the area law and the central charge for low-entangled states with an underlying conformal field theory.
%More precisely, such a combination gives the effective central charge, based on the observation that states that can be mapped to conformal field theories have an entropy that scales as $\frac{c}{3}\log\frac{L}{\pi}$, where $c$ is the central charge. 
Analogous combinations of entropies  with a similar goal have been used e.g. in \cite{Lauchli_2008}.

    \label{fig:entropy_combo_all}
\end{figure}




Fig.~\ref{fig:annealing_history_all} shows the variation of the entropy during several runs of simulated annealing. As the number of iterations increases, the entropy approaches a minimum. The algorithm does not always converge to what we have identified as the absolute minimum: when it does not, we have checked that it gets stuck in a configuration with few domain walls, whose entropy is well described in the thermodynamic limit and grows logarithmically with the system's size.

\end{figure}


Fig.~\ref{fig:percolation_all} reports 
the occupation number of all momenta during single runs of simulated annealing.
For the sake of simplicity, we have chosen  the ground state as the vacuum of the excitations. In all the three models the ground state is critical and its entropy grows logarithmically with the system's size.
We see that the occupation numbers are completely uncorrelated as long as $\mathfrak s$ --- \eqref{eq:spar} --- is large enough, then they start forming clusters as $\mathfrak s$ decreases.
In the specific run, the finial state in CI %is described by $\Gamma_{\{0\}}$ and
belongs to the ground-state's eigenspace.
The final state in XX is the one with all spins aligned along the $z$ direction: the Fermi sea appearing in the panel exactly compensates the Fermi sea of the ground state. 
The final state in X-X is the maximally excited state.

\subsection{A lower bound for the von Neumann entropy}\label{SM:lower}

Ref.~\cite{Alba2009Entanglement} identified a class of excited states with exceptional entanglement properties. Their symbol has a repeated pattern of sign changes and the corresponding entropies exhibit a finite-size profile with a remarkable piece-wise linear behaviour. Here we provide evidence that the states with minimal entropy for given number of changes of sign 
belong to this class. This, in turn, will allow us to conjecture the value of the minimal entropy. 
We start with the XX model and define the excitations with respect to one of the two ferromagnetic excited states. We represent the excited states as domains of occupied neighbourhood momenta alternating with domains of unoccupied ones. 
Our reasoning starts from the following observations:
\begin{itemize}
\item At fixed number of domains, if they have an extensive size, the mapping to a conformal field theory indicates that the half-chain entropy scales as $\frac{c}{3}\log\frac{L}{\pi}$, where the central charge $c$ can be identified with half the number of domains $n$. 
\item The excited states corresponding to scattering the occupied momenta uniformly consist of an effective pattern that repeats over and over again.  There, in the thermodynamic limit ($|A|\ll L$) the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem $A$ scales as $H(\frac{n}{2L})|A|$, where $H(x)=-x\log x-(1-x)\log(1-x)$ is the binary entropy function.
For $n\ll L$ this behaves as $\frac{n|A|}{2L}\log(\frac{2L}{n})$. %Since the von Neumann entropy is concave, an upper bound for the half-chain entropy is then $\frac{n}{4}\log(\frac{2L}{n})$, which becomes smaller than the naive estimation of the entropy for the CFT configurations for $n>2(\frac{L}{\pi^2})^{\frac{1}{3}}$.
\item If there are domains with different patterns, in the thermodynamic limit the entropy develops a positive logarithmic correction. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the entropy is minimal for the smallest possible number of domains.
\end{itemize}
In view of this, we study the configurations corresponding to a single domain of a repeated pattern in which only one momentum is occupied out of $b$; outside the domain the momenta will be all unoccupied. 
We claim that the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of length $\ell$ has the following leading asymptotic behaviour:
%\begin{multline}
%S_1(\ell)\sim \\
%\tfrac{n}{2}H(\tfrac{j-1}{b})+\tfrac{n b [H(\frac{j}{b})-H(\frac{j-1}{b})]}{2L}(\ell-\tfrac{(j-1)L}{b})\quad \tfrac{(j-1)L}{b}<\ell<\tfrac{ j L}{b}
%\end{multline}
\begin{equation}
S_1(\ell)\sim 
\tfrac{n}{2}\Bigl[H(\tfrac{2}{b}\lfloor\tfrac{b \ell}{L}\rfloor)+[H(\tfrac{1}{b}\lceil\tfrac{b \ell}{L}\rceil)-H(\tfrac{1}{b}\lfloor\tfrac{b \ell}{L}\rfloor)](\tfrac{b\ell}{L}-\lfloor\tfrac{b \ell}{L}\rfloor)\Bigr]\, .
\end{equation} 
Thus we get

%Ignoring the logarithmic corrections, which we are going to discuss in a moment, t
The configuration associated with the minimal half-chain entropy has $b=3$.  
Note, however, that the states we consider exist only if $ n \leq \frac{2L}{b}$ and, for $ n < \frac{2L}{b}$ there is a logarithmic correction $O(\log L)$ due to the partially filled Fermi sea. 
In the specific case minimising the entropy, the expression is valid up to $n\leq \frac{2}{3}L$. For  $n>\frac{2}{3}L$ the states with minimal entropy display more patterns, exhibiting in turn a larger entropy than the naive extension of our estimation $\frac{n}{2}H(1/3)$ outside its range of validity. We therefore conclude
\begin{equation}
S_1(\tfrac{L}{2})\geq \tfrac{n}{2}H(\tfrac{1}{3})\, .
\end{equation}
Fig.~\ref{fig:minimum_config_xx} shows the validity of our conjecture in small chains up to $26$ spins. Note that, for $n=\frac{2L}{3}$ there are no logarithmic corrections and the inequality seems to be exactly saturated.

An analogous (though a little more involved) analysis applies to the critical Ising model if we represent the excited states as domains of pseudo-momenta in which the (antisymmetric!) scalar symbol is $1$ alternating with domains in which it is $-1$. We then find the bound
\begin{equation}
S_1(\tfrac{L}{2})\geq \tfrac{n}{4}H(\tfrac{1}{3})\, .
\end{equation}
The validity of this conjecture is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:minimum_config_ising}.

\subsection{On the equivalence of models}\label{SM:equivalence}
We use here the label `one-site shift invariant model' to indicate the algebra of the one-site shift invariant local conservation laws. We then say that two models are equivalent if they can be mapped to one another by a unitary transformation that preserves the locality properties of either the spins or the underlying fermions. As far as the entanglement of a connected block of spins is concerned, the fermionic bipartite entanglement is equivalent to the spin one~\cite{Vidal2003Entanglement,Fagotti2010disjoint}, hence we can allow transformations preserving the locality of either fermions or spins. 
We identify such pseudolocal classes of equivalence within noninteracting spin chains and exhibit what is arguably the simplest representative of each class. 
We consider one-site shift invariant noninteracting Hamiltonians with short-range or exponentially fast decaying interactions.
Their most general 2-by-2 symbol reads
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathcal H}^{(2)}(k)=w(k)\mathrm I+\vec \varepsilon(k)\cdot \vec \sigma
\end{equation}
where $w(-k)=-w(k)$ and $\varepsilon_j(-k)=-(-1)^j \varepsilon_j(k)$ are smooth functions of $k$. 
%Strong quasilocality, i.e., the exponential decay of interactions with their range, translates in $w(k)$ and $\vec \varepsilon(k)$ being smooth functions of $k$. 
Since any operator with symbol proportional to the identity (such as the quadratic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction) commutes with the Hamiltonian, without loss of generality we can set $w(k)=0$ (it does not affect the set of one-site shift invariant charges). For the sake of simplicity we also assume $\varepsilon_3(k)=0$; the generality of this assumption will be addressed later. We start considering a one-site shift invariant transformation generated by an operator with exponentially decaying interaction. By applying such a quasilocal transformation to the XX model, we end up with a model characterised by a symbol of the form
\begin{multline}\label{eq:mapping1}
\varepsilon(k)e^{i\frac{\theta(k)}{2}\sigma^z}\sigma^y e^{-i\frac{\theta(k)}{2}\sigma^z}=\\
\varepsilon(k)\cos\theta(k)\sigma^y+\varepsilon(k)\sin\theta(k)\sigma^x.
\end{multline}
If this symbol is smooth, it parametrises a generic model of the kind discussed above. For it to be smooth
it would be sufficient that $\varepsilon^2(k)$ is smooth and $\theta(k)$ is smooth up to odd jumps multiple of $\pi$, which could be compensated by changes of sign in $\varepsilon(k)$. Our locality assumptions on the transformation, on the other hand, require $\theta(k)$ to be an odd smooth function in $(-\pi,\pi)$ extended by periodicity. 
As a matter of fact, we can always redefine $\theta(k)$ so as to remove the jumps in $]-\pi,0[\cup ]0,\pi[$ at the price of potential jumps at $k=0$ and $k=\pm\pi$. We can also shrink the discontinuity at $k=0$ as much as possible, which means that it will become either $0$ (hence, $\theta(k)$ continuous in its neighbourhoods) or $\pi$. The discontinuity at $k=\pi$ will then be any multiple of $\pi$. After these redefinitions, the equivalence between the generic model represented by the right hand side of \eqref{eq:mapping1} and the XX model  is established only when $\theta(k)$ is smooth at $k=0$ and $k=\pi$. But this is not the end of the story. 
Let us  consider indeed the case in which $\theta(k)$ is continuous at $k=0$ but has a $2n\pi$ discontinuity at $k=\pm \pi$. 
We can write
$$
\theta(k)=\theta_0(k)+n k\quad k\in(-\pi,\pi)\, ,
$$
where $\theta_0(k)$ is smooth. Since the discontinuity at $k=\pm \pi$ does not change the sign of $\sin\theta(k)$ and $\cos\theta(k)$, $\varepsilon(k)$ can be any smooth even function of $k$. This means that a transformation preserving the spin locality maps the model into one characterised by the symbol
$$
\epsilon(k)\sigma^y e^{-i n k \sigma^z}\, ,%=\cos(nk)\sigma^y+\sin(nk)\sigma^x\, .
$$
with $\epsilon(-k)=\epsilon(k)$ a smooth function of $k$.
Let us now consider local unitary transformations that are not generated by operators with exponentially decaying interactions. A relevant example 
is the Kramers-Wannier duality corresponding to shifting the Majorana fermions $\bs a_j$ by one pseudo-site. It is easy to show that it is translated into the following mapping
$$
\epsilon(k)\sigma^y e^{-in k \sigma^z}\mapsto -\epsilon(k) \sigma^y e^{i(n-1) k \sigma^z}\, .
$$
This allows us to restrict to even $n=2m$, i.e., symbols of the form
$
\epsilon(k) \sigma^y e^{-2i m k \sigma^z}
$.
Remarkably, we can also get rid of $e^{-2i m k \sigma^z}$ by shifting the Majorana fermions by $m$ pseudosites in opposite directions depending on the parity of their pseudosite. 
And the model is finally mapped into  XX
$$
\epsilon(k)\sigma^y e^{-i n k \sigma^z}\mapsto \epsilon(k)\sigma^y\, .
$$

Let us now consider the case in which  $\theta(k)$ has a $\pi$ discontinuity at $k=0$ and a $(2n+1)\pi$  discontinuity at $k=\pi$.  We can write
$$
\theta(k)=\theta_0(k)+\tfrac{\pi}{2}\mathrm{sgn}(\sin(k))+n k\, ,
$$
and the model can be mapped into
$$
\epsilon(k)\sin k\sigma^xe^{-i n k \sigma^z}
$$
A Kramers-Wannier duality is translated into the mapping
$$
\epsilon(k)\sin k\sigma^xe^{-i n k \sigma^z}\mapsto \epsilon(k)\sin k\sigma^xe^{i (n-1) k \sigma^z}
$$
which allows us again to focus on even $n=2m$ and apply the same asymmetric shift as before to the Majorana fermions. This results in the symbol
$$
\epsilon(k)\sin k\sigma^x\, .
$$
Interestingly, for $\epsilon(k)=1$ the associated Hamiltonian can be mapped to the XX one by the spin flip $\prod_j \bs\sigma_{2j-1}^y\bs\sigma_{2j}^z$, which however breaks one-site shift invariance. One could then map the one-site shift invariant excited states of this models to a basis of excited states of the XX model that generally breaks one-site shift invariance. 


Let us now consider $\theta(k)$ continuous around $k=0$ and discontinuous with a $(2n-1)\pi$ discontinuity at $\pi$.  We can write
$$
\theta(k)=\theta_0(k)+(n-\tfrac{1}{2})k\, .
$$
While $\sin\theta(k)$ and $\cos\theta(k)$ do not change sign at $k=0$, they do it at $k=\pi$, which should be compensated by a change of sign of $\varepsilon(k)$. Since $\varepsilon(k)$ can not be discontinuous at $k=\pi$, it has to vanish. A transformation generated by a quasilocal operator maps therefore the model into
$$
\epsilon(k)\cos \tfrac{k}{2} \sigma^y e^{-i (n-\frac{1}{2}) k \sigma^z}\, .
$$
A Kramers-Wannier duality is translated into the mapping
$$
\epsilon(k)\cos \tfrac{k}{2} \sigma^y e^{-i (n-\frac{1}{2}) k \sigma^z}\mapsto -\epsilon(k)\cos \tfrac{k}{2} \sigma^y e^{i (n-\frac{3}{2}) k \sigma^z}\, ,
$$
which allows us again to restrict ourselves to even $n=2m$ and apply the same asymmetric shift as before to the Majorana fermions. This results in the symbol
$$
\cos \tfrac{k}{2} \sigma^y e^{-i \frac{k}{2} \sigma^z}\, ,
$$
which represents the critical Ising model with negative magnetic field. Note that the sign of the field can be changed by a spin flip in the $x$ direction, which is not captured by the transformations considered so far because its symbol does not have a 2-by-2 representation.  

The last case to consider is when 
there is a $\pi$ discontinuity at $k=0$ and a $2n \pi$ discontinuity at $k=\pi$, that is to say,
$$
\theta(k)=\theta_0(k)+\tfrac{\pi}{2}\mathrm{sgn}(\sin(\tfrac{k}{2}))+(n-\tfrac{1}{2})k\, ,
$$
with $\theta_0(k)$ smooth. While $\sin\theta(k)$ and $\cos\theta(k)$ do not change sign at $k=\pi$, they do it at $k=0$, which should be compensated by $\varepsilon(k)$. Since $\varepsilon(k)$ can not be discontinuous at $k=0$, it has to vanish. The model can then be mapped into
$$
\epsilon(k)\sin \tfrac{k}{2} \sigma^x e^{-i (n-\frac{1}{2}) k \sigma^z}
$$
Again, a Kramers-Wannier duality is translated into the mapping
$$
\epsilon(k)\sin k\sigma^xe^{-i (n-\frac{1}{2}) k \sigma^z}\mapsto \epsilon(k)\sin k\sigma^xe^{i (n-\frac{3}{2}) k \sigma^z}\, ,
$$
which allows us to assume $n$ even and apply the asymmetric shift as before to the Majorana fermions, finally bringing the symbol to
$$
\epsilon(k)\sin k\sigma^xe^{-i \frac{k}{2} \sigma^z}\, ,
$$
which corresponds to the critical Ising model (with positive magnetic field). 

We now address the problem of generality of the symbol we started from, i.e., the fact that we assumed $\varepsilon_3(k)=0$. In particular, we wonder whether a more generic symbol can always be mapped into the one we considered. We parametrise the most generic symbol as follows
\begin{multline}
e^{i\frac{\phi(k)}{2}\sigma^y}\mathcal H^{(2)}(k) e^{-i\frac{\phi(k)}{2}\sigma^y}=\\
\cos \phi(k)\mathcal H^{(2)}(k)+\sin \phi(k) \varepsilon(k)\sin \theta(k)\sigma^z\, ,
\end{multline}
where $\mathcal H^{(2)}(k)$ belongs to the family of symbols considered above. Analogously to the previous case, the smoothness of the right hand side of the equation translates into $\phi(k)$ being smooth up to $\pi$ discontinuities, which can again be fixed by a proper choice of the sign of $\varepsilon(k)$. Since $\phi(k)$ is even by the symmetry constraints on the symbol, all the discontinuities are removable and hence the operator with symbol $\frac{\phi(k)}{2}\sigma^y$, which generates the desired transformation, can always be chosen quasilocal. This shows that, without loss of generality, we can impose $\varepsilon_3(k)=0$.

   abstract = {Abstract Most work in dynamic heat exchanger modeling for control design can be classified as either a finite volume or a moving boundary formulation. These approaches represent fundamentally different discretization approaches and are often characterized as contrasting accuracy with simulation speed. This work challenges that characterization by validating finite volume and moving boundary heat exchanger models with experimental data from a vapor compression system in order to demonstrate that these approaches are capable of achieving similar levels of accuracy. However, there are differences. The moving boundary model is found to have faster simulation speed, while the finite volume model is more flexible for adaptation to heat exchangers of different physical configuration. The formulation of each modeling approach used in this work is described in detail and techniques to increase simulation speed and avoid numerical issues in implementation are discussed.},

   abstract = {In order to overcome the increasing demand–supply energy gap due to the rapid urbanization, labor productivity, consumerism and depletion of fossil fuel resources, there is a need for the development of technologies with renewable energy sources. Phase change materials are one of the most appropriate materials for effective utilization of thermal energy from the renewable energy resources. As evident from the literature, development of phase change materials is one of the most active research fields for thermal energy storage with higher efficiency. This review focuses on the application of various phase change materials based on their thermophysical properties. In particular, the melting point, thermal energy storage density and thermal conductivity of the organic, inorganic and eutectic phase change materials are the major selection criteria for various thermal energy storage applications with a wider operating temperature range. The strategy adopted in improving the thermal energy storage characteristics of the phase change materials through encapsulation as well as nanomaterials additives, are discussed in detail. Specifically, the future research trends in the encapsulation and nanomaterials are also highlighted.},

   abstract = {The operation of combined heat and power systems is inherently challenging due to the fact that they synchronously generate power and heat while being tasked to meet asynchronous loads. By integrating thermal storage into the system, these loads can be temporally decoupled, albeit at the cost of a more complex dynamical system. In this paper we present a nonlinear, reduced order dynamic model of a small-scale, proton exchange membrane fuel cell combined heat and power system with sensible thermal energy storage in the form of a stratified hot water tank. By modeling the thermal stratification dynamics within the thermal storage, its storage capacity, and the temperature of water that will be discharged from the tank, can be accurately quantified. A quasi-static approach is used to couple the dynamic components without increasing the model order, thereby minimizing computational burden. The resulting system model is fully parameterized by the system temperatures and model inputs, making it well suited for use as a faster than real-time, simulated testbed. The model's empirical parameters are identified from experimental data, and the resulting system model is validated against an experimental testbed over a wide operating range. The results of the experimental validation show that the model is able to predict the electrical power and temperature of hot water provided to the end user within a normalized root mean square error of 1.58 and 8.34, respectively. The presented model is available for download from a public repository through the URL provided at the end of the manuscript.},

   abstract = {Hybrid-electric aircraft represent an important step in the transition from conventional fuel-based propulsion to fully-electric aircraft. For hybrid power systems, overall aircraft performance and efficiency highly depend on the coordination of the fuel and electrical systems and the ability to effectively control state and input trajectories at the limits of safe operation. In such a safety-critical application, the chosen control strategy must ensure the closed-loop system adheres to these operational limits. While hierarchical Model Predictive Control (MPC) has proven to be a computationally efficient approach to coordinated control of complex systems across multiple timescales, most formulations are not supported by theoretical guarantees of actu-ator and state constraint satisfaction. To provide guaranteed constraint satisfaction, this paper presents set-based hierarchical MPC of a 16 state hybrid-electric aircraft power system. Within the proposed two-level vertical hierarchy, the long-term control decisions of the upper-level controller and the short-term control decisions of the lower-level controller are coordinated through the use of waysets. Simulation results show the benefits of this coordination in the context of hybrid-electric aircraft performance and demonstrate the practicality of applying set-based hierarchical MPC to complex multi-timescale systems.},

   abstract = {Ice in a rectangular enclosure is melted by heating from the top, while maintained at its melting point at the bottom. The other surfaces are insulated. In the enclosure near the hot region, liquid phase starts forming as temperatures reach values higher than the melting point of ice. This phenomenon is first modeled by ignoring the effect of natural convection in the liquid phase. The resulting equations of conservation of energy are solved in each phase. The motion of melting front is governed by an energy balance at the interface. This conduction model is verified by applying it on a system for which an analytical solution is available. The model is then extended to include convective heat transfer in such a way that the liquid phase is assumed to be a mixed body subjected to natural convection from the top surface and the liquid-solid interface. The flux at the interface is obtained by finding a heat transfer coefficient for natural convection with a cold plate facing upward. Comparison of the results of the numerical work with experiments performed on water/ice system shows a strong effect of natural convection on melting of ice. The model involving natural convection in the liquid phase agrees well with the experimental work. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   abstract = {Advances in power density, energy storage technology, and thermal management are crucial to the increased electrification of vehicles, including those with high ramp rate loads such as heavy construction and military vehicles. In this thesis, a hybrid electro-thermal energy storage system is introduced which offers a power-dense electro-thermal energy storage solution for future electrified vehicles. This energy storage system includes energy-dense batteries and power-dense ultracapacitors for electrical energy storage, and phase change material thermal energy storage modules and coolant loops for thermal energy storage. Multi-domain graph-based modeling techniques are used to facilitate modeling, control, and design optimization of the energy storage system. Graph-based models capture multi-domain dynamics in a unified framework. A heuristic control strategy is used, which seeks to protect the energy storage elements while maintaining reference signals. Sizing and control parameters of the electro-thermal energy storage system are optimized using a graph-based optimization framework. Optimized designs demonstrate significant reductions in size while retaining a high level of performance, leading to improvements in power density. A multi-domain optimization formulation is compared to optimization subroutines which individually optimize parameters pertaining to the electrical and thermal domains. Additionally, the multi-domain sizing and control optimization study is compared to a similar study in which the control parameters are not optimized. The results accentuate the importance of considering multi-domain dynamics as well as control in the design process for dynamic systems. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS},

This study aims to validate the feasibility of a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for commercial building in response to occupancy variations and time-variant electricity prices in comparison to a conventional rule-based control (RBC) strategy. The building energy system included an air-cooled chiller, stratified chilled water thermal energy storage, two fan coil units, three heat exchangers, and five pumps. The optimal operations of the chiller and storage system were determined with the goal of minimizing the operating cost while maintaining the zone temperature at a cooling set point temperature during cooling operation hours. Artificial neural network was utilized as prediction models and metaheuristics algorithm was employed as optimization solver to construct a reliable and computationally manageable MPC controller. The simulation was performed for four days during the cooling season with a confirmed optimal prediction time horizon of 24 h and a control timestep of 1 h intervals. In conclusion, MPC reduced the total operating cost by 3.4 compared to the RBC, which prioritized the storage system operation to manage the thermal load.},

The experiments provide conclusive evidence of the important role played by natural convection in melting a solid due to an embedded cylindrical heat source. The four distinct pieces of quantitative evidence which contribute to this conclusion are the melt shape, surface temperature, local and average heat transfer coefficients and their variation with time. The experimental findings prove the importance of natural convection in phase change problems involving melting and indicate that continued practice of neglecting the effects in the analysis of such problems does not appear reasonable.

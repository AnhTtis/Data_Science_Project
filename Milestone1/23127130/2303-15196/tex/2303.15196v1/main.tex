% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
A novel comparison is presented of the effect of optimiser choice on the accuracy of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To give insight into why some optimisers are better, a new approach is proposed that tracks the training trajectory curvature and can be evaluated on the fly at a low computational cost. The linear advection equation is studied for several advective velocities, and we show that the optimiser choice substantially impacts PINNs model performance and accuracy.  Furthermore, using the curvature measure, we found a negative correlation between the convergence error and the curvature in the optimiser local reference frame. It is concluded that, in this case, larger local curvature values result in better solutions. Consequently, optimisation of PINNs is made more difficult as minima are in highly curved regions.

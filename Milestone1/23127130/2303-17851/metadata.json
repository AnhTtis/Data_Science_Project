    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider Fredlin-Wentzell type large deviation principle (LDP) of multidimensional reflected stochastic partial differential equations in a convex domain, allowing for oblique direction of reflection. To prove the LDP, a sufficient condition for the weak convergence method and penalized method plays an important role.",

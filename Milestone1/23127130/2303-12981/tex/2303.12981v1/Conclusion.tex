\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

We study the superlevel set of the policy optimization problem under the MDP framework and show that it is always a connected set under a tabular policy and for policies parameterized by a class of neural networks. We apply this result to derive a previously unknown minimax theorem for a robust RL problem. An immediate future direction of the work is to investigate whether/how the result discussed in this paper can be used to design better RL algorithms.
In \citet{fatkhullin2021optimizing}, the authors show that the original LQR problem has connected level sets, but the partially observable LQR does not. It is interesting to study whether this observation extends to the MDP setting, i.e. the policy optimization problem under a partially observable MDP can be shown to have disconnected superlevel sets.

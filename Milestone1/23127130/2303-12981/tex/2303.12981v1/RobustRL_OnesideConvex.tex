\section{Convexity of Optimization Program \eqref{eq:robustrl_convexside}}\label{sec:robustrl_convexside_proof}

In this section, we show that \eqref{eq:robustrl_convexside} is a convex optimization program. First, we note that
\begin{align*}
    J_{r'}(\pi)=\sum_{s,a}r'(s,a)\widehat{\mu}_{\pi}=\widehat{\mu}_{\pi}^{\top}r',
\end{align*}
which means that the objective function is linear in the reward.

The constraint set is obvious closed. It is also bounded as the reward $r(s,a)\in[0,U_r]$. To prove the constraint set is convex, we need to show that for any $r_1,r_2$ such that $\operatorname{Attack}(r_1,\pi_{\dagger},\epsilon_{\dagger})=r_{\dagger}$ and $\operatorname{Attack}(r_2,\pi_{\dagger},\epsilon_{\dagger})=r_{\dagger}$, we have
\begin{align}
    \operatorname{Attack}(\alpha r_1+(1-\alpha)r_2,\pi_{\dagger},\epsilon_{\dagger})=r_{\dagger},\quad\forall \alpha\in[0,1].\label{eq:robustrl_convexside:proof_eq1}
\end{align}

By the optimality condition of \eqref{eq:attack_obj}, $r_{\dagger}$ being the optimal poisoned reward for true reward $r_1$ and $r_2$ is equivalent to
\begin{align*}
    \langle r-r_{\dagger},r_1-r_{\dagger}\rangle\leq 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \langle r-r_{\dagger},r_2-r_{\dagger}\rangle\leq 0
\end{align*}
for all $r$ such that $J_r(\pi_{\dagger})\geq J_r(\pi)+\epsilon_{\dagger},\,\forall \pi\in\Pi^{\text{det}}\backslash\pi_{\dagger}$. By taking the convex combination of these two inequalities, we have for any $\alpha\in[0,1]$
\begin{align}
    \langle r-r_{\dagger},\alpha r_1+(1-\alpha)r_2-r_{\dagger}\rangle\leq 0\label{eq:robustrl_convexside:proof_eq2}
\end{align}
for all $r$ such that $J_r(\pi_{\dagger})\geq J_r(\pi)+\epsilon_{\dagger},\,\forall \pi\in\Pi^{\text{det}}\backslash\pi_{\dagger}$. Again by the optimality condition of \eqref{eq:attack_obj}, \eqref{eq:robustrl_convexside:proof_eq2} is equivalent to \eqref{eq:robustrl_convexside:proof_eq1}.

At this point, we have shown that \eqref{eq:robustrl_convexside} has a linear objective function and a convex (and also compact) constraint set. As a result, the optimization program is convex.

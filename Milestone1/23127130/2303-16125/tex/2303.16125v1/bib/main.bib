abstract = {At many levels, from storage infrastructures to programming paradigms, billion-node graphs pose considerable obstacles. It is necessary to provide a general-purpose graph-processing platform. A distributed memory system is thought to be a viable platform for both on-line and offline query processing and graph analytics. In this research, we look at how to partition a billion-node graph on such a platform, which is crucial because it affects load balancing and communication overhead directly. It's difficult not only because the graph is vast, but also because we can't assume that the data can be structured in any way to maximize the partitioning algorithm's speed. Instead, the algorithm must follow the system's and other applications' data and programming models. We present a multi-level label propagation (MLP) method for graph partitioning in this paper.}

Algorithms â€œlocal extreme exchangeâ€ (LEE) and â€œoverall extreme exchangeâ€ (OEE) are presented by modifying Kernighan-Lin's two way uniform partitioning method. In algorithm LEE, a node which maximizes the reduced cost is selected and exchanged with a node in another cluster such that the gain from the exchange with the selected node is maximized. The computational time efficiency of LEE is verified to be excellent compared to Kernighan-Lin's method. Algorithm OEE which considers a node pair that maximizes the reduced exchange cost is illustrated to be superior to the Kernighan-Lin's method. The time requirement of the proposed algorithm is also shown to be smaller than that of Kernighan-Lin's procedure.}

abstract = {Current quantum computer designs will not scale. To scale beyond small prototypes, quantum architectures will likely adopt a modular approach with clusters of tightly connected quantum bits and sparser connections between clusters. We exploit this clustering and the statically-known control flow of quantum programs to create tractable partitioning heuristics which map quantum circuits to modular physical machines one time slice at a time. Specifically, we create optimized mappings for each time slice, accounting for the cost to move data from the previous time slice and using a tunable lookahead scheme to reduce the cost to move to future time slices. We compare our approach to a traditional statically-mapped, owner-computes model. Our results show strict improvement over the static mapping baseline. We reduce the non-local communication overhead by 89.8\% in the best case and by 60.9\% on average. Our techniques, unlike many exact solver methods, are computationally tractable.},

abstract = {In May of 2016, IBM Research has made a quantum processor available in the cloud to the general public. The possibility of programming an actual quantum device has elicited much enthusiasm. Yet, quantum programming still lacks the compiler support that modern programming languages enjoy today. To use universal quantum computers like IBM's, programmers must design low-level circuits. In particular, they must map logical qubits into physical qubits that need to obey connectivity constraints. This task resembles the early days of programming, in which software was built in machine languages. In this paper, we formally introduce the qubit allocation problem and provide an exact solution to it. This optimal algorithm deals with the simple quantum machinery available today; however, it cannot scale up to the more complex architectures scheduled to appear. Thus, we also provide a heuristic solution to qubit allocation, which is faster than the current solutions already implemented to deal with this problem.},

abstract = {A massive gap exists between current quantum computing (QC) prototypes, and the size and scale required for many proposed QC algorithms. Current QC implementations are prone to noise and variability which affect their reliability, and yet with less than 80 quantum bits (qubits) total, they are too resource-constrained to implement error correction. The term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) refers to these current and near-term systems of 1000 qubits or less. Given NISQ's severe resource constraints, low reliability, and high variability in physical characteristics such as coherence time or error rates, it is of pressing importance to map computations onto them in ways that use resources efficiently and maximize the likelihood of successful runs. This paper proposes and evaluates backend compiler approaches to map and optimize high-level QC programs to execute with high reliability on NISQ systems with diverse hardware characteristics. Our techniques all start from an LLVM intermediate representation of the quantum program (such as would be generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC executables runnable on the IBM Q public QC machine. We then use this framework to implement and evaluate several optimal and heuristic mapping methods. These methods vary in how they account for the availability of dynamic machine calibration data, the relative importance of various noise parameters, the different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using real-system measurements, we show that fine grained spatial and temporal variations in hardware parameters can be exploited to obtain an average 2.9x (and up to 18x) improvement in program success rate over the industry standard IBM Qiskit compiler. Despite small qubit counts, NISQ systems will soon be large enough to demonstrate "quantum supremacy", i.e., an advantage over classical computing. Tools like ours provide significant improvements in program reliability and execution time, and offer high leverage in accelerating progress towards quantum supremacy.},

abstract="While an exact algorithm for placement and routing generates solutions of optimum quality in terms of the circuit layout area, its scalability is inherently limited by the problem's intractability. In this chapter, limiting factors of the problem domain and existing algorithms are identified, which are providing the base for an approximation via utilization of graph-theoretical findings. By restricting certain degrees of freedom like the underlying clocking scheme and logic network structure, a scalable algorithm for placement and routing emerges that offers polynomial complexity in both time and space without the loss of Boolean expressive power. It allows for the automatic design of circuit layouts for logic networks with tens of thousands of nodes within seconds. Thus, compared to former state-of-the-art algorithms in the domain, a scalability improvement of several orders of magnitude is achieved.",

	abstract = {To run quantum algorithms on emerging gate-model quantum hardware, quantum circuits must be compiled to take into account constraints on the hardware. For near-term hardware, with only limited means to mitigate decoherence, it is critical to minimize the duration of the circuit. We investigate the application of temporal planners to the problem of compiling quantum circuits to newly emerging quantum hardware. While our approach is general, we focus on compiling to superconducting hardware architectures with nearest neighbor constraints. Our initial experiments focus on compiling Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) circuits whose high number of commuting gates allow great flexibility in the order in which the gates can be applied. That freedom makes it more challenging to find optimal compilations but also means there is a greater potential win from more optimized compilation than for less flexible circuits. We map this quantum circuit compilation problem to a temporal planning problem, and generated a test suite of compilation problems for QAOA circuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware architecture. We report compilation results from several state-of-the-art temporal planners on this test set. This early empirical evaluation demonstrates that temporal planning is a viable approach to quantum circuit compilation.}

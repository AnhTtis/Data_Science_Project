TITLE={Mapping Constrained Optimization Problems to Quantum Annealing with Application to Fault Diagnosis},      
	
JOURNAL={Frontiers in ICT},      
	
VOLUME={3},      

PAGES={14},

ABSTRACT={Current quantum annealing (QA) hardware suffers from practical limitations such as finite temperature, sparse connectivity, small qubit numbers, and control error. We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In particular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a hardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two new decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly into hardware.

The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising models are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in different constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In contrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising model for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to generate a hardware compatible Ising model.  We give an example of a class of CSPs for which the scaling performance of the D-Wave hardware using the local mapping technique is significantly better than global embedding. 

We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's QA hardware to circuit-based fault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is typically able to find \emph{all} solutions from a min-fault diagnosis set of size N using 1000N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a leading SAT-based sampling method. Further, we apply decomposition algorithms to find min-cardinality faults for circuits that are up to 5 times larger than can be solved directly on current hardware.}

ABSTRACT={We provide Ising formulations for many NP-complete and NP-hard problems, including all of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. This collects and extends mappings to the Ising model from partitioning, covering, and satisfiability. In each case, the required number of spins is at most cubic in the size of the problem. This work may be useful in designing adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms.}}

abstract ={The development of small-scale quantum devices raises the question of how to fairly assess and detect quantum speedup. Here, we show how to define and measure quantum speedup and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake such a speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from tests run on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. By using random spin glass instances as a benchmark, we found no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered and obtained inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate the subtle nature of the quantum speedup question.},

	abstract = {Molecular nanomagnets, often called single-molecule magnets, have attracted much interest in recent years both from experimental and theoretical point of view. These systems are organometallic clusters characterised by a large spin ground state with a predominant uniaxial anisotropy. The quantum nature of these systems makes them very appealing for phenomena occurring on the mesoscopic scale, i.e., at the boundary between classical and quantum physics. Below their blocking temperature, they exhibit magnetisation hysteresis, the classical macroscale property of a magnet, as well as quantum tunnelling of magnetisation and quantum phase interference, the properties of a microscale entity. Quantum effects are advantageous for some potential applications of single-molecule magnets, e.g., in providing the quantum superposition of states for quantum computing, but are a disadvantage in others such as information storage. It is believed that single-molecule magnets have a potential for quantum computation, in particular because they are extremely small and almost identical, allowing to obtain, in a single measurement, statistical averages of a larger number of qubits. This review introduces some basic concepts that are needed to understand the quantum phenomena observed in molecular nanomagnets and discusses new trends of the field of molecular nanomagnets towards molecular spintronics.},

  abstract={We develop from first principles Markovian master equations suited for studying the time evolution of a system evolving adiabatically while coupled weakly to a thermal bath. We derive two sets of equations in the adiabatic limit, one using the rotating wave (secular) approximation that results in a master equation in Lindblad form, the other without the rotating wave approximation but not in Lindblad form. The two equations make markedly different predictions depending on whether or not the Lamb shift is included. Our analysis keeps track of the various time and energy scales associated with the various approximations we make, and thus allows for a systematic inclusion of higher order corrections, in particular beyond the adiabatic limit. We use our formalism to study the evolution of an Ising spin chain in a transverse field and coupled to a thermal bosonic bath, for which we identify four distinct evolution phases. While we do not expect this to be a generic feature, in one of these phases dissipation acts to increase the fidelity of the system state relative to the adiabatic ground state.}

However, for these sizes the minimum energy gaps of most instances are fairly large, so the good performance scaling seen for small problems may not reflect asymptotic behavior where costs are dominated by tiny gaps. Moreover, the resulting search costs are much higher than for other methods. Variants of the quantum algorithm that do not match the adiabatic limit give lower costs, on average, and slower growth than the conventional {GSAT} heuristic method.},

	abstract = {Many artificial intelligence {(AI)} problems naturally map to {NP-hard} optimization problems. This has the interesting consequence that enabling human-level capability in machines often requires systems that can handle formally intractable problems. This issue can sometimes (but possibly not always) be resolved by building special-purpose heuristic algorithms, tailored to the problem in question. Because of the continued difficulties in automating certain tasks that are natural for humans, there remains a strong motivation for {AI} researchers to investigate and apply new algorithms and techniques to hard {AI} problems. Recently a novel class of relevant algorithms that require quantum mechanical hardware have been proposed. These algorithms, referred to as quantum adiabatic algorithms, represent a new approach to designing both complete and heuristic solvers for {NP-hard} optimization problems. In this work we describe how to formulate image recognition, which is a canonical {NP-hard} {AI} problem, as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization {(QUBO)} problem. The {QUBO} format corresponds to the input format required for {D-Wave} superconducting adiabatic quantum computing {(AQC)} processors.},

	abstract = {In a previous publication we proposed discrete global optimization as a method to train a strong binary classifier constructed as a thresholded sum over weak classifiers. Our motivation was to cast the training of a classifier into a format amenable to solution by the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Applying adiabatic quantum computing {(AQC)} promises to yield solutions that are superior to those which can be achieved with classical heuristic solvers. Interestingly we found that by using heuristic solvers to obtain approximate solutions we could already gain an advantage over the standard method {AdaBoost.} In this communication we generalize the baseline method to large scale classifier training. By large scale we mean that either the cardinality of the dictionary of candidate weak classifiers or the number of weak learners used in the strong classifier exceed the number of variables that can be handled effectively in a single global optimization. For such situations we propose an iterative and piecewise approach in which a subset of weak classifiers is selected in each iteration via global optimization. The strong classifier is then constructed by concatenating the subsets of weak classifiers. We show in numerical studies that the generalized method again successfully competes with {AdaBoost.} We also provide theoretical arguments as to why the proposed optimization method, which does not only minimize the empirical loss but also adds L0-norm regularization, is superior to versions of boosting that only minimize the empirical loss. By conducting a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation we gather evidence that the quantum adiabatic algorithm is able to handle a generic training problem efficiently.},

Proteins are modeled as copolymers of specific sequences of hydrophobic {(H)} and polar {(P)} monomers {(HP} model) configured as self-avoiding flights on simple three-dimensional cubic lattices. The model has no parameters; we just seek the conformations that have the global maximum number of {HH} contacts for any given sequence. Finding global optima for chains in this model has not been computationally possible before for chains longer than 36-mers. We report here a procedure that can find all the globally optimal conformations, the number of which defines the degeneracy of a sequence, for chains up to 88 monomers long. It is about 37 orders of magnitude faster than previous exact methods. We find that degeneracy is an important aspect of sequence design. So far, we have found that four-helix bundles, alpha/beta-barrels, and parallel beta-helices are globally optimal conformations of polar/nonpolar sequences that have minimal degeneracy.},

The goals of this theory are to serve as a simple formalism for gaining deeper insight into the physical properties seen in detailed simulations as well as to serve as a model to easily compare why these simulations suggest a different kinetic mechanism than previous simple models. Specifically, we find that non-native contacts play a key role in determining the mechanism, which can shift dramatically as the energetic strength of non-native interactions is changed. For proteinlike non-native interactions, our model finds that the native state is a kinetic hub, connecting the strength of relevant interactions directly to the nature of folding kinetics.},

This communication describes a physical model of beads-on-a-string, based on the folding of flexible strings of electrostatically charged beads in two dimensions. The system comprises millimeter-scale Teflon and Nylon-6,6 (spherical or cylindrical) beads (Ë 6 mm in diameter) separated by smaller (Ë3 mm) poly(methyl methacrylate) {(PMMA)} spherical beads, threaded on a flexible string. The smaller, uncharged beads define the distances between the larger beads, and control the flexibility of the string. During agitation of the sequence of beads on a planar, horizontal paper surface, tribocharging generates opposite electrostatic charges on the larger Nylon and Teflon beads, but leaves the smaller {PMMA} beads essentially uncharged; the resulting electrostatic interactions cause the string to fold. Examination and comparison of two modelsâone physical and one theoreticalâmay offer a new approach to understanding folding, collapse, and molecular recognition at an abstract level, with particular opportunity to explore the influence of the flexibility of the string and the shape of the beads on the pattern and rate of folding. The physical system is, thus, an analog computer, simulating the theoretical beads-on-a-string model in two dimensions; this system makes it possible to test hypotheses connecting âsequenceâ to âfoldingâ, rapidly and conveniently, while exploring nonlinearities and other complexities omitted from the theoretical model.},

	abstract = {Attractive inter-residue contact energies for proteins have been re-evaluated with the same assumptions and approximations used originally by us in 1985, but with a significantly larger set of protein crystal structures. An additional repulsive packing energy term, operative at higher densities to prevent overpacking, has also been estimated for all 20 amino acids as a function of the number of contacting residues, based on their observed distributions. The two terms of opposite sign are intended to be used together to provide an estimate of the overall energies of inter-residue interactions in simplified proteins without atomic details. To overcome the problem of how to utilize the many homologous proteins in the Protein Data Bank, a new scheme has been devised to assign different weights to each protein, based on similarities among amino acid sequences. A total of 1168 protein structures containing 1661 subunit sequences are actually used here. After the sequence weights have been applied, these correspond to an effective number of residue-residue contacts of 113,914, or about six times more than were used in the old analysis. Remarkably, the new attractive contact energies are nearly identical to the old ones, except for those with Leu and the rarer amino acids Trp and Met. The largest change found for Leu is surprising. The estimates of hydrophobicity from the contact energies for non-polar side-chains agree well with the experimental values. In an application of these contact energies, the sequences of 88 structurally distinct proteins in the Protein Data Bank are threaded at all possible positions without gaps into 189 different folds of proteins whose sequences differ from each other by at least 35\% sequence identity. The native structures for 73 of 88 proteins, excluding 15 exceptional proteins such as membrane proteins, are all demonstrated to have the lowest alignment energies.},

picking random clauses all consistent with two disparate planted solutions and

randomly modifying the beginning Hamiltonian, one obtains (with substantial
probability) an adiabatic path that removes this difficulty. This suggests that
the quantum adiabatic algorithm should in general be run on each instance with
many different random paths leading to the problem Hamiltonian. We do not know
whether this trick will help for a random instance of {3SAT} (as opposed to an
instance from the particular set we consider), especially if the instance has
an exponential number of disparate assignments that violate few clauses. We use
a continuous imaginary time Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in a novel way to
numerically investigate the ground state as well as the first excited state of
our system. Our arguments are supplemented by Quantum Monte Carlo data from

We define {'Adiabatic} State Generation' {(ASG),} which is based on Hamiltonians instead of unitary gates. We develop tools for {ASG} including a very general method for implementing Hamiltonians {(The} sparse Hamiltonian lemma), and ways to guarantee non negligible spectral gaps {(The} jagged adiabatic path lemma). We also prove that {ASG} is equivalent in power to state generation in the standard quantum model. After setting the foundations for {ASG,} we show how to apply our techniques to generate interesting superpositions related to Markov {chains.The} {ASG} approach to quantum algorithms provides intriguing links between quantum computation and many different areas: the analysis of spectral gaps and groundstates of Hamiltonians in physics, rapidly mixing Markov chains, statistical zero knowledge, and quantum random walks.

	abstract = {Understanding {NP-complete} problems is a central topic in computer science {(NP} stands for nondeterministic polynomial time). This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle {NP-complete} problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computerâs Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of {NP-complete} problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: The system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima.},

	abstract = {The problem Hamiltonian of the adiabatic quantum algorithm for the maximum-weight independent set problem {(MIS)} that is based on the reduction to the Ising problem (as described in {[Choi08])} has flexible parameters. We show that by choosing the parameters appropriately in the problem Hamiltonian (without changing the problem to be solved) for {MIS} on {CK} graphs, we can prevent the first order quantum phase transition and significantly change the minimum spectral gap. We raise the basic question about what the appropriate formulation of adiabatic running time should be. We also describe adiabatic quantum algorithms for Exact Cover and {3SAT} in which the problem Hamiltonians are based on the reduction to {MIS.} We point out that the argument in Altshuler et {al.(arXiv:0908.2782} [quant-ph]) that their adiabatic quantum algorithm failed with high probability for randomly generated instances of Exact Cover does not carry over to this new algorithm.},

	abstract = {We construct a set of instances of {3SAT} which are not solved efficiently using the simplest quantum adiabatic algorithm. These instances are obtained by picking random clauses all consistent with two disparate planted solutions and then penalizing one of them with a single additional clause. We argue that by randomly modifying the beginning Hamiltonian, one obtains (with substantial probability) an adiabatic path that removes this difficulty. This suggests that the quantum adiabatic algorithm should in general be run on each instance with many different random paths leading to the problem Hamiltonian. We do not know whether this trick will help for a random instance of {3SAT} (as opposed to an instance from the particular set we consider), especially if the instance has an exponential number of disparate assignments that violate few clauses. We use a continuous imaginary time Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in a novel way to numerically investigate the ground state as well as the first excited state of our system. Our arguments are supplemented by Quantum Monte Carlo data from simulations with up to 150 spins.},

	abstract = {Two recent preprints {[B.} Altshuler, H. Krovi, and J. Roland, {"Quantum} adiabatic optimization fails for random instances of {NP-complete} problems", {arXiv:0908.2782} and {"Anderson} localization casts clouds over adiabatic quantum optimization", {arXiv:0912.0746]} argue that random 4th order perturbative corrections to the energies of local minima of random instances of {NP-complete} problem lead to avoided crossings that cause the failure of quantum adiabatic algorithm (due to exponentially small gap) close to the end, for very small transverse field that scales as an inverse power of instance size N. The theoretical portion of this work does not to take into account the exponential degeneracy of the ground and excited states at zero field. A corrected analysis shows that unlike those in the middle of the spectrum, avoided crossings at the edge would require high {[O(1)]} transverse fields, at which point the perturbation theory may become divergent due to quantum phase transition. This effect manifests itself only in large instances [exp(0.02 N) {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1], which might be the reason it had not been observed in the authors' numerical work. While we dispute the proposed mechanism of failure of quantum adiabatic algorithm, we cannot draw any conclusions on its ultimate complexity.},

	abstract = {We have designed, fabricated and tested an {XY-addressable} readout system that is specifically tailored for the reading of superconducting flux qubits in an integrated circuit that could enable adiabatic quantum optimization. In such a system, the flux qubits only need to be read at the end of an adiabatic evolution when quantum mechanical tunneling has been suppressed, thus simplifying many aspects of the readout process. The readout architecture for an {\$N\$-qubit} adiabatic quantum optimization system comprises {\$N\$} hysteretic dc {SQUIDs} and {\$N\$} rf {SQUID} latches controlled by {\$2{\textbackslash}sqrt{N}} + 2\$ bias lines. The latching elements are coupled to the qubits and the dc {SQUIDs} are then coupled to the latching elements. This readout scheme provides two key advantages: First, the latching elements provide exceptional flux sensitivity that significantly exceeds what may be achieved by directly coupling the flux qubits to the dc {SQUIDs} using a practical mutual inductance. Second, the states of the latching elements are robust against the influence of ac currents generated by the switching of the hysteretic dc {SQUIDs,} thus allowing one to interrogate the latching elements repeatedly so as to mitigate the effects of stochastic switching of the dc {SQUIDs.} We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve single qubit errors rates of \${\textless}10{\textasciicircum}{-6}\$ with this readout scheme. We have characterized the system-level performance of a 128-qubit readout system and have measured an error probability of \$8{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}{-5}\$ in the presence of optimal latching element bias conditions.},

We also introduce an example of a two-level system with an exactly solvable evolution to demonstrate the inapplicability of the adiabatic approximation for a particular slowly varying Hamiltonian.},

It was known that the problem is {QMA-complete} for any k {\textbackslash}textless= 3. On the other hand 1-local Hamiltonian is in P, and hence not believed to be {QMA-complete.} The complexity of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and show that it is {QMA-complete.} We provide two independent proofs; our first proof uses only elementary linear algebra. Our second proof uses a powerful technique for analyzing the sum of two Hamiltonians; this technique is based on perturbation theory and we believe that it might prove useful elsewhere. Using our techniques we also show that adiabatic computation with two-local interactions on qubits is equivalent to standard quantum computation.},

We apply this method to the Grover's problem, i.e., searching a marked item in an unstructured database. Classically, the problem can be solved only in a running time of {orderO(N)} {(whereNis} the number of items in the database), whereas in the quantum model a speed up of orderhas been obtained. We show that in the adiabatic quantum model, by a suitable choice of the time-dependent Hamiltonian, it is possible to do the calculation in constant time, independent of the the number of items in the database.

The analytic result for Shorâs algorithm shows a linear scaling of the entropy in terms of the number of qubits, therefore making it hard to generate an efficient classical simulation protocol. A similar result is obtained numerically for the quantum adiabatic evolution exact cover algorithm, which also shows universality of the quantum phase transition near which the system evolves. On the other hand, entanglement in Groverâs adiabatic algorithm remains a bounded quantity even at the critical point. The classification of scaling of entanglement appears as a natural grading of the computational complexity of simulating quantum phase transitions.},

	Abstract = {The computational cost of exact methods for quantum simulation using classical computers grows exponentially with system size. As a consequence, these techniques can be applied only to small systems. By contrast, we demonstrate that quantum computers could exactly simulate chemical reactions in polynomial time. Our algorithm uses the split-operator approach and explicitly simulates all electron-nuclear and interelectronic interactions in quadratic time. Surprisingly, this treatment is not only more accurate than the Born-Oppenheimer approximation but faster and more efficient as well, for all reactions with more than about four atoms. This is the case even though the entire electronic wave function is propagated on a grid with appropriately short time steps. Although the preparation and measurement of arbitrary states on a quantum computer is inefficient, here we demonstrate how to prepare states of chemical interest efficiently. We also show how to efficiently obtain chemically relevant observables, such as state-to-state transition probabilities and thermal reaction rates. Quantum computers using these techniques could outperform current classical computers with 100 qubits.},

	Abstract = { The difficulty of simulating quantum systems, well known to quantum chemists, prompted the idea of quantum computation. One can avoid the steep scaling associated with the exact simulation of increasingly large quantum systems on conventional computers, by mapping the quantum system to another, more controllable one. In this review, we discuss to what extent the ideas in quantum computation, now a well-established field, have been applied to chemical problems. We describe algorithms that achieve significant advantages for the electronic-structure problem, the simulation of chemical dynamics, protein folding, and other tasks. Although theory is still ahead of experiment, we outline recent advances that have led to the first chemical calculations on small quantum information processors. },

In a finite two-dimensional lattice these problems can be solved by algorithms that require a number of steps bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the lattice. In contrast to this fact, the same problems are shown to belong to the class of NP-hard problems, both in the two-dimensional case within a magnetic field, and in the three-dimensional case. NP-hardness of a problem suggests that it is very unlikely that a polynomial algorithm could exist to solve it.}

	Abstract = {This paper deals with fully connected mean-field models of quantum spins with p -body ferromagnetic interactions and a transverse field. For p = 2 this corresponds to the quantum Curie--Weiss model (a special case of the Lipkin--Meshkov--Glick model) which exhibits a second-order phase transition, while for p > 2 the transition is first order. We provide a refined analytical description both of the static and of the dynamic properties of these models. In particular we obtain analytically the exponential rate of decay of the gap at the first-order transition. We also study the slow annealing from the pure transverse field to the pure ferromagnet (and vice versa) and discuss the effect of the first-order transition and of the spinodal limit of metastability on the residual excitation energy, both for finite and exponentially divergent annealing times. In the quantum computation perspective this quantity would assess the efficiency of the quantum adiabatic procedure as an approximation algorithm.},

By comparing classical and quantum Monte Carlo annealing protocols on the two-dimensional random Ising model (a prototype spin glass), we confirm the superiority of quantum annealing relative to classical annealing. We also propose a theory of quantum annealing based on a cascade of Landau-Zener tunneling events. For both classical and quantum annealing, the residual energy after annealing is inversely proportional to a power of the logarithm of the annealing time, but the quantum case has a larger power that makes it faster.},

	Abstract = {Quantum technology is maturing to the point where quantum devices, such as quantum communication systems, quantum random number generators and quantum simulators may be built with capabilities exceeding classical computers. A quantum annealer, in particular, solves optimization problems by evolving a known initial configuration at non-zero temperature towards the ground state of a Hamiltonian encoding a given problem. Here, we present results from tests on a 108 qubit D-Wave One device based on superconducting flux qubits. By studying correlations we find that the device performance is inconsistent with classical annealing or that it is governed by classical spin dynamics. In contrast, we find that the device correlates well with simulated quantum annealing. We find further evidence for quantum annealing in the form of small-gap avoided level crossings characterizing the hard problems. To assess the computational power of the device we compare it against optimized classical algorithms.},

Strong evidence for superiority of quantum annealing (QA) has come from comparing QA implemented through quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to classical annealing. Motivated by recent experiments, we revisit the question of when quantum speedup may be expected. Although a better scaling is seen for QA in two-dimensional Ising spin glasses, this advantage is due to time discretization artifacts and measurements that are not possible on a physical quantum annealer. Simulations in the physically relevant continuous time limit, on the other hand, do not show superiority. Our results imply that care must be taken when using QMC simulations to assess the potential for quantum speedup.},

This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer?s Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: The system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima.},

	Abstract = {Quantum annealing is a promising tool for solving optimization problems, similar in some ways to the traditional (classical) simulated annealing of Kirkpatrick et al. Simulated annealing takes advantage of thermal fluctuations in order to explore the optimization landscape of the problem at hand, whereas quantum annealing employs quantum fluctuations. Intriguingly, quantum annealing has been proved to be more effective than its classical counterpart in many applications. We illustrate the theory and the practical implementation of both classical and quantum annealing -- highlighting the crucial differences between these two methods -- by means of results recently obtained in experiments, in simple toy-models, and more challenging combinatorial optimization problems (namely, Random Ising model and Travelling Salesman Problem). The techniques used to implement quantum and classical annealing are either deterministic evolutions, for the simplest models, or Monte Carlo approaches, for harder optimization tasks. We discuss the pro and cons of these approaches and their possible connections to the landscape of the problem addressed.},

	Abstract = {Consider a path of non-degenerate eigenstates of unitary operators or Hamiltonians with minimum eigenvalue gap G. The eigenpath traversal problem is to transform one or more copies of the initial to the final eigenstate. Solutions to this problem have applications ranging from quantum physics simulation to optimization. For Hamiltonians, the conventional way of doing this is by applying the adiabatic theorem. We give ``digital'' methods for performing the transformation that require no assumption on path continuity or differentiability other than the absence of large jumps. Given sufficient information about eigenvalues and overlaps between states on the path, the transformation can be accomplished with complexity O(L/G log(L/e)), where L is the angular length of the path and e is a specified bound on the error of the output state. We show that the required information can be obtained in a first set of transformations, whose complexity per state transformed has an additional factor that depends logarithmically on a maximum angular velocity along the path. This velocity is averaged over constant angular distances and does not require continuity. Our methods have substantially better behavior than conventional adiabatic algorithms, with fewer conditions on the path. They also improve on the previously best digital methods and demonstrate that path length and the gap are the primary parameters that determine the complexity of state transformation along a path.},

@article{evertz_loop_2003,
	Abstract = {A review of the Loop Algorithm, its generalizations, and its relation to some other Monte Carlo techniques is given. The loop algorithm is a Quantum Monte Carlo procedure which employs nonlocal changes of worldline configurations, determined by local stochastic decisions. It is based on a formulation of quantum models of any dimension in an extended ensemble of worldlines and graphs, and is related to Swendsen-Wang algorithms. It can be represented directly on an operator level, both with a continuous imaginary time path integral and with the stochastic series expansion (SSE). It overcomes many of the difficulties of traditional worldline simulations. Autocorrelations are reduced by orders of magnitude. Grand-canonical ensembles, off-diagonal operators, and variance reduced estimators are accessible. In some cases, infinite systems can be simulated. For a restricted class of models, the fermion sign problem can be overcome. Transverse magnetic fields are handled efficiently, in contrast to strong diagonal ones. The method has been applied successfully to a variety of models for spin and charge degrees of freedom, including Heisenberg and XYZ spin models, hard-core bosons, Hubbard, and tJ-models. Due to the improved efficiency, precise calculations of asymptotic behavior and of quantum critical exponents have been possible.},

First, we identify a large class of quantum Hamiltonians describing systems of qubits for which the adiabatic evolution can be efficiently simulated on a classical probabilistic computer. These are stoquastic local Hamiltonians with a âfrustration-freeâ ground-state. A Hamiltonian belongs to this class iff it can be represented as \$H={\textbackslash}sum\_\{a\}H\_\{a\}\$ where (1) every term \$H\_\{a\}\$ acts nontrivially on a constant number of qubits, (2) every term \$H\_\{a\}\$ has real nonpositive off-diagonal matrix elements in the standard basis, and (3) the ground-state of H is a ground-state of every term \$H\_\{a\}\$. Second, we generalize the CookâLevin theorem proving NP-completeness of the satisfiability problem to the complexity class MA (MerlinâArthur games)âa probabilistic analogue of NP. Specifically, we construct a quantum version of the k-SAT problem which we call âstoquastic k-SATâ such that stoquastic k-SAT is contained in MA for any constant k, and any promise problem in MA is Karp-reducible to stoquastic 6-SAT. This result provides the first nontrivial example of a MA-complete promise problem.},

Here we consider the problem of estimating the ground state energy of a local stoquastic Hamiltonian H with a promise that the ground state of H has a non-negligible correlation with some 'guiding' state that admits a concise classical description. A formalized version of this problem called Guided Stoquastic Hamiltonian is shown to be complete for the complexity class MA (a probabilistic analogue of NP). To prove this result we employ the Projection Monte Carlo algorithm with a variable number of walkers. Secondly, we show that the ground state and thermal equilibrium properties of the ferromagnetic TIM can be simulated in polynomial time on a classical probabilistic computer.

	abstract = {Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) is a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm that samples the equilibrium thermal state of a Quantum Annealing (QA) Hamiltonian. In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been proposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial optimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases it remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA. One piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing comes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric cost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an exponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal fluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing which passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time, arguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling. In this work we apply a comparison method to rigorously show that the Markov chain underlying SQA efficiently samples the target distribution and finds the global minimum of this spike cost function in polynomial time. Our work provides evidence for the growing consensus that SQA inherits at least some of the advantages of tunneling in QA, and so QA is unlikely to achieve exponential speedups over classical computing solely by the use of quantum tunneling. Since we analyze only a particular model this evidence is not decisive. However, techniques applied here---including warm starts from the adiabatic path and the use of the quantum ground state probability distribution to understand the stationary distribution of SQA---may be valuable for future studies of the performance of SQA on cost functions for which QA is efficient.},

Further approximation algorithms are presented for the mean energy and the mean magnetic moment of ferromagnetic Ising systems.The algorithms are based on Monte Carlo simulation of a suitably defined ergodic Markov chain. The states of the chain are not, as is customary, Ising spin configurations, but spanning subgraphs of the interaction graph of the system. It is shown that the expectations of simple operators on these configurations give numerical information about the partition function and related quantities.The performance guarantees for the algorithms are rigorously derived and rest on the fact that the Markov chain in question is rapidly mixing, i.e., converges to its equilibrium distribution in a polynomial number of steps. This is apparently the first time that rapid mixing has been demonstrated at all temperatures for a Markov chain related to the Ising model.},

We study a physical system -- the Ising quantum chain with alternating sector interaction defects, but constant transverse field -- which is equivalent to applying the quantum adiabatic algorithm to a particular SAT problem. We prove that for a constant range of values for the transverse field, the spectral gap is exponentially small in the sector length.

In this work we study the efficiency of the adiabatic algorithm for solving the "the Hamming weight with a spike" problem by using several methods to compute the scaling of the spectral gap at the critical point, which apply for various ranges of the height and width of the barrier. Our main result is a rigorous polynomial lower bound on the minimum spectral gap for the adiabatic evolution when the bit-symmetric cost function has a thin but polynomially high barrier. This is accomplished by the use of a variational argument with an improved ansatz for the ground state, along with a comparison to the spectrum of the system when no spike term is present. We also give a more detailed treatment of the spin coherent path-integral instanton method which was used by Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann in arXiv:quant-ph/0201031, and consider its applicability for estimating the gap for different scalings of barrier height and width. We adapt the discrete WKB method for an abruptly changing potential, and apply it to the construction of approximate wave functions which can be used to estimate the gap. Finally, the improved ansatz for the ground state leads to a method for predicting the location of avoided crossings in the excited states of the energy spectrum of the thin spike Hamiltonian, and we use a recursion relation to determine the ordering of some of these avoided crossings, which may be a useful step towards understanding the diabatic cascade phenomenon which occurs in spike Hamiltonians.},

We present evidence that SQA can pass through this barrier to find the global minimum efficiently. This demonstrates the potential for SQA to inherit some of the advantages of quantum annealing (QA), since this problem has been previously shown to be efficiently solvable by quantum adiabatic optimization.},

The dynamical behavior of the quantum and the classical annealing are compared, showing important qualitative differences in the way of exploring the complex energy landscape of the combinatorial optimization problem. At variance with the results obtained for the Ising spin glass and for the traveling salesman problem, in the present case the linear-schedule quantum annealing performance is definitely worse than classical annealing. Nevertheless, a quantum cooling protocol based on field-cycling and able to outperform standard classical simulated annealing over short time scales is introduced.},

	abstract = {We review here some recent work in the field of quantum annealing, alias adiabatic quantum computation. The idea of quantum annealing is to perform optimization by a quantum adiabatic evolution which tracks the ground state of a suitable time-dependent Hamiltonian, where '' is slowly switched off. We illustrate several applications of quantum annealing strategies, starting from textbook toy-models--double-well potentials and other one-dimensional examples, with and without disorder. These examples display in a clear way the crucial differences between classical and quantum annealing. We then discuss applications of quantum annealing to challenging hard optimization problems, such as the random Ising model, the travelling salesman problem and Boolean satisfiability problems. The techniques used to implement quantum annealing are either deterministic SchrÃ¶dinger's evolutions, for the toy models, or path-integral Monte Carlo and Green's function Monte Carlo approaches, for the hard optimization problems. The crucial role played by disorder and the associated non-trivial Landau-Zener tunnelling phenomena is discussed and emphasized.},

@article{Anthony16,
	Abstract = {Very large nonlinear unconstrained binary optimization problems arise in a broad array of applications. Several exact or heuristic techniques have proved quite successful for solving many of these problems when the objective function is a quadratic polynomial. However, no similarly efficient methods are available for the higher degree case. Since high degree objectives are becoming increasingly important in certain application areas, such as computer vision, various techniques have been recently developed to reduce the general case to the quadratic one, at the cost of increasing the number of variables by introducing additional auxiliary variables. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of these quadratization approaches. We provide tight lower and upper bounds on the number of auxiliary variables needed in the worst-case for general objective functions, for bounded-degree functions, and for a restricted class of quadratizations. Our upper bounds are constructive, thus yielding new quadratization procedures. Finally, we completely characterize all ``minimal'' quadratizations of negative monomials.},

	Abstract = {Quantum tunnelling is a phenomenon in which a quantum state traverses energy barriers higher than the energy of the state itself. Quantum tunnelling has been hypothesized as an advantageous physical resource for optimization in quantum annealing. However, computational multiqubit tunnelling has not yet been observed, and a theory of co-tunnelling under high- and low-frequency noises is lacking. Here we show that 8-qubit tunnelling plays a computational role in a currently available programmable quantum annealer. We devise a probe for tunnelling, a computational primitive where classical paths are trapped in a false minimum. In support of the design of quantum annealers we develop a nonperturbative theory of open quantum dynamics under realistic noise characteristics. This theory accurately predicts the rate of many-body dissipative quantum tunnelling subject to the polaron effect. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that quantum tunnelling outperforms thermal hopping along classical paths for problems with up to 200 qubits containing the computational primitive.},

Quantum tunneling provides a different mechanism for moving between states, with the potential for reduced time scales. Thermal and quantum annealing are compared in a model disordered magnet, where the effects of quantum mechanics can be tuned by varying an applied magnetic field.

@article{Heim15,
	Abstract = {Finding a solution to a problem often amounts to an optimization problem and thus can be recast in terms of the lowest-energy state of a system. To find such ground states, mathematical methods based on annealing were developed. To reach the ground state more quickly than with the earlier classical methods, a quantum-mechanical approach was proposed; however, the evidence for quantum speed-up is contradictory. Heim et al. show that the results depend on how the problem is described and how the optimization routine is implemented. This development should be valuable for benchmarking quantum machines.Science, this issue p. 215 Quantum annealers use quantum fluctuations to escape local minima and find low-energy configurations of a physical system. Strong evidence for superiority of quantum annealing (QA) has come from comparing QA implemented through quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to classical annealing. Motivated by recent experiments, we revisit the question of when quantum speedup may be expected. Although a better scaling is seen for QA in two-dimensional Ising spin glasses, this advantage is due to time discretization artifacts and measurements that are not possible on a physical quantum annealer. Simulations in the physically relevant continuous time limit, on the other hand, do not show superiority. Our results imply that care must be taken when using QMC simulations to assess the potential for quantum speedup.},

	Abstract = {We consider a family of unstructured optimization problems, for which we propose a method for constructing analogue, continuous-time (not necessarily adiabatic) quantum algorithms that are faster than their classical counterparts. In this family of problems, which we refer to as `scrambled input' problems, one has to find a minimum-cost configuration of a given integer-valued n -bit black-box function whose input values have been scrambled in some unknown way. Special cases within this set of problems are Grover's search problem of finding a marked item in an unstructured database, certain random energy models, and the functions of the Deutsch--Josza problem. We consider a couple of examples in detail. In the first, we provide an O (1) deterministic analogue quantum algorithm to solve the seminal problem of Deutsch and Josza, in which one has to determine whether an n -bit boolean function is constant (gives 0 on all inputs or 1 on all inputs) or balanced (returns 0 on half the input states and 1 on the other half). We also study one variant of the random energy model, and show that, as one might expect, its minimum energy configuration can be found quadratically faster with a quantum adiabatic algorithm than with classical algorithms.},

We show that the proposed algorithm is exponentially faster than its classical counterpart and has the same complexity as the corresponding circuit-based algorithm. Together with other related studies, this result supports a conjecture that the complexity of adiabatic quantum computation is equivalent to the circuit-based computational model in a stronger sense than the well-known, proven polynomial equivalence between the two paradigms. We also discuss the importance of the algorithm and its theoretical and experimental implications for the existence of an adiabatic version of Shor's integer factorization algorithm that would have the same complexity as the original algorithm.},

We divide the possible failure mechanisms into two sets: small gaps due to quantum phase transitions and small gaps due to avoided crossings inside a phase. We argue that the thermodynamic order of the phase transitions is not predictive of the scaling of the gap with the system size. On the contrary, we also argue that, if the phase surrounding the problem Hamiltonian is a Many-Body Localized (MBL) phase, the gaps are going to be typically exponentially small and that this follows naturally from the existence of local integrals of motion in the MBL phase.},

	Abstract = {Quantum annealers are physical devices that aim at solving NP-complete optimization problems by exploiting quantum mechanics. The basic principle of quantum annealing is to encode the optimization problem in Ising interactions between quantum bits (qubits). A fundamental challenge in building a fully programmable quantum annealer is the competing requirements of full controllable all-to-all connectivity and the quasi-locality of the interactions between physical qubits. We present a scalable architecture with full connectivity, which can be implemented with local interactions only. The input of the optimization problem is encoded in local fields acting on an extended set of physical qubits. The output is{\textemdash}in the spirit of topological quantum memories{\textemdash}redundantly encoded in the physical qubits, resulting in an intrinsic fault tolerance. Our model can be understood as a lattice gauge theory, where long-range interactions are mediated by gauge constraints. The architecture can be realized on various platforms with local controllability, including superconducting qubits, NV-centers, quantum dots, and atomic systems.},

@article{Santoro06,
	Abstract = {We review here some recent work in the field of quantum annealing, alias adiabatic quantum computation. The idea of quantum annealing is to perform optimization by a quantum adiabatic evolution which tracks the ground state of a suitable time-dependent Hamiltonian, where ' ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/planck.gif] {planck} ' is slowly switched off. We illustrate several applications of quantum annealing strategies, starting from textbook toy-models---double-well potentials and other one-dimensional examples, with and without disorder. These examples display in a clear way the crucial differences between classical and quantum annealing. We then discuss applications of quantum annealing to challenging hard optimization problems, such as the random Ising model, the travelling salesman problem and Boolean satisfiability problems. The techniques used to implement quantum annealing are either deterministic Schr{\"o}dinger's evolutions, for the toy models, or path-integral Monte Carlo and Green's function Monte Carlo approaches, for the hard optimization problems. The crucial role played by disorder and the associated non-trivial Landau--Zener tunnelling phenomena is discussed and emphasized.},

We state conditions under which the complexity for approximate convergence is polynomial in n, the number of variables. Approximate convergence takes time O(n log n) as nâ†’âˆž if the target field satisfies certain spatial mixing conditions. Otherwise, if the field has a potential with finite interaction range independent of n, the complexity is exponential in nÎ³, with Î³<1, which is still more favourable than enumerating all the states. When the interaction range grows with n, the algorithms can converge exponentially in n. Analogous results are provided for an expectation approximated by an average along the chain.},

  abstract={We develop from first principles Markovian master equations suited for studying the time evolution of a system evolving adiabatically while coupled weakly to a thermal bath. We derive two sets of equations in the adiabatic limit, one using the rotating wave (secular) approximation that results in a master equation in Lindblad form, the other without the rotating wave approximation but not in Lindblad form. The two equations make markedly different predictions depending on whether or not the Lamb shift is included. Our analysis keeps track of the various time and energy scales associated with the various approximations we make, and thus allows for a systematic inclusion of higher order corrections, in particular beyond the adiabatic limit. We use our formalism to study the evolution of an Ising spin chain in a transverse field and coupled to a thermal bosonic bath, for which we identify four distinct evolution phases. While we do not expect this to be a generic feature, in one of these phases dissipation acts to increase the fidelity of the system state relative to the adiabatic ground state.}

  abstract = {We study an expansion of the log-likelihood in undirected graphical models such as the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), where each term in the expansion is associated with a sample in a Gibbs chain alternating between two random variables (the visible vector and the hidden vector, in RBMs). We are particularly interested in estimators of the gradient of the log-likelihood obtained through this expansion. We show that its residual term converges to zero, justifying the use of a truncation, i.e. running only a short Gibbs chain, which is the main idea behind the Contrastive Divergence (CD) estimator of the log-likelihood gradient. By truncating even more, we obtain a stochastic reconstruction error, related through a mean-field approximation to the reconstruction error often used to train autoassociators and stacked auto-associators.  The derivation is not specific to the particular parametric forms used in RBMs, and only requires convergence of the Gibbs chain. We present theoretical and empirical evidence linking the number of Gibbs steps $k$ and the magnitude of the RBM parameters to the bias in the CD estimator. These experiments also suggest that the sign of the CD estimator is correct most of the time, even when the bias is large, so that CD-$k$ is a good descent direction even for small $k$.}

 explanations of data containing random errors. We argue that assessing

 well-founded model selection procedure. We formulate model complexity
 in terms of the geometry of the space of probability distributions.
 Geometric complexity provides a clear intuitive understanding of
 several extant notions of model complexity. This approach allows us to
 reconceptualize the model selection problem as one of counting
 explanations that lie close to the â€œtruth.â€ We demonstrate the
 usefulness of the approach by applying it to the recovery of models in
 psychophysics.},

  abstract={Finding the optimal assignment in budget-constrained auctions is a combinatorial optimization problem with many important applications, a notable example being in the sale of advertisement space by search engines (in this context the problem is often referred to as the off-line AdWords problem). On the basis of the cavity method of statistical mechanics, we introduce a message-passing algorithm that is capable of solving efficiently random instances of the problem extracted from a natural distribution, and we derive from its properties the phase diagram of the problem. As the control parameter (average value of the budgets) is varied, we find two phase transitions delimiting a region in which long-range correlations arise.}

  pages={P10012},
  year={2011},
  abstract={Advanced inference techniques allow one to reconstruct a pattern of interaction from high dimensional data sets, from probing simultaneously thousands of units of extended systemsâ€”such as cells, neural tissues and financial markets. We focus here on the statistical properties of inferred models and argue that inference procedures are likely to yield models which are close to singular values of parameters, akin to critical points in physics where phase transitions occur. These are points where the response of physical systems to external perturbations, as measured by the susceptibility, is very large and diverges in the limit of infinite size. We show that the reparameterization invariant metrics in the space of probability distributions of these models (the Fisher information) are directly related to the susceptibility of the inferred model. As a result, distinguishable models tend to accumulate close to critical points, where the susceptibility diverges in infinite systems. This region is the one where the estimate of inferred parameters is most stable. In order to illustrate these points, we discuss inference of interacting point processes with application to financial data and show that sensible choices of observation time scales naturally yield models which are close to criticality.}

We show the existence of an intermediate phase below Î±c, where the proliferation of metastable states is responsible for the onset of complexity in search algorithms. We introduce a class of optimization algorithms that can deal with these metastable states; one such algorithm has been tested successfully on the largest existing benchmark of K-satisfiability.},

    ABSTRACT={This paper discusses techniques for solving discrete optimization problems using quantum annealing. Practical issues likely to affect the computation include precision limitations, finite temperature, bounded energy range, sparse connectivity, and small numbers of qubits. To address these concerns we propose a way of finding energy representations with large classical gaps between ground and first excited states, efficient algorithms for mapping non-compatible Ising models into the hardware, and the use of decomposition methods for problems that are too large to fit in hardware. We validate the approach by describing experiments with D-Wave quantum hardware for low density parity check decoding with up to 1000 variables.}

	Abstract = {Quantum annealing provides a way of solving optimization problems by encoding them as Ising spin models which are implemented using physical qubits. The solution of the optimization problem then corresponds to the ground state of the system. Quantum tunneling is harnessed to enable the system to move to the ground state in a potentially high non-convex energy landscape. A major difficulty in encoding optimization problems in physical quantum annealing devices is the fact that many real world optimization problems require interactions of higher connectivity, as well as multi-body terms beyond the limitations of the physical hardware. In this work we address the question of how to implement multi-body interactions using hardware which natively only provides two-body interactions. The main result is an efficient circuit design of such multi-body terms using superconducting flux qubits in which effective N-body interactions are implemented using N ancilla qubits and only two inductive couplers. It is then shown how this circuit can be used as the unit cell of a scalable architecture by applying it to a recently proposed embedding technique for constructing an architecture of logical qubits with arbitrary connectivity using physical qubits which have nearest-neighbor four-body interactions. It is further shown that this design is robust to non-linear effects in the coupling loops, as well as mismatches in some of the circuit parameters.},

  abstract={I describe how real quantum annealers may be used to perform local (in state space) searches around specified states, rather than the global searches traditionally implemented in the quantum annealing algorithm (QAA). Such protocols will have numerous advantages over simple quantum annealing. By using such searches the effect of problem mis-specification can be reduced, as only energy differences between the searched states will be relevant. The QAA is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical numerical technique which has now been superseded. Hence, I explore two strategies to use an annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization algorithms. Specifically, I show how sequential calls to quantum annealers can be used to construct analogues of population annealing and parallel tempering which use quantum searches as subroutines. The techniques given here can be applied not only to optimization, but also to sampling. I examine the feasibility of these protocols on real devices and note that implementing such protocols should require minimal if any change to the current design of the flux qubit-based annealers by D-Wave Systems Inc. I further provide proof-of-principle numerical experiments based on quantum Monte Carlo that demonstrate simple examples of the discussed techniques.}

	Abstract = {Non-stoquastic Hamiltonians have both positive and negative signs in off-diagonal elements in their matrix representation in the standard computational basis and thus cannot be simulated efficiently by the standard quantum Monte Carlo method due to the sign problem.  We describe our analytical studies of this type of Hamiltonians with infinite-range non-random as well as random interactions from the perspective of possible enhancement of the efficiency of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computing.  It is shown that multi-body transverse interactions like XX and XXXXX with positive coefficients appended to a stoquastic transverse-field Ising model render the Hamiltonian non-stoquastic and reduce a first-order quantum phase transition in the simple transverse-field case to a second-order transition.  This implies that the efficiency of quantum annealing is exponentially enhanced, because a first-order transition has an exponentially small energy gap (and therefore exponentially long computation time) whereas a second-order transition has a polynomially decaying gap (polynomial computation time).  The examples presented here represent rare instances where strong quantum effects, in the sense that they cannot be efficiently simulated in the standard quantum Monte Carlo, have analytically been shown to exponentially enhance the efficiency of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization problems.},

	abstract = {Deep learning, which describes a class of machine learning algorithms, has recently showed impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data rich, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Problems of this nature may be particularly well-suited to deep learning techniques. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems -- patient classification, fundamental biological processes, and treatment of patients -- to predict whether deep learning will transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. We find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize or definitively resolve any of these problems, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even when improvement over a previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that deep learning methods may speed or aid human investigation. More work is needed to address concerns related to interpretability and how to best model each problem. Furthermore, the limited amount of labeled data for training presents problems in some domains, as can legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning powering changes at the bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

abstract = {Harnessing techniques from analog signal processing, we establish a new path for large-scale quantum computation. We show that parametric coupling techniques can be used to generate selective entangling interactions for multi-qubit processors. By inducing coherent population exchange between adjacent qubits under frequency modulation, we implement a universal gate set for a linear array of four superconducting qubits. An average process fidelity of ℱ = 93\% is estimated for three two-qubit gates via quantum process tomography. We establish the suitability of these techniques for computation by preparing a four-qubit maximally entangled state and comparing the estimated state fidelity with the expected performance of the individual entangling gates. In addition, we prepare an eight-qubit register in all possible bitstring permutations and monitor the fidelity of a two-qubit gate across one pair of these qubits. Across all these permutations, an average fidelity of ℱ = 91.6 ± 2.6\% is observed. These results thus offer a path to a scalable architecture with high selectivity and low cross-talk.}}

But by using a slightly more complicated model than Bell, one can show that even in this simple case where one can make definite predictions, one still cannot generally introduce deterministic, local models to explain the results.",

How does one know that a putative QA device is indeed quantum? How should one go about benchmarking its performance and compare it to classical algorithms? How can its performance be improved by error correction? In this contribution to the focus collection on ‚ÄòWhat would you do with 1000 qubits?‚Äô, we review the work we and others have done in this area, since the first D-Wave quantum annealer with 108 qubits was made available to us. Some of the lessons we have learned will be useful when other quantum computing platforms reach a similar scale, and practitioners will attempt to demonstrate quantum speedup.}

title={Quantum risk analysis},
journal={npj Quantum Information},
year={2019},
volume={5},
number={1},
pages={15},
abstract={We present a quantum algorithm that analyzes risk more efficiently than Monte Carlo simulations traditionally used on classical computers. We employ quantum amplitude estimation to price securities and evaluate risk measures such as Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk on a gate-based quantum computer. Additionally, we show how to implement this algorithm and how to trade-off the convergence rate of the algorithm and the circuit depth. The shortest possible circuit depth--growing polynomially in the number of qubits representing the uncertainty--leads to a convergence rate of O(M-2/3), where M is the number of samples. This is already faster than classical Monte Carlo simulations which converge at a rate of O(M-1/2). If we allow the circuit depth to grow faster, but still polynomially, the convergence rate quickly approaches the optimum of O(M-1). Thus, for slowly increasing circuit depths our algorithm provides a near quadratic speed-up compared to Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate our algorithm using two toy models. In the first model we use real hardware, such as the IBM Q Experience, to price a Treasury-bill (T-bill) faced by a possible interest rate increase. In the second model, we simulate our algorithm to illustrate how a quantum computer can determine financial risk for a two-asset portfolio made up of government debt with different maturity dates. Both models confirm the improved convergence rate over Monte Carlo methods. Using simulations, we also evaluate the impact of cross-talk and energy relaxation errors.},

abstract = "In this paper we consider the problem of finding the efficient frontier associated with the standard mean–variance portfolio optimisation model. We extend the standard model to include cardinality constraints that limit a portfolio to have a specified number of assets, and to impose limits on the proportion of the portfolio held in a given asset (if any of the asset is held). We illustrate the differences that arise in the shape of this efficient frontier when such constraints are present. We present three heuristic algorithms based upon genetic algorithms, tabu search and simulated annealing for finding the cardinality constrained efficient frontier. Computational results are presented for five data sets involving up to 225 assets.
Scope and purpose
The standard Markowitz mean–variance approach to portfolio selection involves tracing out an efficient frontier, a continuous curve illustrating the tradeoff between return and risk (variance). This frontier can be easily found via quadratic programming. This approach is well-known and widely applied. However, for practical purposes, it may be desirable to limit the number of assets in a portfolio, as well as imposing limits on the proportion of the portfolio devoted to any particular asset. If such constraints exist, the problem of finding the efficient frontier becomes much harder. This paper illustrates how, in the presence of such constraints, the efficient frontier becomes discontinuous. Three heuristic techniques are applied to the problem of finding this efficient frontier and computational results presented for a number of data sets which are made publicly available."

This movement can be estimated by the difference between the magnitudes of two stock prices in distinct periods and this difference can be used to calculate the volatility of the markets. The volatility characterizes the sensitivity of a market change in the world economy. Traditionally, the probability density function (pdf) of the movement of the markets is analyzed by using power laws. The contributions of this work is two-fold: (i) an analysis of the volatility dynamic of the world market indexes is performed by using a two-year window time data. In this case, the experiments show that the pdf of the volatility is better fitted by exponential function than power laws, in all range of pdf; (ii) after that, we investigate a relationship between the volatility of the markets and the coefficient of the exponential function based on the Maxwell–Boltzmann ideal gas theory. The results show an inverse relationship between the volatility and the coefficient of the exponential function. This information can be used, for example, to predict the future behavior of the markets or to cluster the markets in order to analyze economic patterns."

Finally, we consider quantum amplitude estimation, and how it can result in a quantum speed-up for Monte Carlo sampling.

abstract="We investigate a hybrid quantum-classical solution method to the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems. Starting from real financial data statistics and following the principles of the Modern Portfolio Theory, we generate parametrized samples of portfolio optimization problems that can be related to quadratic binary optimization forms programmable in the analog D-Wave Quantum Annealer 2000QTM. The instances are also solvable by an industry-established genetic algorithm approach, which we use as a classical benchmark. We investigate several options to run the quantum computation optimally, ultimately discovering that the best results in terms of expected time-to-solution as a function of number of variables for the hardest instances set are obtained by seeding the quantum annealer with a solution candidate found by a greedy local search and then performing a reverse annealing protocol. The optimized reverse annealing protocol is found to be more than 100 times faster than the corresponding forward quantum annealing on average.",

It discusses the limitations of the environment with respect to financial modeling considerations. This will be accomplished by presenting the formulation of financial portfolio optimization in the context of the hardware paradigm. The chapter presents and discusses quantum computing paradigm. The research question covers three areas that are reflected in the literature: classical mean-variance portfolio theory; general operations research theory with specific consideration given to combinatorial optimization topics; and the hardware realization of adiabatic quantum computation. The chapter reviews a survey of background literature, the models used and experimental methodology. It relates the portfolio optimization representation to the graph theoretic domain and into the underlying Ising problem domain of the target hardware. Finally, it provides results to the underlying domain, along with limitations and future areas for investigation.}

@article{HibatAllah2022,
	abstract = {Many important challenges in science and technology can be cast as optimization problems. When viewed in a statistical physics framework, these can be tackled by simulated annealing, where a gradual cooling procedure helps search for ground-state solutions of a target Hamiltonian. Although powerful, simulated annealing is known to have prohibitively slow sampling dynamics when the optimization landscape is rough or glassy. Here we show that, by generalizing the target distribution with a parameterized model, an analogous annealing framework based on the variational principle can be used to search for ground-state solutions. Modern autoregressive models such as recurrent neural networks provide ideal parameterizations because they can be sampled exactly without slow dynamics, even when the model encodes a rough landscape. We implement this procedure in the classical and quantum settings on several prototypical spin glass Hamiltonians and find that, on average, it substantially outperforms traditional simulated annealing in the asymptotic limit, illustrating the potential power of this yet unexplored route to optimization.},

First, we use an exact local expansion of the entropy function to prove almost sure consistency and central limit theorems for three of the most commonly used discretized information estimators. The setup is related to Grenander's method of sieves and places no assumptions on the underlying probability measure generating the data. Second, we prove a converse to these consistency theorems, demonstrating that a misapplication of the most common estimation techniques leads to an arbitrarily poor estimate of the true information, even given unlimited data. This "inconsistency" theorem leads to an analytical approximation of the bias, valid in surprisingly small sample regimes and more accurate than the usual 1/N formula of Miller and Madow over a large region of parameter space. The two most practical implications of these results are negative: (1) information estimates in a certain data regime are likely contaminated by bias, even if "bias-corrected" estimators are used, and (2) confidence intervals calculated by standard techniques drastically underestimate the error of the most common estimation methods.Finally, we note a very useful connection between the bias of entropy estimators and a certain polynomial approximation problem. By casting bias calculation problems in this approximation theory framework, we obtain the best possible generalization of known asymptotic bias results. More interesting, this framework leads to an estimator with some nice properties: the estimator comes equipped with rigorous bounds on the maximum error over all possible underlying probability distributions, and this maximum error turns out to be surprisingly small. We demonstrate the application of this new estimator on both real and simulated data.},

    abstract = { In applications ranging from DNA sequencing through archeological dating to sparse matrix reordering, a recurrent problem is the sequencing of elements in such a way that highly correlated pairs of elements are near each other. That is, given a correlation function f reflecting the desire for each pair of elements to be near each other, find all permutations \$\pi\$ with the property that if \$\pi(i) < \pi(j) < \pi(k)\$ then \$f(i,j) \ge f(i,k)\$ and \$f(j,k) \ge f(i,k)\$. This seriationproblem is a generalization of the well-studied consecutive ones problem. We present a spectral algorithm for this problem that has a number of interesting features. Whereas most previous applications of spectral techniques provide only bounds or heuristics, our result is an algorithm that correctly solves a nontrivial combinatorial problem. In addition, spectral methods are being successfully applied as heuristics to a variety of sequencing problems, and our result helps explain and justify these applications. }

abstract = {In this paper we explore how to embed symbolic relational graphs with unweighted edges in a pattern-space. We adopt a graph-spectral approach. We use the leading eigenvectors of the graph adjacency matrix to define eigenmodes of the adjacency matrix. For each eigenmode, we compute vectors of spectral properties. These include the eigenmode perimeter, eigenmode volume, Cheeger number, inter-mode adjacency matrices and intermode edge-distance. We embed these vectors in a pattern-space using two contrasting approaches. The first of these involves performing principal or independent components analysis on the covariance matrix for the spectral pattern vectors. The second approach involves performing multidimensional scaling on the L2 norm for pairs of pattern vectors. We illustrate the utility of the embedding methods on neighbourhood graphs representing the arrangement of corner features in 2D images of 3D polyhedral objects. Two problems are investigated. The first of these is the clustering of graphs representing distinct objects viewed from different directions. The second is the identification of characteristic views of single objects. These two studies reveal that both embedding methods result in well-structured view spaces for graph-data extracted from 2D views of 3D objects.}

@article{Cerezo2021_vqareview,
	abstract = {Applications such as simulating complicated quantum systems or solving large-scale linear algebra problems are very challenging for classical computers, owing to the extremely high computational cost. Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.},

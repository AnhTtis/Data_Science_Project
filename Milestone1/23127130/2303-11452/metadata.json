    "abstract": "The $μ$-conductance measure proposed by Lovasz and Simonovits is a size-specific conductance score that identifies the set with smallest conductance while disregarding those sets with volume smaller than a $μ$ fraction of the whole graph. Using $μ$-conductance enables us to study in new ways. In this manuscript we propose a modified spectral cut that is a natural relaxation of the integer program of $μ$-conductance and show the optimum of this program has a two-sided Cheeger inequality with $μ$-conductance.",

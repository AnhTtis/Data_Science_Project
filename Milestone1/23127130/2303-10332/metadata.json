    "abstract": "In this work, the mass spectrum of the first radial excitation axial vector meson nonet is considered in the framework of the nonrelativistic constituent quark model and Regge phenomenology. After that, we investigate the strong decay characteristics of these states within the $^{3}P_{0}$ model. The results are compared to values from other phenomenological models, and they may be beneficial in the prospective search for $2^{3}P_{1}$ meson nonets.",

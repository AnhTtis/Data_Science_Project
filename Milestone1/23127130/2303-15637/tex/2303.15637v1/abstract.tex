We present a local minimax lower bound on the excess cost of designing a linear-quadratic controller from offline data. The bound is valid for any offline exploration policy that consists of a stabilizing controller and an energy bounded exploratory input. The derivation leverages a relaxation of the minimax estimation problem to Bayesian estimation, and an application of Van Trees' inequality.  We show that the bound aligns with system-theoretic intuition. In particular, we demonstrate that the lower bound increases when the optimal control objective value increases. We also show that the lower bound increases when the system is poorly excitable, as characterized by the spectrum of the controllability gramian of the system mapping the noise to the state and the $\calH_\infty$ norm of the system mapping the input to the state. We further show that for some classes of systems, the lower bound may be exponential in the state dimension, demonstrating exponential sample complexity for learning the linear-quadratic regulator offline.

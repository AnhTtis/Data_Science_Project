\section{Conclusion}
\label{s: conclusion}

We presented lower bounds for offline linear-quadratic control problems. The focus was to understand the fundamental limitations of learning controllers from offline data in terms of system-theoretic properties. 
 Several interesting consequences arose, such as the fact that our lower bound achieves the optimal dimensional dependence $\dx \du$ for underactuated systems. We also showed that there exist classes of systems where the sample complexity is exponential with the system dimension, $\dx$. We finally demonstrated that the lower bound scales in a natural way with familiar system-theoretic constants including the eigenvalues of the Riccati solution. An avenue for future work is extension of the lower bounds to the partially observed setting.  %to formulate the exploration assumptions to capture the problem of transfer learning by enforcing that the exploration policy behaves near optimally in some objective.

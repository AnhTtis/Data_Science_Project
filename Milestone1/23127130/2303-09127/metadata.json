    "abstract": "The onset of light-induced bioconvection via linear stability theory is investigated qualitatively for a suspension of phototactic algae. The forward scattering algal suspension is uniformly illuminated by both diffuse and oblique collimated flux. An unstable mode of disturbance at bioconvective instability transits from the stationary (overstable) to overstable (stationary) state at the variation in forward scattering coefficient for fixed parameters. Suspension becomes more stable as forward scattering coefficient increases.",

    "abstract": "We explore flavor changing neutral currents which originate from the flavor violating Two Higgs Doublet Model for both LHC and future lepton-hadron colliders. Processes of Flavor Changing Neutral Currents are present at tree level if dynamics beyond the Standard Model is included. To examine the scenarios that could exhibit such events, we perform a search in the parameter space to determine the possible same sign top pair production at the $pp$ LHC and also single top quark production in $e p$ Deep Inelastic Scattering at a future LHeC, for energies given by current and future colliders. We show the order of magnitude for the model parameter $\\vert\\tildeχ_{ij}^{f}\\vert$ that would allow for the observation of flavor violation through the scalar sector. In addition we explore the order of magnitude of possible single top production via $μp$, at the proposed muon-proton colliders. We found scattering values for these exotic processes of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})pb$.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in superconductivity research is to understand the modification of superconductivity from reduced length scales. Despite decades of research in spatially confined superconducting systems, a systematic investigation of the lateral quantum confinement effect on high-temperature superconductors is still rare and desired. Here, we report the scanning tunneling spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference measurements on laterally confined FeSe monolayers on SrTiO3 substrates, which are formed by epitaxially growing FeSe films with the coverage less than one unit cell. Comparing to the uniform regions of FeSe monolayers, the peninsulas regions at the monolayer boundary show a reduced Fermi energy and undiminished superconductivity, leading to a crossover from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state to Bose-Einstein condensate state. In isolated FeSe monolayer islands, superconductivity is illustrated to exist in samples of smaller volume in contrast to conventional superconductors, while the validity of Anderson criterion is still verified. Our work reveals the lateral quantum confinement effect on superconductors at the two-dimensional limit, and may shed light on the understanding of unconventional superconductivity in low-dimensional systems.",

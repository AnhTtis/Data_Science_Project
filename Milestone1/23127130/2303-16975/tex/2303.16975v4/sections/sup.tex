\noindent \textbf{This appendix is organized as follows:} \\
\noindent 7. \emph{EgoTV dataset}: Details on generation process, additional statistics. 8. \emph{CrossTask Verification (CTV) dataset}: Details on generation process and evaluation. \emph{NSG}: Semantic parsing approaches, additional analysis and ablations, performance on CTV. \emph{Baselines}: Details on VLM and Oracle baselines.

%\noindent 11. EgoTV dataset tables and charts 

% We will release the code and dataset upon acceptance. A few sample videos \& annotations from the \etv dataset are provided in {\color{blue}\textbf{EgoTV data/}} in the supplementary material. We also include demo videos showing how NSG works on the dataset in the folder {\color{blue}\textbf{DemoVideo/}}. Lastly, the code for generating the dataset as well as for NSG and the baselines is in the folder {\color{blue}\textbf{Code/}}.

abstract = {The application of a newly proposed generalised neo-Hookean strain energy function to the inflation of incompressible rubber-like spherical and cylindrical shells is demonstrated in this paper. The pressure (P) – inflation ($\lambda$ or v) relationships are derived and presented for four shells: thin- and thick-walled spherical balloons, and thin- and thick-walled cylindrical tubes. Characteristics of the inflation curves predicted by the model for the four considered shells are analysed and the critical values of the model parameters for exhibiting the limit-point instability are established. The application of the model to extant experimental datasets procured from studies across 19th to 21st century will be demonstrated, showing favourable agreement between the model and the experimental data. The capability of the model to capture the two characteristic instability phenomena in the inflation of rubber-like materials, namely the limit-point and inflation-jump instabilities, will be made evident from both the theoretical analysis and curve-fitting approaches presented in this study. A comparison with the predictions of the Gent model for the considered data is also demonstrated and is shown that our presented model provides improved fits. Given the simplicity of the model, its ability to fit a wide range of experimental data and capture both limit-point and inflation-jump instabilities, we propose the application of our model to the inflation of rubber-like materials.},

@article{Klotz2007,
abstract = {The end-diastolic pressure-volume relation (EDPVR) is an important descriptor of passive cardiac pump properties. However, clinical utility has been limited by the need for measurement of pressures and volumes over relatively large ranges. In this protocol, we describe an algorithm to estimate the entire EDPVR in humans from a single measured pressure-volume (P-V) point. This algorithm was developed from observations made from accurately measured EDPVRs of human hearts, which indicated that when normalized by appropriate left ventricular volume scaling (to arrive at volume-normalized EDPVRs, EDPVRn) EDPVRns were nearly identical in all patients. In this protocol, we demonstrate how to use EDPVRns to predict a second P-V point on the EDPVR, in which case the entire EDPVR can then be predicted. With recent advances for accurate noninvasive measurement of end-diastolic pressure and volumes, this protocol permits the assessment of passive properties in a broader range of research and clinical settings.},

@article{Burkhoff1987,
abstract = {The shape of the end-systolic tension-length relationship (ESTLR) changes when contractile state is changed, whereas the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) remains linear despite changes in contractility. To investigate this disparity, the ESPVR was determined with contractility altered extensively by dobutamine, BAY K 8644, nifedipine, lowering coronary blood flow, and the introduction of extrasystolic and postextrasystolic stimulations. The ESPVRs were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis to the parabolic equation P(es) = aV(es)2 + bV(es) + c, where P(es) is end-systolic pressure, V(es) is end-systolic volume, and a, b, and c are parameters. There was a negative, statistically significant correlation between a, which serves as a shape index of the ESPVR, and E'(max), the slope of the ESPVR in a low volume range. When E'(max) was large a was negative, indicating increasing concavity of the ESPVR to the volume axis at high contractility. When E'(max) was small a was positive, indicating convexity of the ESPVRs to the volume axis at low contractility. Within the average range of E'(max) between 3.4 and 7.8 mmHg/ml, however, the parabolic fit to the data was not statistically better than a linear fit over the range of volumes testable in the isolated heart. We conclude that the shape of the ESPVR measured in the isolated canine heart changes with contractile state. In accordance with previous interpretations of shape changes in the muscle ESTLR, these results are consistent with the existence of length-dependent activation of cardiac muscle in the intact heart.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding the underlying feedback mechanisms of fluid/solid coupling and the role it plays in heart function is crucial for characterizing normal heart function and its behavior in disease. To improve this understanding, an anatomically accurate computational model of fluid–solid mechanics in the left ventricle is presented which assesses both the passive diastolic and active systolic phases of the heart. Integrating multiple data which characterize the hemodynamical and tissue mechanical properties of the heart, a numerical approach was applied which allows non-conformity in an optimal finite element scheme (J. Comp. Phys., submitted; Fluid–solid coupling for the simulation of left ventricular mechanics, University of Oxford, 2009). This approach is applied to look specifically at left ventricular fluid/solid coupling, allowing quantitative assessment of blood flow through the left ventricle, pressure distributions, activation and the loss of mechanical energy due to viscous dissipation.

@article{Dokos2002,
abstract = {We examined the shear properties of passive ventricular myocardium in six pig hearts. Samples (3 x 3 x 3 mm) were cut from adjacent regions of the lateral left ventricular midwall, with sides aligned with the principal material axes. Four cycles of sinusoidal simple shear (maximum shear displacements of 0.1-0.5) were applied separately to each specimen in two orthogonal directions. Resulting forces along the three axes were measured. Three specimens from each heart were tested in different orientations to cover all six modes of simple shear deformation. Passive myocardium has nonlinear viscoelastic shear properties with reproducible, directionally dependent softening as strain is increased. Shear properties were clearly anisotropic with respect to the three principal material directions: passive ventricular myocardium is least resistant to simple shear displacements imposed in the plane of the myocardial layers and most resistant to shear deformations that produce extension of the myocyte axis. Comparison of results for the six different shear modes suggests that simple shear deformation is resisted by elastic elements aligned with the microstructural axes of the tissue.},

abstract = {A set of constitutive equations is proposed to describe the mechanics of contraction of skeletal and heart muscle. Fiber tension is assumed to depend on the degree of chemical activation, the stretch ratio, and the rate of stretching of the fibers. The time rate of change of activation is governed by a differential equation. The proposed constitutive equations are used to model the time courses of isotonic and isometric twitches during contraction and relaxation phases of the muscle response to stimulation. Various contractility indices of the left ventricle are considered next by using the proposed constitutive equations. The present analysis introduces a new interpretation of the index of contractility (dP/dt)/P used in cardiac literature. It is shown that this index may not be related at all to the maximum speed of shortening and that it may be dependent on both preload and afterload. The development of pressure during isovolumetric contraction of the left ventricle is shown to be governed by a differential equation describing the time rate of change of tension during isometric contraction of myocardium fibers. {\textcopyright} 1985, The Biophysical Society.

@article{Chabiniok2016,
abstract = {With heart and cardiovascular diseases continually challenging healthcare systems worldwide, translating basic research on cardiac (patho)physiology into clinical care is essential. Exacerbating this already extensive challenge is the complexity of the heart, relying on its hierarchical structure and function to maintain cardiovascular flow. Computational modelling has been proposed and actively pursued as a tool for accelerating research and translation. Allowing exploration of the relationships between physics, multiscale mechanisms and function, computational modelling provides a platform for improving our understanding of the heart. Further integration of experimental and clinical data through data assimilation and parameter estimation techniques is bringing computational models closer to use in routine clinical practice. This article reviews developments in computational cardiac modelling and how their integration with medical imaging data is providing new pathways for translational cardiac modelling.},

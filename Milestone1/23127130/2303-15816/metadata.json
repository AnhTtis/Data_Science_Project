    "abstract": "Left ventricular (LV) stiffness and contractility, characterized by the end-diastolic and end-systolic pressure-volume relationships (EDPVR & ESPVR), are two important indicators of the performance of the human heart. Although much research has been conducted on EDPVR and ESPVR, no model with physically interpretable parameters combining both relationships has been presented, thereby impairing the understanding of cardiac physiology and pathology. Here, we present a model that evaluates both EDPVR and ESPVR with physical interpretations of the parameters in a unified framework. Our physics-based model fits the available experimental data and in silico results very well and outperforms existing models. With prescribed parameters, the new model is used to predict the pressure-volume relationships of the left ventricle. Our model provides a deeper understanding of cardiac mechanics and thus will have applications in cardiac research and clinical medicine.",

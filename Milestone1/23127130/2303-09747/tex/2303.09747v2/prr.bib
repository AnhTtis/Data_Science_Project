abstract={Nonreciprocal transport refers to charge transfer processes that are sensitive to the bias polarity. Until recently, nonreciprocal transport was studied only in dissipative systems, where the nonreciprocal quantity is the resistance. Recent experiments have, however, demonstrated nonreciprocal supercurrent leading to the observation of a supercurrent diode effect in Rashba superconductors. Here we report on a supercurrent diode effect in NbSe2 constrictions obtained by patterning NbSe2 flakes with both even and odd layer number. The observed rectification is a consequence of the valley-Zeeman spin-orbit interaction. We demonstrate a rectification efficiency as large as 60{\%}, considerably larger than the efficiency of devices based on Rashba superconductors. In agreement with recent theory for superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, we show that the effect is driven by the out-of-plane component of the magnetic field. Remarkably, we find that the effect becomes field-asymmetric in the presence of an additional in-plane field component transverse to the current direction. Supercurrent diodes offer a further degree of freedom in designing superconducting quantum electronics with the high degree of integrability offered by van der Waals materials.},

abstract={The superconducting analogue to the semiconducting diode, the Josephson diode, has long been sought with multiple avenues to realization being proposed by theorists1--3. Showing magnetic-field-free, single-directional superconductivity with Josephson coupling, it would serve as the building block for next-generation superconducting circuit technology. Here we realized the Josephson diode by fabricating an inversion symmetry breaking van der Waals heterostructure of NbSe2/Nb3Br8/NbSe2. We demonstrate that even without a magnetic field, the junction can be superconducting with a positive current while being resistive with a negative current. The $\Delta$Ic behaviour (the difference between positive and negative critical currents) with magnetic field is symmetric and Josephson coupling is proved through the Fraunhofer pattern. Also, stable half-wave rectification of a square-wave excitation was achieved with a very low switching current density, high rectification ratio and high robustness. This non-reciprocal behaviour strongly violates the known Josephson relations and opens the door to discover new mechanisms and physical phenomena through integration of quantum materials with Josephson junctions, and provides new avenues for superconducting quantum devices.},

abstract={Nonlinear optical and electrical effects associated with a lack of spatial inversion symmetry allow direction-selective propagation and transport of quantum particles, such as photons1 and electrons2--9. The most common example of such nonreciprocal phenomena is a semiconductor diode with a p--n junction, with a low resistance in one direction and a high resistance in the other. Although the diode effect forms the basis of numerous electronic components, such as rectifiers, alternating--direct-current converters and photodetectors, it introduces an inevitable energy loss due to the finite resistance. Therefore, a worthwhile goal is to realize a superconducting diode that has zero resistance in only one direction. Here we demonstrate a magnetically controllable superconducting diode in an artificial superlattice [Nb/V/Ta]n without a centre of inversion. The nonreciprocal resistance versus current curve at the superconducting-to-normal transition was clearly observed by a direct-current measurement, and the difference of the critical current is considered to be related to the magnetochiral anisotropy caused by breaking of the spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetries10--13. Owing to the nonreciprocal critical current, the [Nb/V/Ta]n superlattice exhibits zero resistance in only one direction. This superconducting diode effect enables phase-coherent and direction-selective charge transport, paving the way for the construction of non-dissipative electronic circuits.},

abstract={The electrical Hall effect is the production, upon the application of an electric field, of a transverse voltage under an out-of-plane magnetic field. Studies of the Hall effect have led to important breakthroughs, including the discoveries of Berry curvature and topological Chern invariants1,2. The internal magnetization of magnets means that the electrical Hall effect can occur in the absence of an external magnetic field2; this `anomalous' Hall effect is important for the study of quantum magnets2--7. The electrical Hall effect has rarely been studied in non-magnetic materials without external magnetic fields, owing to the constraint of time-reversal symmetry. However, only in the linear response regime---when the Hall voltage is linearly proportional to the external electric field---does the Hall effect identically vanish as a result of time-reversal symmetry; the Hall effect in the nonlinear response regime is not subject to such symmetry constraints8--10. Here we report observations of the nonlinear Hall effect10 in electrical transport in bilayers of the non-magnetic quantum material WTe2 under time-reversal-symmetric conditions. We show that an electric current in bilayer WTe2 leads to a nonlinear Hall voltage in the absence of a magnetic field. The properties of this nonlinear Hall effect are distinct from those of the anomalous Hall effect in metals: the nonlinear Hall effect results in a quadratic, rather than linear, current--voltage characteristic and, in contrast to the anomalous Hall effect, the nonlinear Hall effect results in a much larger transverse than longitudinal voltage response, leading to a nonlinear Hall angle (the angle between the total voltage response and the applied electric field) of nearly 90 degrees. We further show that the nonlinear Hall effect provides a direct measure of the dipole moment10 of the Berry curvature, which arises from layer-polarized Dirac fermions in bilayer WTe2. Our results demonstrate a new type of Hall effect and provide a way of detecting Berry curvature in non-magnetic quantum materials.},

We focus on recent scientific advances that have resulted in large enhancements of the in-field critical current in state-of-the-art second generation (2G) YBCO coated conductors and on the prospect of an isotropic, high-critical current superconductor in the iron-based superconductors. Lastly, we discuss an emerging new paradigm of critical current by design---a drive to achieve a quantitative correlation between the observed critical current density and mesoscale mixed pinning landscapes by using realistic input parameters in an innovative and powerful large-scale time dependent Ginzburg--Landau approach to simulating vortex dynamics.},

abstract={In a hybrid system of topological insulator (TI)/superconductor (SC), the proximity-induced topological superconductivity is expected to appear at the interface. Here we propose and demonstrate that a TI/SC hybrid Bi2Te3/PdTe2 heterostructure serves as a platform for exploring topological superconductivity with various features: all made of tellurium compounds, epitaxial growth, and a small charge transfer interface. In the Bi2Te3/PdTe2 heterostructure films, we observe large nonreciprocal charge transport near the superconducting transition temperature under a transverse in-plane magnetic field. The observation indicates the interplay between the topological surface state and superconductivity, suggesting that the Bi2Te3/PdTe2 heterostructure is a candidate for a topological superconductor. Also observed is an unexpected sign reversal of the nonreciprocal coefficient when the in-plane magnetic field is slightly tilted toward the out-of-plane direction. The analysis reveals that the sign reversal occurs with the change of dominant vortex type, that is, the change from spontaneous vortices to external-field induced ones.},

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally the generation of rectified mean vortex displacement resulting from a controlled difference between the surface barriers at the opposite borders of a superconducting strip. Our investigation focuses on Al superconducting strips where, in one of the two sample borders, a saw tooth-like array of micro-indentations has been imprinted. The origin of the vortex ratchet effect is based on the fact that (i) the onset of vortex motion is mainly governed by the entrance/nucleation of vortices and (ii) the current lines bunching produced by the indentations facilitates the entrance/nucleation of vortices. Only for one current direction the indentations are positioned at the side of vortex entry and the onset of the resistive regime is lowered compared to the opposite current direction. This investigation points to the relevance of ubiquitous border effects typically neglected when interpreting vortex ratchet measurements on samples with arrays of local asymmetric pinning sites.}

title = {Nernst effect in metals and superconductors: a review of concepts and experiments},
journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {The Nernst effect is the transverse electric field produced by a longitudinal thermal gradient in the presence of a magnetic field. At the beginning of this century, Nernst experiments on cuprates were analyzed assuming that: (i) the contribution of quasi-particles to the Nernst signal is negligible; and (ii) Gaussian superconducting fluctuations cannot produce a Nernst signal well above the critical temperature. Both these assumptions were contradicted by subsequent experiments. This paper reviews experiments documenting multiple sources of a Nernst signal, which, according to the Bridgman relation, measures the flow of transverse entropy caused by a longitudinal particle flow. Along the lines of Landauer’s approach to transport phenomena, the magnitude of the transverse magneto-thermoelectric response is linked to the quantum of thermoelectric conductance and a number of material-dependent length scales: the mean free path, the Fermi wavelength, the de Broglie thermal wavelength and the superconducting coherence length. Extremely mobile quasi-particles in dilute metals generate a widely-documented Nernst signal. Fluctuating Cooper pairs in the normal state of superconductors have been found to produce a detectable Nernst signal with an amplitude conforming to the Gaussian theory, first conceived by Ussishkin, Sondhi and Huse. In addition to these microscopic sources, mobile Abrikosov vortices, mesoscopic objects simultaneously carrying entropy and magnetic flux, can produce a sizeable Nernst response. Finally, in metals subject to a magnetic field strong enough to truncate the Fermi surface to a few Landau tubes, each exiting tube generates a peak in the Nernst response. The survey of these well-established sources of the Nernst signal is a helpful guide to identify the origin of the Nernst signal in other controversial cases.}

abstract={The recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) semimetal 1{\thinspace}T{\textasciiacute}-MoTe2 exhibits colossal magnetoresistance and superconductivity, driving a strong research interest in the material's quantum phenomena. Unlike the typical hexagonal structure found in many 2D materials, the 1{\thinspace}T{\textasciiacute}-MoTe2 lattice has strong in-plane anisotropy. A full understanding of the anisotropy is necessary for the fabrication of future devices which may exploit these quantum and topological properties, yet a detailed study of the material's anisotropy is currently lacking. While angle resolved Raman spectroscopy has been used to study anisotropic 2D materials, such as black phosphorus, there has been no in-depth study of the Raman dependence of 1{\thinspace}T{\textasciiacute}-MoTe2 on different layer numbers and excitation energies. Here, our angle resolved Raman spectroscopy shows intricate Raman anisotropy dependences of 1{\thinspace}T{\textasciiacute}-MoTe2 on polarization, flake thickness (from single layer to bulk), photon, and phonon energies. Using a Paczek approximation, the anisotropic Raman response can be captured in a classical framework. Quantum mechanically, first-principle calculations and group theory reveal that the anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions are nontrivial in the observed responses. This study is a crucial step to enable potential applications of 1{\thinspace}T{\textasciiacute}-MoTe2 in novel electronic and optoelectronic devices where the anisotropic properties might be utilized for increased functionality and performance.},

A strongly enhanced Nernst effect, 100 times larger than that in bulk NbSe2, caused by moving vortices is observed in thin film. It is found that in the low temperature, high magnetic field regime, pinning effects show little dependence on the thickness and resistivity of the superconductor films. Strong Nernst signals persist above the superconducting transition, suggesting that the Nernst effect is a sensitive probe to superconducting fluctuations. A magnetic field induced superconductor--insulator transition (SIT) is evident, which is surprising in that such a SIT usually takes place in disordered dirty superconductors, while our samples are highly crystalline and close to the clean limit. Hence, our results expand the scope of SIT into 2D crystal clean superconductors.}

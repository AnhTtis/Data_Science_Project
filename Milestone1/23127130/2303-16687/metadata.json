    "abstract": "Let $k$ and $n$ be two nonnegative integers with $n\\equiv0$ (mod 2), and let $G$ be a graph of order $n$ with a 1-factor. Then $G$ is said to be $k$-extendable for $0\\leq k\\leq\\frac{n-2}{2}$ if every matching in $G$ of size $k$ can be extended to a 1-factor. In this paper, we first establish a lower bound on the signless Laplacian spectral radius of $G$ to ensure that $G$ is $k$-extendable. Then we create some extremal graphs to claim that all the bounds derived in this article are sharp.",

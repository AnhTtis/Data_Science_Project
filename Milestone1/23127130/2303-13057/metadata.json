    "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is a task that predicts the perceptual quality of an image without its reference. Research on BIQA attracts growing attention due to the increasing amount of user-generated images and emerging mobile applications where reference images are unavailable. The problem is challenging due to the wide range of content and mixed distortion types. Many existing BIQA methods use deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve high performance. However, their large model sizes hinder their applicability to edge or mobile devices. To meet the need, a novel BIQA method with a small model, low computational complexity, and high performance is proposed and named \"GreenBIQA\" in this work. GreenBIQA includes five steps: 1) image cropping, 2) unsupervised representation generation, 3) supervised feature selection, 4) distortion-specific prediction, and 5) regression and decision ensemble. Experimental results show that the performance of GreenBIQA is comparable with that of state-of-the-art deep-learning (DL) solutions while demanding a much smaller model size and significantly lower computational complexity.",

We present \modelname, a simple and unified tracking framework designed to solve the problem of 2D and 3D MOT. \modelname incorporates object detection, motion prediction, and a detection-driven hierarchical data association, making it a comprehensive solution to MOT. The hierarchical data association strategy leverages detection scores as a powerful prior to identify the correct objects among low-score detections, reducing the issue of missing detections and fragmented trajectories. Additionally, our integrated motion prediction strategy for 3D MOT effectively addresses the problems of abrupt motion and object lost.
\modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D and 3D MOT benchmarks. Furthermore, it possesses strong generalization capabilities and can be easily combined with different 2D and 3D detectors without any learnable parameters. 
We believe this simple and unified tracking framework will be useful in real-world applications.

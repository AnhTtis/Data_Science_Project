    "abstract": "We study distributionally robust chance constrained programs (DRCCPs) with individual chance constraints and random right-hand sides. The DRCCPs treat the risk tolerances associated with the distributionally robust chance constraints (DRCCs) as decision variables to trade off between the system cost and risk of violations by penalizing the risk tolerances in the objective function. We consider two types of Wasserstein ambiguity sets: one with finite support and one with a continuum of realizations. By exploring the hidden discrete structures, we develop mixed integer programming reformulations under the two types of ambiguity sets to determine the optimal risk tolerance for the chance constraint. Valid inequalities are derived to strengthen the formulations. We test instances with transportation problems of diverse sizes and a demand response management problem.",

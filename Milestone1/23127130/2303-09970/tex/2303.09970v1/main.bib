abstract = {Abstract Among the exceptional properties of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) is the ultraslow cooling of hot carriers. Carrier densities below the Mott density for large polarons (≤ ≈1018 cm−3) are focused on here. As in other semiconductors, a nascent hot electron distribution initially cools down via emission of longitudinal optical (LO) phonons on the 10−14–10−13 s timescale. What distinguishes LHPs from conventional semiconductors is the exceptionally efficient screening in the former. The dielectric screening in LHPs on the 10−13 s timescale results in an order-of-magnitude reduction in the Coulomb potential upon the formation of a large polaron, likely with ferroelectric-like local ordering. Further LO-phonon emission is inhibited, and this leads to partial retention of hot electron energy on the 10−12 s timescale, more so in hybrid LHPs than in their all-inorganic counterparts. Further cooling of hot polarons occurs on the 10−10 s timescale, and this can be attributed to the slow diffusion of heat out of the large polaron volume due to the low thermal conductivity of LHPs. Like other carrier properties, slow hot carrier cooling in LHPs can be intimately related to efficient screening in a soft, anharmonic, and dynamically disordered lattice.},

abstract = {Hybrid lead halide perovskites exhibit carrier properties that resemble those of pristine nonpolar semiconductors despite static and dynamic disorder, but how carriers are protected from efficient scattering with charged defects and optical phonons is unknown. Here, we reveal the carrier protection mechanism by comparing three single-crystal lead bromide perovskites: CH3NH3PbBr3, CH(NH2)2PbBr3, and CsPbBr3. We observed hot fluorescence emission from energetic carriers with ~102-picosecond lifetimes in CH3NH3PbBr3 or CH(NH2)2PbBr3, but not in CsPbBr3. The hot fluorescence is correlated with liquid-like molecular reorientational motions, suggesting that dynamic screening protects energetic carriers via solvation or large polaron formation on time scales competitive with that of ultrafast cooling. Similar protections likely exist for band-edge carriers. The long-lived energetic carriers may enable hot-carrier solar cells with efficiencies exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit.}}

abstract = {Extraction of photoexcited charge carriers transported up to 600 nanometers in CH3NH3PbI3 could boost solar cell efficiency. If charge carriers in solar cells can be harvested before they cool on their way to equilibrium, then the Shockley-Queisser limit of 33\% for solar cell efficiency can potentially be beaten. Long carrier lifetimes (∼100 ps) have been reported for hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites. Guo et al. imaged charge transport in CH3NH3PbI3 thin films with transient absorption microscopy. Hot carriers could travel up to 600 nm, which suggests that devices that harvest hot carriers may be feasible. Science, this issue p. 59 The Shockley-Queisser limit for solar cell efficiency can be overcome if hot carriers can be harvested before they thermalize. Recently, carrier cooling time up to 100 picoseconds was observed in hybrid perovskites, but it is unclear whether these long-lived hot carriers can migrate long distance for efficient collection. We report direct visualization of hot-carrier migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) thin films by ultrafast transient absorption microscopy, demonstrating three distinct transport regimes. Quasiballistic transport was observed to correlate with excess kinetic energy, resulting in up to 230 nanometers transport distance that could overcome grain boundaries. The nonequilibrium transport persisted over tens of picoseconds and ~600 nanometers before reaching the diffusive transport limit. These results suggest potential applications of hot-carrier devices based on hybrid perovskites.}}

In line with these discussions{,} we present optical properties governed by the strong electron–phonon interactions and the unusual thermal properties.

abstract = {CH3NH3SnI3 is a metal halide perovskite that shows metallic conductivity over a wide temperature range, although ab initio calculations and optical absorption indicate that its band structure is consistent with that of an intrinsic semiconductor. Hall effect measurements of as-grown crystals give a hole concentration of about 9×1017cm−3 with rather high Hall mobility of about 200cm2V−1s−1 at 250K. Artificial hole doping enhances the electrical conductivity of the crystals without influencing mobility. These observations indicate that the electronic structure in stoichiometric CH3NH3SnI3 can be described as that of an intrinsic semiconductor with a wide valence band. This situation leads to metal-like conduction with even a trace amount of spontaneous hole doping in the as-grown crystal.}

abstract = {Abstract Tin-based perovskites have long remained a side topic in current perovskite optoelectronic research. With the recent efficiency improvement in thin film solar cells and the observation of a long hot carrier cooling time in formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3), a thorough understanding of the material's photophysics becomes a pressing matter. Since pronounced background doping can easily obscure the actual material properties, it is of paramount importance to understand how different processing conditions affect the observed behavior. Using photoluminescence spectroscopy, thin films of FASnI3 fabricated through different protocols are therefore investigated. It is shown that hot carrier relaxation occurs much faster in highly p-doped films due to carrier–carrier scattering. From high quality thin films, the longitudinal optical phonon energy and the electron–phonon coupling constant are extracted, which are fundamental to understanding carrier cooling. Importantly, high quality films allow for the observation of a previously unreported state of microsecond lifetime at lower energy in FASnI3, that has important consequences for the discussion of long lived emission in the field of metal halide perovskites.},

Despite the huge potential of this class of materials{,} the use of Pb-containing systems will likely hamper the wide spread take off of perovskite solar cells. The development of lead-free hybrid perovskites represents thus an important step in the exploitation of this promising technology. Very recently{,} the use of new mixed Pb–Sn MASnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskites has been reported{,} with a considerable increase in the extension of the solar spectrum absorption with respect to lead-halide perovskites{,} shifting the absorption onset down to the near-IR. In light of the anticipated potential of Sn-based organohalide perovskites in replacing lead-based materials{,} here we apply a recently developed computational approach to the description of mixed Sn–Pb compounds showing a range of compositions comparable to experimentally characterized compounds. For the investigated series of MASnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskites we find a continuous and monotonic variation of the energy levels{,} shifting at lower potentials; and band-gaps{,} which shift towards the near-IR{,} as the Sn content in the perovskite is increased. Notably{,} while we find slightly unbalanced electron/hole transport in the pure phases{,} Pb (Sn) materials being better electron (hole) transporters{,} for intermediate compositions an almost perfectly balanced charge carrier transport can be achieved{,} in line with recent experimental observations."}

abstract  ="The family of organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials has generated tremendous interest in the field of photovoltaics due to their high power conversion efficiencies. There has been intensive development of cells based on the archetypal methylammonium (MA) and recently introduced formamidinium (FA) materials{,} however{,} there is still considerable controversy over their fundamental electronic properties. Two of the most important parameters are the binding energy of the exciton (R*) and its reduced effective mass μ. Here we present extensive magneto optical studies of Cl assisted grown MAPbI3 as well as MAPbBr3 and the FA based materials FAPbI3 and FAPbBr3. We fit the excitonic states as a hydrogenic atom in magnetic field and the Landau levels for free carriers to give R* and μ. The values of the exciton binding energy are in the range 14–25 meV in the low temperature phase and fall considerably at higher temperatures for the tri-iodides{,} consistent with free carrier behaviour in all devices made from these materials. Both R* and μ increase approximately proportionally to the band gap{,} and the mass values{,} 0.09–0.117m0{,} are consistent with a simple k.p perturbation approach to the band structure which can be generalized to predict values for the effective mass and binding energy for other members of this perovskite family of materials."}

abstract = {A small amount of alkali metals goes a long way toward improving hybrid perovskites for hot carrier solar cells. Successful implementation of hot carrier solar cells requires preserving high carrier temperature as carriers migrate through the active layer. Here, we demonstrated that addition of alkali cations in hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites led to substantially elevated carrier temperature, reduced threshold for phonon bottleneck, and enhanced hot carrier transport. The synergetic effects from the Rb, Cs, and K cations result in ~900 K increase in the effective carrier temperature at a carrier density around 1018 cm−3 with an excitation 1.45 eV above the bandgap. In the doped thin films, the protected hot carriers migrate 100 s of nanometers longer than the undoped sample as imaged by ultrafast microscopy. We attributed these improvements to the relaxation of lattice strain and passivation of halide vacancies by alkali cations based on x-ray structural characterizations and first principles calculations.}}

  abstract = {Phonon scattering limits charge-carrier mobilities and governs emission line broadening in hybrid metal halide perovskites. Establishing how charge carriers interact with phonons in these materials is therefore essential for the development of high-efficiency perovskite photovoltaics and low-cost lasers. Here we investigate the temperature dependence of emission line broadening in the four commonly studied formamidinium and methylammonium perovskites, HC(NH2)2PbI3, HC(NH2)2PbBr3, CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3, and discover that scattering from longitudinal optical phonons via the Frohlich interaction is the dominant source of electron-phonon coupling near room temperature, with scattering off acoustic phonons negligible. We determine energies for the interacting longitudinal optical phonon modes to be 11.5 and 15.3[thinsp]meV, and Frohlich coupling constants of [sim]40 and 60[thinsp]meV for the lead iodide and bromide perovskites, respectively. Our findings correlate well with first-principles calculations based on many-body perturbation theory, which underlines the suitability of an electronic band-structure picture for describing charge carriers in hybrid perovskites.},

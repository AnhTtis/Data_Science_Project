In this paper we have presented panoptic one-click segmentation and showed that it is a suitable tool to produce pseudo-labels from minimal user input (single click per object).
Our approach is approximately an order of magnitude (12 times) faster than the traditional one-click approaches while achieving IoU values 68.1 and 68.8 on two challenging arable farmland datasets, commensurate with traditional approaches.
We have demonstrated that our method can be used to drastically reduce the labelling effort when creating novel datasets while maintaining accuracy.
To outline the practicality of our panoptic one-click segmentation approach we show its effectiveness at generating two instance-based semantic segmentation datasets.
We use only 10\% of the fully annotated data and augment the final 90\% with our generated pseudo-labels (generated from single clicks), creating a novel dataset for evaluating Mask R-CNN.
On this semi-supervised experiment we are able to improve IoU scores from 28.6 to 38 for \textit{SB20} and 31.7 to 39.6 for \textit{CN20}, exploiting our single click pseudo-labels.
Finally, we explore the potential of panoptic one-click segmentation to recover clicks that are missing during manual annotation.
We show that even when 75\% of the clicks are missing our approach is still able to achieve a recognition quality score of 78.9. 
This outlines our approach's ability to recover from missing clicks, something that traditional one-click approaches can not achieve.

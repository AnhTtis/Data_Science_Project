	\section{Conclusions}
We have extended HyperTSL with theories, resulting in HyperTSL(T), and provided the first infinite-state model checking algorithms for both TSL(T) and HyperTSL(T). As this is the first work to study (Hyper)TSL model checking, these are also the first algorithms for \emph{finite-state} model checking for (Hyper)TSL. For TSL(T), we have adapted known software model checking algorithm for LTL to the setting of TSL(T). We then used the technique of self-composition to generalize this algorithm to the alternation-free fragment of HyperTSL(T). 

We have furthermore described a sound but necessarily incomplete algorithm for finding counterexamples for $\forall^*\exists^*$-HyperTSL(T) formulas (and witnesses proving $\exists^* \forall^*$ formulas). Our algorithm makes it possible to find program executions violating properties like generalized noninterference, which is only expressible by using a combination of universal and existential quantifiers.

  Finding model checking algorithms for other fragments of HyperTSL(T), and implementing our approach, remains as future work.

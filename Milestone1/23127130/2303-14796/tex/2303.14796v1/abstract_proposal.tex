%Many important security properties like (generalized) noninterference are \emph{hyperproperties}, that is, properties relating multiple system executions.


%We extend an automata-based LTL software model checking algorithm for hyperproperties with quantifier alternations, developing a sound but incomplete algorithm for finding counterexamples disproving $\forall^*\exists^*$ hyperproperties or witnesses proving $\exists^* \forall^*$ hyperproperties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first software model checking algorithm that can handle hyperproperties with quantifier alternations without needing a provided finite-state abstraction. As our specification logic, we introduce hyper temporal stream logic modulo theories (HyperTSL(T)) which extends hyper linear temporal logic (HyperLTL) with predicates over inputs and memory cells and with update terms.


We develop model checking algorithms 
for Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) and Hyper Temporal Stream Logic (HyperTSL) modulo theories.
TSL extends Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) with memory cells, functions and predicates, making it a convenient and expressive logic to reason over software and other systems with infinite data domains.
%TSL extends Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) with predicates over inputs and memory cells, and with update terms that specify how the value of a memory cell should change.
%Similar to the extension of LTL to HyperLTL, 
HyperTSL further extends TSL to the specification of hyperproperties -- properties that relate multiple system executions.
% Unlike HyperLTL, 
As such, HyperTSL can express information flow policies like noninterference in software systems.
% , and the update terms make it even more suitable for software verification. 
We augment HyperTSL with theories, resulting in HyperTSL(T), and build on methods from LTL software verification to obtain model checking algorithms for TSL and HyperTSL(T).
This results in a sound but necessarily incomplete algorithm for specifications contained in the $\forall^*\exists^*$ fragment of HyperTSL(T).
Our approach constitutes the first software model checking algorithm for temporal hyperproperties with quantifier alternations that does not rely on a finite-state abstraction.


%Both TSL and HyperTSL were originally defined for synthesis, and this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt at (Hyper)TSL model checking. We study (Hyper)TSL model checking of infinite-state systems, also called software model checking. We first extend HyperTSL with theories, resulting in HyperTSL(T). We then adapt methods from LTL software model checking to the setting of TSL(T) -- TSL modulo theories, further extending them to alternation-free HyperTSL(T). We then provide an algorithm for finding counterexamples for $\forall^* \exists^*$-HyperTSL(T) formulas (or, dually, witnesses of $\exists^* \forall^*$ formulas).

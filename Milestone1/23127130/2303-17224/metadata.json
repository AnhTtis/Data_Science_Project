    "abstract": "Advances in satellite quantum communications aim at reshaping the global telecommunication network by increasing the security of the transferred information. Here, we study the effects of atmospheric turbulence in continuous-variable entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation in the optical regime between a ground station and a satellite. More specifically, we study the degradation of entanglement due to various error sources in the distribution, namely, diffraction, atmospheric attenuation, turbulence, and detector inefficiency, in both downlink and uplink scenarios. As the fidelity of a quantum teleportation protocol using these distributed entangled resources is not sufficient, we include an intermediate station for either state generation, or beam refocusing, in order to reduce the effects of atmospheric turbulence and diffraction, respectively. The results show the feasibility of free-space entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation in downlink paths up to the LEO region, but also in uplink paths with the help of the intermediate station. Finally, we complete the study with microwave-optical comparison in bad weather situations, and with the study of horizontal paths in ground-to-ground and inter-satellite quantum communication.",

    "abstract": "Optical waveguides, covered with thin films, which transmittance can be controlled by external action, are widely used in various applications from optical modulators to saturable absorbers. It is natural to suggest that the waveguide losses will be proportional to the covering material absorption. We demonstrate that under certain conditions this simple assumption fails. Instead, we observe the reduction of the film material absorption can lead to an increase in the waveguide propagation losses. For this, we use a side polished fiber covered with a single-walled carbon nanotube thin film whose absorption is attenuated either due to saturable absorption or electrochemical gating. For the films thicker than 50 nm, we observe saturable absorption to turn into light induced absorption with nonmonotonic dependence on the incident power. With a numerical simulation and analytical approach, we identify that this nontrivial behavior comes from mode reshaping and predict required parameters for its observation.",

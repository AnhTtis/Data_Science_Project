    "abstract": "High-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide a powerful tool to probe the early universe, but still for relatively few do we have good observations of the afterglow. We here report the optical and near-infrared observations of the afterglow of a relatively high-redshift event, GRB\\,220101A, triggered on New Year's Day of 2022. With the optical spectra obtained at XL2.16/BFOSC and NOT/ALFOSC, we determine the redshift of the burst at $z= 4.615$. Based on our optical and near-infrared data, combined with the X-ray data, we perform multiband fit with the python package \\emph{afterglowpy}. A jet-break at $\\sim$ 0.7 day post-burst is found to constrain the opening angle of the jet as $\\sim$ 3.4 degree. We also determine circumburst density of $n_0 = 0.15\\ {\\rm cm}^{-3}$ as well as kinetic energy $E_{\\rm K, iso} = 3.52\\times 10^{54}$ erg. The optical afterglow is among the most luminous ever detected. We also find a ``mirror'' feature in the lightcurve during the prompt phase of the burst from 80 s to 120 s. The physical origin of such mirror feature is unclear.",

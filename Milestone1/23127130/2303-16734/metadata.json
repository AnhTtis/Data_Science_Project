    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (MmWave) has been regarded as a promising technology to support high-capacity communications in 5G era. However, its high-layer performance such as latency and packet drop rate in the long term highly depends on resource allocation because mmWave channel suffers significant fluctuation with rotating users due to mmWave sparse channel property and limited field-of-view (FoV) of antenna arrays. In this paper, downlink transmission scheduling considering rotation of user equipments (UE) and limited antenna FoV in an mmWave system is optimized via a novel approximate Markov decision process (MDP) method. Specifically, we consider the joint downlink UE selection and power allocation in a number of frames where future orientations of rotating UEs can be predicted via embedded motion sensors. The problem is formulated as a finite-horizon MDP with non-stationary state transition probabilities. A novel low-complexity solution framework is proposed via one iteration step over a base policy whose average future cost can be predicted with analytical expressions. It is demonstrated by simulations that compared with existing benchmarks, the proposed scheme can schedule the downlink transmission and suppress the packet drop rate efficiently in non-stationary mmWave links.",

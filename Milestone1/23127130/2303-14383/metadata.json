    "abstract": "In this article, we explicitly construct a canonical basis for the space of certain weakly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms for $Γ_0(T)$ (resp., for $Γ_0^+(T)$) and compute the generating function satisfied by the basis elements. We also give an explicit expression for the action of the $Θ$-operator, which depends on the divisor of meromorphic Drinfeld modular forms.",

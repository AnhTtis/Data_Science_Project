    "abstract": "Let $A_t$ be a rotationally symmetric stable process, $0<α\\leq 2$, on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and $D\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded domain. This paper presents a proof, based on the classical Brascamp-Lieb-Luttinger inequalities for multiple integrals, that the distribution of the first exit time of $A_t$ from $D$ increases under Steiner symmetrization. Further, it is shown that when a sequence of domains $\\{D_m\\}$ satisfying the $\\varepsilon$-cone condition converges to a domain $D'$ with respect to the Hausdorff metric, the distributions of exit times for Brownian motion from $D_m$ converge to the distribution of the exit time of Brownian motion from $D'$. These results are applied to distributions of the first exit time from triangles and quadrilaterals in the plane to show that they are maximized by the respective first exit time distributions for the equilateral triangle and square by extending a classical result of Pólya and Szegö.",

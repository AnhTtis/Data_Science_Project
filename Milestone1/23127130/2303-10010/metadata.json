    "abstract": "Astronomy and astrophysics are regarded as highly motivating topics for students in primary and secondary schools, and they have been a recurrent and effective resource to inspire passion about science. In fact, during the last years we have witnessed a boost of facilities providing small robotic telescopes for teachers and students to remotely undertake their own observing projects. A step forward is presented here, where we describe the experience of secondary school students attending professional observations of Venus at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) and, in a second observing run, conducting the observations by themselves. In addition to quickly mastering the basic operation of the control software for the SpeX instrument, the students successfully performed different types of data acquisition, including drift scan imaging.",

    \item line 739 in the paper: Our method is trained us-
ing REAL275 with only 4.3k \textbf{real} images \textbf{of 18} objects while
achieving real-time performance.  
    \item line 662 (Figure 6) in the paper: The comparison of noise resistance between GPV-Pose and the proposed HS-Pose under different noise levels \textbf{(0.0\% to 40.0\% outliers)}.

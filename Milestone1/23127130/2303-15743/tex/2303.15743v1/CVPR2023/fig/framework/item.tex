\caption{\footnotesize \textbf{Overview of the proposed HS-Pose.} The core unit of our framework is HS-layer, which extracts the hybrid scope features of the input data in two paths to gain scale and translation encoding and capture outlier robust geometric features. We stack HS-layers and 3D graph max pooling layers to form an HS-encoder, and then connect it to three sub-modules to form HS-Pose. The three sub-modules are used for pose regression, symmetry-aware point cloud reconstruction, and bounding box voting, respectively.}

\textbf{Illustration of the hybrid scope feature extraction of the HS-layer}.
As shown in the right figure, the proposed HS-layer possesses various advantages, including the capability of capturing both local and global geometric information, robustness to outliers, and the encoding of scale and translation information. Building upon the GPV-pose, the HS-layer is employed to develop a category-level pose estimation framework, namely \textbf{HS-Pose}. Upon receiving an input point cloud, HS-Pose outputs the estimated 6D pose and 3D size of the object, as shown in the left figure. Given the strengths of the HS-layer, HS-Pose is capable of handling complex object shapes, exhibits robustness to outliers, and achieves better performance compared with existing methods.}

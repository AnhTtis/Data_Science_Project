\caption{\footnotesize \textbf{The rotation estimation of the proposed three strategies and GPV-Pose on categories with different geometric complexity.} The figure shows the rotation estimation mAP ($5^\circ$ and $10^\circ$) on objects with different geometric complexities (\ie bottle is the simplest and the camera is the most complex one). Our method boosted the rotation estimation of the simple shape (bowl) to almost $100\%$ and increased the rotation mAP on more complex objects (mug and camera) by a large margin. 
% It demonstrated the proposed method's capability of handling complex shapes.

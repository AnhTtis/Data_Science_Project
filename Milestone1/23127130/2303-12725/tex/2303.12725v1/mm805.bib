abstract = {The training of severely disabled individuals on the use of electric power wheelchairs creates many challenges, particularly in the case of children. The adjustment of equipment and training on a per-patient basis in an environment with limited specialists and resources often leads to a reduced amount of training time per patient. Virtual reality rehabilitation has recently been proven an effective way to supplement patient rehabilitation, although some important challenges remain including high setup/equipment costs and time-consuming continual adjustments to the simulation as patients improve. We propose a design for a flexible, low-cost rehabilitation system that uses virtual reality training and games to engage patients in effective instruction on the use of powered wheelchairs. We also propose a novel framework based on Bayesian networks for self-adjusting adaptive training in virtual rehabilitation environments. Preliminary results from a user evaluation and feedback from our rehabilitation specialist collaborators support the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Feature extraction on the face plays an important role in applications of model based coding and human face recognition. Traditionally, the eyes and mouth are considered to be the most significant features contributing to different facial expressions. However, detecting and tracking the nose shape is non-trivial, and plays an equally important role as eyes and mouth for model based coding, especially for analysis and synthesis of realistic facial expressions. A feature detection method on the facial organ areas is presented. Individual templates are designed for the nostril and nose-side. First, the feature regions are limited to certain areas by using two-stage region growing methods. Second, the pre-defined templates are applied to extract the shape of the nostril and nose-side. Finally, the extracted feature shapes are exploited to guide a facial model to complete an accurate adaptation. The advantage of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by experiments on real video sequences for low bit rate video coding.},

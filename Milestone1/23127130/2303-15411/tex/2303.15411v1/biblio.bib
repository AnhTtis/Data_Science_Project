	abstract = {GJ 3470b is a warm Neptune-size planet transiting an M dwarf star. Like the handful of other small exoplanets for which transmission spectroscopy has been obtained, GJ 3470b exhibits a flat spectrum in the near- and mid-infrared. Recently, a tentative detection of Rayleigh scattering in its atmosphere has been reported. This signal manifests itself as an observed increase of the planetary radius as a function of decreasing wavelength in the visible. We set out to verify this detection and observed several transits of this planet with the LCOGT network and the Kuiper telescope in four different bands (Sloan g, Sloan i, Harris B, and Harris V). Our analysis reveals a strong Rayleigh scattering slope, thus confirming previous results. This makes GJ 3470b the smallest known exoplanet with a detection of Rayleigh scattering. We find that the most plausible scenario is a hydrogen/helium-dominated atmosphere covered by clouds which obscure absorption features in the infrared and hazes which give rise to scattering in the visible. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of exoplanet atmospheric characterization from the ground, even with meter-class telescopes.}

	abstract = {We report improved masses, radii, and densities for four planets in two bright M-dwarf systems, K2-3 and GJ3470, derived from a combination of new radial velocity and transit observations. Supplementing K2 photometry with follow-up Spitzer transit observations refined the transit ephemerides of K2-3 b, c, and d by over a factor of 10. We analyze ground-based photometry from the Evryscope and Fairborn Observatory to determine the characteristic stellar activity timescales for our Gaussian Process fit, including the stellar rotation period and activity region decay timescale. The stellar rotation signals for both stars are evident in the radial velocity data and is included in our fit using a Gaussian process trained on the photometry. We find the masses of K2-3 b, K2-3 c, and GJ3470 b to be 6.48, 2.14, and 12.58 M
‚äï, respectively. K2-3 d was not significantly detected and has a 3œÉ upper limit of 2.80 M
‚äï. These two systems are training cases for future TESS systems; due to the low planet densities (œÅ¬†<¬†3.7 g cm‚àí3) and bright host stars (K¬†<¬†9 mag), they are among the best candidates for transmission spectroscopy in order to characterize the atmospheric compositions of small planets.}

@article{Tingley2014a,
abstract = {We announce confirmation of Kepler-418b, one of two proposed planets in this system. This is the first confirmation of an exoplanet based primarily on the transit color signature technique. We used the Kepler public data archive combined with multicolor photometry from the Gran Telescopio de Canarias and radial velocity follow-up using FIES at the Nordic Optical Telescope for confirmation. We report a confident detection of a transit color signature that can only be explained by a compact occulting body, entirely ruling out a contaminating eclipsing binary, a hierarchical triple, or a grazing eclipsing binary. Those findings are corroborated by our radial velocity measurements, which put an upper limit of {\~{}}1 Mjup on the mass of Kepler-418b. We also report that the host star is significantly blended, confirming the {\~{}}10{\%} light contamination suspected from the crowding metric in the Kepler light curve measured by the Kepler team. We report detection of an unresolved light source that contributes an additional {\~{}}40{\%} to the target star, which would not have been detected without multicolor photometric analysis. The resulting planet-star radius ratio is 0.110 +/- 0.0025, more than 25{\%} more than the 0.087 measured by Kepler, leading to a radius of 1.20 +/- 0.16 Rjup instead of the 0.94 Rjup measured by the Kepler team. This is the first confirmation of an exoplanet candidate based primarily on the transit color signature, demonstrating that this technique is viable from ground for giant planets. It is particularly useful for planets with long periods such as Kepler-418b, which tend to have long transit durations. Additionally, multicolor photometric analysis of transits can reveal unknown stellar neighbors and binary companions that do not affect the classification of the transiting object but can have a very significant effect on the perceived planetary radius.},

abstract = {Aims: We present a new library of high-resolution synthetic spectra based on the stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX that can be used for a wide range of applications of spectral analysis and stellar parameter synthesis. Methods: The spherical mode of PHOENIX was used to create model atmospheres and to derive detailed synthetic stellar spectra from them. We present a new self-consistent way of describing micro-turbulence for our model atmospheres. Results: The synthetic spectra cover the wavelength range from 500 {\AA} to 5.5 $\mu$m with resolutions of R = 500 000 in the optical and near IR, R = 100 000 in the %IR and $\Delta$$\lambda$ = 0.1 {\AA} in the UV. The parameter space covers 2300 K ≤ Teff ≤ 12 000 K, 0.0 ≤ log g ≤ +6.0, - 4.0 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ +1.0, and - 0.2 ≤ [$\alpha$/Fe] ≤ +1.2. The library is a work in progress and we expect to extend it up to Teff = 25 000 K.

@article{Hayek2012,
abstract = {We compare limb darkening laws derived from 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres and 1D hydrostatic MARCS models for the host stars of the two transiting exoplanet systems HD 209458 and HD 189733. The surface brightness distribution of the stellar disks is calculated using 3D LTE spectrum formation and opacity sampling. We test our predictions using least-squares fits of model light curves to primary eclipses that were observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The limb darkening law derived from the 3D model of HD 209458 between 2900 A and 5700 A produces significantly better fits to the HST data, removing systematic residuals that were previously observed for model light curves based on 1D predictions. This difference arises mainly from the shallower mean temperature structure of the 3D model, which is a consequence of the explicit simulation of surface granulation. In the case of HD 189733, the model atmospheres produce practically equivalent limb darkening curves between 2900 A and 5700 A, partly due to obstruction by spectral lines, and the data are not sufficient to distinguish between the light curves. We also analyze HST observations between 5350 A and 10500 A for this star; the 3D model leads to a better fit compared to 1D predictions. The significant improvement of fit quality for the HD 209458 system demonstrates the higher degree of realism of 3D models and the importance of surface granulation for the formation of the atmospheric radiation field of late-type stars. This result agrees well with recent investigations of limb darkening in the solar continuum and other observational tests. The case of HD 189733 is no contradiction as the model light curves are less sensitive to the temperature stratification of the atmosphere and the observed data in the 2900 A - 5700 A region are not sufficient to distinguish more clearly between 3D and 1D limb darkening.},

abstract = {We present optical photometry of 16 transits of the super-Earth GJ 1214b, allowing us to refine the system parameters and search for additional planets via transit timing. Starspot-crossing events are detected in two light curves, and the star is found to be variable by a few percent. Hence, in our analysis, special attention is given to systematic errors that result from star spots. The planet-to-star radius ratio is 0.11610+/-0.00048, subject to a possible upward bias by a few percent due to the unknown spot coverage. Even assuming this bias to be negligible, the mean density of planet can be either 3.03+/-0.50 g cm{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} or 1.89+/-0.33 g cm{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}, depending on whether the stellar radius is estimated from evolutionary models or the light curve parameters. One possible resolution is that the orbit is eccentric (e approximately equal to 0.14), which would favor the higher density, and hence a much thinner atmosphere for the planet. The transit times were found to be periodic within about 15s, ruling out the existence of any other super-Earths with periods within a factor-of-two of the known planet.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We observed one transit and one occultation of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b simultaneously in the g'r'i'z'JHK bands using the GROND instrument on the MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope. From the transit event, we have independently derived WASP-43's system parameters with high precision, and improved the period to be 0.81347437(13) days. No significant variation in transit depths is detected, with the largest deviations coming from the i', H, and K bands. Given the observational uncertainties, the broad-band transmission spectrum can be explained by either a flat featureless straight line that indicates thick clouds, synthetic spectra with absorption signatures of atomic Na/K or molecular TiO/VO that indicate cloud-free atmosphere, or a Rayleigh scattering profile that indicates high-altitude hazes. From the occultation event, we have detected planetary dayside thermal emission in the K-band with a flux ratio of 0.197 +/- 0.042{\%}, which confirms previous detections obtained in the 2.09 micron narrow band and Ks-band. The K-band brightness temperature 1878 +108/-116 K favors an atmosphere with poor day- to night-side heat redistribution. We also have a marginal detection in the i'-band (0.037 +0.023/-0.021{\%}), which is either a false positive, a signature of non-blackbody radiation at this wavelength, or an indication of reflective hazes at high altitude.},

Combining repeated observations of periodic events, simultaneous observations with multiple telescopes, different observation techniques, and existing information from theory and prior research can help to disentangle the systematics from the planetary signals, and offers synergistic advantages over analysing observations separately. Bayesian inference provides a self-consistent statistical framework that addresses both the necessity for complex systematics models, and the need to combine prior information and heterogeneous observations. This chapter offers a brief introduction to Bayesian inference in the context of exoplanet research, with focus on time series analysis, and finishes with an overview of a set of freely available programming libraries.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of an eclipsing binary star (KIC 7025851) near KOI 565 (KIC 7025846) based on photometric observations of KOI 565 and several nearby stars acquired in two narrow bandpasses (790.2 and 794.3$\backslash$pm2.0 nm) nearly-simultaneously with the GTC/OSIRIS. We use the individual photometry in each bandpass as well as the colors of KOI 565 and other nearby stars to determine that the source of the transit signal initially detected by Kepler is not due to a super-Earth-size planet around KOI 565. Instead, we find the source to be a background eclipsing binary star located $\backslash$sim15 arcsec to the North of KOI 565. We discuss future prospects for using high-precision multi-color photometry from the GTC to determine whether additional Kepler planet candidates have a planetary nature or are instead false positives (e.g., foreground or background eclipsing binaries or hierarchical triple systems). Our approach is complementary to multi-color follow-up observations of Kepler planet candidates currently being conducted with the Spitzer space telescope in the infrared as well as to other follow-up techniques.},

abstract = {Transiting super-Earths orbiting bright stars in short orbital periods are interesting targets for the study of planetary atmospheres. While selecting super-Earths suitable for further characterization from the ground among a list of confirmed and validated exoplanets detected by K2, we found some suspicious cases that led to us re-assessing the nature of the detected transiting signal. We did a photometric analysis of the K2 light curves and centroid motions of the photometric barycenters. Our study shows that the validated planets K2-78b, K2-82b, and K2-92b are actually not planets but background eclipsing binaries. The eclipsing binaries are inside the Kepler photometric aperture, but outside the ground-based high resolution images used for validation. We advise extreme care on the validation of candidate planets discovered by space missions. It is important that all the assumptions in the validation process are carefully checked. An independent confirmation is mandatory in order to avoid wasting valuable resources on further characterization of non-existent targets.},

K2 will use an innovative way of operating the spacecraft to observe target fields along the ecliptic for the next 2-3 years. Early science commissioning observations have shown an estimated photometric precision near 400 ppm in a single 30 minute observation, and a 6-hour photometric precision of 80 ppm (both at V=12). The K2 mission offers long-term, simultaneous optical observation of thousands of objects at a precision far better than is achievable from ground-based telescopes. Ecliptic fields will be observed for approximately 75-days enabling a unique exoplanet survey which fills the gaps in duration and sensitivity between the Kepler and TESS missions, and offers pre-launch exoplanet target identification for JWST transit spectroscopy. Astrophysics observations with K2 will include studies of young open clusters, bright stars, galaxies, supernovae, and asteroseismology.},

abstract = {Of the over 400 known exoplanets, there are about 70 planets that transit their central star, a situation that permits the derivation of their basic parameters and facilitates investigations of their atmospheres. Some short-period planets, including the first terrestrial exoplanet (CoRoT-7b), have been discovered using a space mission designed to find smaller and more distant planets than can be seen from the ground. Here we report transit observations of CoRoT-9b, which orbits with a period of 95.274 days on a low eccentricity of 0.11 +/- 0.04 around a solar-like star. Its periastron distance of 0.36 astronomical units is by far the largest of all transiting planets, yielding a 'temperate' photospheric temperature estimated to be between 250 and 430 K. Unlike previously known transiting planets, the present size of CoRoT-9b should not have been affected by tidal heat dissipation processes. Indeed, the planet is found to be well described by standard evolution models with an inferred interior composition consistent with that of Jupiter and Saturn.},

From high-resolution spectroscopy of the star, we find a stellar effective temperature Teff=5541 $\backslash$pm 60 K, a metallicity [Fe/H]=-0.13 $\backslash$pm 0.06, and a surface gravity log(g)=4.59 $\backslash$pm 0.10. We combine the estimate of Teff and [Fe/H] with an estimate of the stellar density derived from the photometric light curve to deduce a stellar mass of M{\_}star = 0.936 $\backslash$pm 0.040 M{\_}Sun and a stellar radius of R{\_}star = 0.850 $\backslash$pm 0.018 R{\_}Sun. We rule out the possibility that the transits result from an astrophysical false positive by first identifying the subset of stellar blends that reproduce the precise shape of the light curve. We conclude that the planetary scenario is more than three orders of magnitude more likely than a blend. The blend scenario is independently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: we measure a transit depth with Spitzer at 4.5 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m of 547+113-110 ppm, consistent with the depth measured in the Kepler optical bandpass of 567$\backslash$pm6 ppm. We determine a physical radius of the planet Kepler-19b of R{\_}p = 2.209 $\backslash$pm 0.048 R{\_}Earth. From radial-velocity observations of the star, we find an upper limit on the planet mass of 20.3 M{\_}Earth, corresponding to a maximum density of 10.4 g cm{\^{}}-3. We report a significant sinusoidal deviation of the transit times from a predicted linear ephemeris, which we conclude is due to an additional perturbing body in the system. We cannot uniquely determine the orbital parameters of the perturber, as various dynamical mechanisms match the amplitude, period, and shape of the transit timing signal and satisfy the host star's radial velocity limits. However, the perturber in these mechanisms has period {\textless}160 days and mass {\textless}6 M{\_}Jup, confirming its planetary nature as Kepler-19c. [Abridged]},

Major sources of astrophysical false positives are planetary transits and stellar eclipses on background stars. We describe several new techniques for the identification of background transit sources that are separated from their target stars, indicating an astrophysical false positive. These techniques use only Kepler photometric data. We describe the concepts and construction of these techniques in detail as well as their performance and relative merits.},

Kepler detects many more periodic signals from instrumental effects than it does from transits, and it is likely impossible to confidently distinguish the two types of events at low signal-to-noise. As a result, the scenario that the observed signal is due to an instrumental artifact cannot be ruled out with 99{\%} confidence, and the system must still be considered a candidate planet.

abstract = {The false-positive probability (FPP) of Kepler transiting candidates is a key value for statistical studies of candidate properties. A previous investigation of the stellar population in the Kepler field has provided an estimate for the FPP of less than 5{\%} for most of the candidates. We report here the results of our radial velocity observations on a sample of 46 Kepler candidates with a transit depth greater than 0.4{\%}, orbital period less than 25 days and host star brighter than Kepler magnitude 14.7. We used the SOPHIE spectrograph mounted on the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to establish the nature of the transiting candidates. In this sample, we found five undiluted eclipsing binaries, two brown dwarfs, six diluted eclipsing binaries, and nine new transiting planets that complement the 11 already published planets. The remaining 13 candidates were not followed-up or remain unsolved due to photon noise limitation or lack of observations. From these results we computed the FPP for Kepler close-in giant candidates to be 34.8{\%} $\backslash$pm 6.5{\%}. We aimed to investigate the variation of the FPP for giant candidates with the longer orbital periods and found that it should be constant for orbital periods between 10 and 200 days. This significant disagrees with the previous estimates. We discuss the reasons for this discrepancy and the possible extension of this work toward smaller planet candidates. Finally, taking the false-positive rate into account, we refined the occurrence rate of hot jupiters from the Kepler data.},

abstract = {The Kepler Mission is uniquely suited to study the frequencies of extrasolar planets. This goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives such as eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound to them, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. We perform numerical simulations to predict the occurrence of astrophysical false positives detectable by the Mission, and quantify the fraction of them that would pass the Kepler candidate vetting procedure. By comparing their distribution with that of the Kepler Objects of Interest detected during the first six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positive rate of Kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planet size, and orbital period. We find that the global false positive rate of Kepler is 9.4 {\%}, peaking for giant planets (6-22 Earth radii) at 17.7 {\%}, reaching a low of 6.7 {\%} for small Neptunes (2-4 Earth radii), and increasing again for Earth-size planets (0.8-1.25 Earth radii) to 12.3 {\%}. Most importantly, we also quantify and characterize the distribution and rate of occurrence of planets down to Earth size with no prior assumptions on their frequency, by subtracting from the population of actual Kepler candidates our simulated population of astrophysical false positives. We find that 16.5 +/- 3.6 {\%} of main-sequence FGK stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25 Earth radii with orbital periods up to 85 days. There is no significant dependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 Earth radii with spectral type. In the process, we derive also a prescription for the signal recovery rate of Kepler that enables a good match to both the KOI size and orbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution.},

abstract = {Analytical equations are presented for the computation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in the radial velocity curves of stars hosting extrasolar planets and showing periodic transits. This is a well-known effect in the radial velocity curves of eclipsing binaries that results from the fractional visibility of the stars and the subsequent loss of symmetry for the integrated rotational contribution. In this paper, general and accurate equations are presented, allowing for the computation of the effect for spherical components. The nonorbital component of the radial velocity curve, during the transit of the planet, can thus be used to determine the rotational properties of the star, including any deviation of its rotational axis from the perpendicular to the orbital plane. For this purpose, the observational effects of stellar limb darkening, as well as the geometrical and orbital elements of the system, are taken into account. Results can be used immediately for the analysis of the spectroscopic observations during the transit of extrasolar planets and allow for the simultaneous solution of the light and radial velocity curves, therefore improving the precision of the derived elements by using two completely different sources of information in an integrated form. The effects of changes in various of the involved parameters are also discussed using the analytical properties of the equations.},

abstract = {The statistical validation of transiting exoplanets proved to be an efficient technique to secure the nature of small exoplanet signals which cannot be established by purely spectroscopic means. However, the spectroscopic diagnoses are providing us with useful constraints on the presence of blended stellar contaminants. In this paper, we present how a contaminating star affects the measurements of the various spectroscopic diagnoses as function of the param-eters of the target and contaminating stars using the model implemented into the PASTIS planet-validation software. We find particular cases for which a blend might produce a large radial velocity signal but no bisector variation. It might also produce a bisector variation anti-correlated with the radial velocity one, as in the case of stellar spots. In those cases, the full width half maximum variation provides complementary constraints. These results can be used to constrain blend scenarios for transiting planet candidates or radial velocity planets. We re-view all the spectroscopic diagnoses reported in the literature so far, especially the ones to monitor the line asymmetry. We estimate their uncertainty and compare their sensitivity to blends. Based on that, we recommend the use of BiGauss which is the most sensitive diagno-sis to monitor line-profile asymmetry. In this paper, we also investigate the sensitivity of the radial velocities to constrain blend scenarios and develop a formalism to estimate the level of dilution of a blended signal. Finally, we apply our blend model to re-analyse the spectroscopic diagnoses of HD16702, an unresolved face-on binary which exhibits bisector variations.},

abstract = {Previous measurements of heat redistribution efficiency (the ability to transport energy from a planet's highly-irradiated dayside to its eternally-dark nightside) show considerable variation between exoplanets. Theoretical models predict a correlation between heat redistribution efficiency and temperature for tidally-locked planets; however, recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WASP-43b spectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve observations of WASP-43b at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The first 3.6 micron visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking unphysical conditions in our atmospheric retrievals. The two other visits exhibit strong day-night contrasts that are consistent with the HST data. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would need to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal emission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet's cool, nearly-retrograde mid-latitude flows before dispersing across its nightside at high altitudes. Since mid-latitude flows only materialize in fast-rotating ({\$}\backslashlesssim1{\$} day) planets, this may explain an observed trend connecting measured day-night contrast with planet rotation rate that matches all current Spitzer phase curve results. Combining independent planetary emission measurements from multiple phases, we obtain a precise dayside hemisphere H2O abundance ({\$}2.5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}} - 1.1\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$} at 1{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} confidence) and, assuming chemical equilibrium and a scaled solar abundance pattern, we derive a corresponding metallicity estimate that is consistent with being solar (0.4 -- 1.7).

abstract = {Context: Transit or eclipse timing variations have proven to be a valuable tool in exoplanet research. However, no simple way to estimate the potential precision of such timing measures has been presented yet, nor are guidelines available regarding the relation between timing errors and sampling rate. Aims: A `timing error estimator' (TEE) equation is presented that requires only basic transit parameters as input. With the TEE, it is straightforward to estimate timing precisions both for actual data as well as for future instruments, such as the TESS and PLATO space missions. Methods: A derivation of the timing error based on a trapezoidal transit shape is given. We also verify the TEE on realistically modeled transits using Monte Carlo simulations and determine its validity range, exploring in particular the interplay between ingress/egress times and sampling rates. Results: The simulations show that the TEE gives timing errors very close to the correct value, as long as the temporal sampling is faster than transit ingress/egress durations and transits with very low S/N are avoided. Conclusions: The TEE is a useful tool to estimate eclipse or transit timing errors in actual and future data-sets. In combination with an equation to estimate period errors (Deeg 2015), predictions for the ephemeris precision of long-coverage observations are possible as well. The tests for the TEE's validity-range led also to implications for instrumental design: Temporal sampling has to be faster than transit in- or egress durations, or a loss in timing-precision will occur. An application to the TESS mission shows that transits close to its detection limit will have timing uncertainties that exceed 1 hour within a few months after their acquisition. Prompt follow-up observations will be needed to avoid a `loosing' of their ephemeris.},

We have developed a new method to confirm giant planets solely from the photometric light curve, and we apply this method herein to Kepler-41 to establish the validity of this technique. We generate a full phase photometric model by including the primary and secondary transits, ellipsoidal variations, Doppler beaming and reflected/emitted light from the planet. Third light contamination scenarios that can mimic a planetary transit signal are simulated by injecting a full range of dilution values into the model, and we re-fit each diluted light curve model to the light curve. The resulting constraints on the maximum occultation depth and stellar density combined with stellar evolution models rules out stellar blends and provides a measurement of the planet's mass, size, and temperature. We expect about two dozen Kepler giant planets can be confirmed via this method.},

abstract = {We present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of Kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeed represent true, physically-associated transiting planets. Binary stars provide the primary source of false positives among Kepler planet candidates, implying that false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among Kepler targets. In contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around a smaller number of Kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systems and/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star are correlated. There are more than one hundred times as many Kepler planet candidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a random distribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets. Most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the Kepler target star, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits a fainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has been estimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiple star system. We use the low overall false positive rate among Kepler multis, together with analysis of Kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validate the closely-packed Kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that has evolved somewhat off of the main sequence. Kepler-33 hosts five transiting planets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.},

abstract = {A new non-linear limb-darkening law, based on the Least-Squares Method (LSM), is presented. This law is able to describe the intensity distribution much more accurately than any of the old ones given that the differences I(model)-I(fitting) are of some order of magnitude smaller than those derived from other approximations. This new law shows several advantages: it represents well the intensity distribution, the flux is conserved with high accuracy and it permits the use of a single law for the whole HR Diagram since the bi-parametric laws are only marginally valid in certain ranges of effective temperatures. The limb-darkening coefficients are computed for the 12 commonly used photometric bands u v b y U B V R I J H K. Bolometric and monochromatic calculations are also available. The computations are presented for 19 metallicities ranging from 10-5 up to 10+1 solar abundances, with log g varying between 0 and 5.0 and effective temperatures between 2000 K-50000 K. Results for microturbulent velocities of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 km/s are also available. With this set of data it was possible to investigate, for the first time, the influence of such parameters in the limb-darkening. Limb-brightening, instead of limb-darkening, was detected for some models. It is shown that the limb-darkening coefficients derived using the Flux Conservation Method (FCM) do not describe very well the intensity distribution, mainly near the border of the disk. On the contrary, the present coefficients, based on the LSM, represent very well the function I($\mu$) at any part of the disk for any filter or wavelength, log g, effective temperature, metallicity and microturbulent velocity. The results are presented in 46 tables for the 12 filters (bolometric) and can be retrieved from the CDS. Due to the size of the remaining tables, mainly the monochromatic, these are available only on request (CD ROMs). Tables 1-47 are available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/Abstract.html.

abstract = {We present a Python package LDTk that automates the calculation of custom stellar limb darkening (LD) profiles and model-specific limb darkening coefficients (LDC) using the library of PHOENIX-generated specific intensity spectra by Husser et al. (2013). The aim of the package is to facilitate analyses requiring custom generated limb darkening profiles, such as the studies of exoplanet transits--especially transmission spectroscopy, where the transit modelling is carried out for custom narrow passbands--eclipsing binaries (EBs), interferometry, and microlensing events. First, LDTk can be used to compute custom limb darkening profiles with uncertainties propagated from the uncertainties in the stellar parameter estimates. Second, LDTk can be used to estimate the limb-darkening-model specific coefficients with uncertainties for the most common limb-darkening models. Third, LDTk can be directly integrated into the log posterior computation of any pre-existing modelling code with minimal modifications. The last approach can be used to constrain the LD model parameter space directly by the LD profile, allowing for the marginalization over the LD parameter space without the need to approximate the constraint from the LD profile using a prior.},

abstract = {The Kepler mission has to date found almost 6,000 planetary transit-like signals, utilizing three years of data for over 170,000 stars at extremely high photometric precision. Due to its design, contamination from eclipsing binaries, variable stars, and other transiting planets results in a significant number of these signals being false positives. This directly affects the determination of the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in our Galaxy, as well as other planet population statistics. In order to detect as many of these false positives as possible, we perform ephemeris matching among all transiting planet, eclipsing binary, and variable star sources. We find that 685 Kepler Objects of Interest - 12{\%} of all those analyzed - are false positives as a result of contamination, due to 409 unique parent sources. Of these, 118 have not previously been identified by other methods. We estimate that {\~{}}35{\%} of KOIs are false positives due to contamination, when performing a first-order correction for observational bias. Comparing single-planet candidate KOIs to multi-planet candidate KOIs, we find an observed false positive fraction due to contamination of 16{\%} and 2.4{\%} respectively, bolstering the existing evidence that multi-planet KOIs are significantly less likely to be false positives. We also analyze the parameter distributions of the ephemeris matches and derive a simple model for the most common type of contamination in the Kepler field. We find that the ephemeris matching technique is able to identify low signal-to-noise false positives that are difficult to identify with other vetting techniques. We expect false positive KOIs to become more frequent when analyzing more quarters of Kepler data, and note that many of them will not be able to be identified based on Kepler data alone.},

abstract = {A decade ago, the detection of the first transiting extrasolar planet provided a direct constraint on its composition and opened the door to spectroscopic investigations of extrasolar planetary atmospheres. Because such characterization studies are feasible only for transiting systems that are both nearby and for which the planet-to-star radius ratio is relatively large, nearby small stars have been surveyed intensively. Doppler studies and microlensing have uncovered a population of planets with minimum masses of 1.9-10 times the Earth's mass (M[symbol:see text]), called super-Earths. The first constraint on the bulk composition of this novel class of planets was afforded by CoRoT-7b (refs 8, 9), but the distance and size of its star preclude atmospheric studies in the foreseeable future. Here we report observations of the transiting planet GJ 1214b, which has a mass of 6.55M[symbol:see text]), and a radius 2.68 times Earth's radius (R[symbol:see text]), indicating that it is intermediate in stature between Earth and the ice giants of the Solar System. We find that the planetary mass and radius are consistent with a composition of primarily water enshrouded by a hydrogen-helium envelope that is only 0.05{\%} of the mass of the planet. The atmosphere is probably escaping hydrodynamically, indicating that it has undergone significant evolution during its history. The star is small and only 13 parsecs away, so the planetary atmosphere is amenable to study with current observatories.},

abstract = {We present twenty-three transit light curves and seven occultation light curves for the ultra-short period planet WASP-43 b, in addition to eight new measurements of the radial velocity of the star. Thanks to this extensive data set, we improve significantly the parameters of the system. Notably, the largely improved precision on the stellar density (2.41+-0.08 rho{\_}sun) combined with constraining the age to be younger than a Hubble time allows us to break the degeneracy of the stellar solution mentioned in the discovery paper. The resulting stellar mass and size are 0.717+-0.025 M{\_}sun and 0.667+-0.011 R{\_}sun. Our deduced physical parameters for the planet are 2.034+-0.052 M{\_}jup and 1.036+-0.019 R{\_}jup. Taking into account its level of irradiation, the high density of the planet favors an old age and a massive core. Our deduced orbital eccentricity, 0.0035(-0.0025,+0.0060), is consistent with a fully circularized orbit. We detect the emission of the planet at 2.09 microns at better than 11-sigma, the deduced occultation depth being 1560+-140 ppm. Our detection of the occultation at 1.19 microns is marginal (790+-320 ppm) and more observations are needed to confirm it. We place a 3-sigma upper limit of 850 ppm on the depth of the occultation at {\~{}}0.9 microns. Together, these results strongly favor a poor redistribution of the heat to the night-side of the planet, and marginally favor a model with no day-side temperature inversion.},

@article{Rajpurohit2013,
abstract = {Despite their large number in the Galaxy, M dwarfs remain elusive objects and the modeling of their photospheres has long remained a challenge (molecular opacities, dust cloud formation). Our objectives are to validate the BT-Settl model atmospheres, update the M dwarf T eff -spectral type relation, and find the atmospheric parameters of the stars in our sample. We compare two samples of optical spectra covering the whole M dwarf sequence with the most recent BT-Settl synthetic spectra and use a $\backslash$c{\{}hi{\}}2 minimization technique to determine Teff . The first sample consists of 97 low-resolution spectra obtained with NTT at La Silla Observatory. The second sample contains 55 mid-resolution spectra obtained at the Siding Spring Observatory (SSO). The spectral typing is realized by comparison with already classified M dwarfs. We show that the BT-Settl synthetic spectra reproduce the slope of the spectral energy distribution and most of its features. Only the CaOH band at 5570{\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} and AlH and NaH hydrides in the blue part of the spectra are still missing in the models. The Teff-scale obtained with the higher resolved SSO 2.3 m spectra is consistent with that obtained with the NTT spectra. We compare our Teff scale with those of other authors and to published isochrones using the BT-Settl colors. We also present relations between effective temperature, spectral type and colors of the M dwarfs.},

abstract = {A crucial step in planet hunting surveys is to select the best candidates for follow up observations, given limited telescope resources. This is often performed by human `eyeballing', a time consuming and statistically awkward process. Here we present a new, fast machine learning technique to separate true planet signals from astrophysical false positives. We use Self Organising Maps (SOMs) to study the transit shapes of $\backslash$emph{\{}Kepler{\}} and $\backslash$emph{\{}K2{\}} known and candidate planets. We find that SOMs are capable of distinguishing known planets from known false positives with a success rate of 87.0$\backslash${\%}, using the transit shape alone. Furthermore, they do not require any candidates to be dispositioned prior to use, meaning that they can be used early in a mission's lifetime. A method for classifying candidates using a SOM is developed, and applied to previously unclassified members of the $\backslash$emph{\{}Kepler{\}} KOI list as well as candidates from the $\backslash$emph{\{}K2{\}} mission. The method is extremely fast, taking minutes to run the entire KOI list on a typical laptop. We make $\backslash$texttt{\{}Python{\}} code for performing classifications publicly available, using either new SOMs or those created in this work. The SOM technique represents a novel method for ranking planetary candidate lists, and can be used both alone or as part of a larger autovetting code.},

abstract = {One of the persistent complications in searches for transiting exoplanets is the low percentage of the detected candidates that ultimately prove to be planets, which significantly increases the load on the telescopes used for the follow-up observations to confirm or reject candidates. Several attempts have been made at creating techniques that can pare down candidate lists without the need of additional observations. Some of these techniques involve a detailed analysis of light curve characteristicsand others estimate the stellar density or some proxy thereof. In this paper, we extend upon this second approach, exploring the use of independently-calculated stellar densities to identify the most promising transiting exoplanet candidates. We use a set of CoRoT candidates and the set of known transiting exoplanets to examine the potential of this approach. In particular, we note the possibilities inherent in the high-precision photometry from space missions, which can detect stellar asteroseismic pulsations from which accurate stellar densities can be extracted without additional observations.},

@article{Diaz2014,
abstract = {A large fraction of the smallest transiting planet candidates discovered by the Kepler and CoRoT space missions cannot be confirmed by a dynamical measurement of the mass using currently available observing facilities. To establish their planetary nature, the concept of planet validation has been advanced. This technique compares the probability of the planetary hypothesis against that of all reasonably conceivable alternative false-positive (FP) hypotheses. The candidate is considered as validated if the posterior probability of the planetary hypothesis is sufficiently larger than the sum of the probabilities of all FP scenarios. In this paper, we present PASTIS, the Planet Analysis and Small Transit Investigation Software, a tool designed to perform a rigorous model comparison of the hypotheses involved in the problem of planet validation, and to fully exploit the information available in the candidate light curves. PASTIS self-consistently models the transit light curves and follow-up observations. Its object-oriented structure offers a large flexibility for defining the scenarios to be compared. The performance is explored using artificial transit light curves of planets and FPs with a realistic error distribution obtained from a Kepler light curve. We find that data support for the correct hypothesis is strong only when the signal is high enough (transit signal-to-noise ratio above 50 for the planet case) and remains inconclusive otherwise. PLATO shall provide transits with high enough signal-to-noise ratio, but to establish the true nature of the vast majority of Kepler and CoRoT transit candidates additional data or strong reliance on hypotheses priors is needed.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the intrinsic colors and temperatures of 5-30 Myr old pre-main sequence (pre-MS) stars using the F0 through M9 type members of nearby, negligibly reddened groups: Eta Cha cluster, TW Hydra Association, Beta Pic Moving Group, and Tucana-Horologium Association. To check the consistency of spectral types from the literature, we estimate new spectral types for 52 nearby pre-MS stars with spectral types F3 through M4 using optical spectra taken with the SMARTS 1.5-m telescope. Combining these new types with published spectral types, and photometry from the literature (Johnson-Cousins BVIc, 2MASS JHKs and WISE W1, W2, W3, and W4), we derive a new empirical spectral type-color sequence for 5-30 Myr old pre-MS stars. Colors for pre-MS stars match dwarf colors for some spectral types and colors, but for other spectral types and colors, deviations can exceed 0.3 mag. We estimate effective temperatures (Teff) and bolometric corrections (BCs) for our pre-MS star sample through comparing their photometry to synthetic photometry generated using the BT-Settl grid of model atmosphere spectra. We derive a new Teff and BC scale for pre-MS stars, which should be a more appropriate match for T Tauri stars than often-adopted dwarf star scales. While our new Teff scale for pre-MS stars is within {\~{}}100 K of dwarfs at a given spectral type for stars {\textless}G5, for G5 through K6, the pre-MS stars are {\~{}}250 K cooler than their main sequence counterparts. Lastly, we present (1) a modern Teff, optical/IR color, and bolometric correction sequence for O9V-M9V MS stars based on an extensive literature survey, (2) a revised Q-method relation for dereddening UBV photometry of OB-type stars, and (3) introduce two candidate spectral standard stars as representatives of spectral types K8V and K9V.},

abstract = {Abridged) Low-mass stars have been recognised as promising targets in the search for rocky, small planets with the potential of supporting life. Doppler search programmes using high-resolution spectrographs like HARPS or HARPS-N are providing huge quantities of optical spectra of M dwarfs. We aim to calibrate empirical relationships to determine stellar parameters for early M dwarfs (spectral types M0-M4.5) using the same spectra that are used for the radial velocity determinations. Our methodology consists in the use of ratios of pseudo equivalent widths of spectral features as a temperature diagnostic. Stars with effective temperatures obtained from interferometric estimates of their radii are used as calibrators. Empirical calibrations for the spectral type are also provided. Combinations of features and ratios of features are used to derive calibrations for the stellar metallicity. Our methods are then applied to a large sample of M dwarfs that are being observed in the framework of the HARPS search for extrasolar planets.The derived temperatures and metallicities are used together with photometric estimates of mass, radius, and surface gravity to calibrate empirical relationships for these parameters. A total of 112 temperature sensitive ratios have been calibrated over the range 3100-3950 K, providing Teff values with typical uncertainties of the order of 70 K. Eighty-two ratios of pseudo equivalent widths of features were calibrated to derive spectral types. Regarding stellar metallicity, 696 combinations of pseudo equivalent widths of individual features and temperature-sensitive ratios have been calibrated, over the metallicity range from -0.54 to +0.24 dex, with estimated uncertainties in the range of 0.07-0.10 dex. We provide our own empirical calibrations for stellar mass, radius, and surface gravity.},

abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 sec readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 sec candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg2) and a large photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2{\%}, 4-10{\%} and 10{\%} for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50{\%} of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0.},

abstract = {Context. The CoRoT mission, a pioneer in exoplanet searches from space, has completed its first 150 days of continuous observations of {\~{}}12000 stars in the galactic plane. An analysis of the raw data identifies the most promising candidates and triggers the ground-based follow-up. Aims. We report on the discovery of the transiting planet CoRoT-Exo-2b, with a period of 1.743 days, and characterize its main parameters. Methods. We filter the CoRoT raw light curve of cosmic impacts, orbital residuals, and low frequency signals from the star. The folded light curve of 78 transits is fitted to a model to obtain the main parameters. Radial velocity data obtained with the SOPHIE, CORALIE and HARPS spectro-graphs are combined to characterize the system. The 2.5 min binned phase-folded light curve is affected by the effect of sucessive occultations of stellar active regions by the planet, and the dispersion in the out of transit part reaches a level of 1.09x10-4 in flux units. Results. We derive a radius for the planet of 1.465+-0.029 R{\_}Jup and a mass of 3.31+-0.16 M{\_}Jup, corresponding to a density of 1.31+-0.04 g/cm{\^{}}3. The large radius of CoRoT-Exo-2b cannot be explained by current models of evolution of irradiated planets.},

These systematics, mistakenly identified as planet transits, can have a strong impact on occurrence rate calculations because they cluster in a region of parameter space where Kepler's sensitivity to planets is poor. We compare individual transit-like events to a variety of models of real transits and systematic events, and use a Bayesian Information Criterion to evaluate the likelihood that each event is real. We describe our technique and test its performance on simulated data.

@article{Lang2010,
abstract = {We have built a reliable and robust system that takes as input an astronomical image, and returns as output the pointing, scale, and orientation of that image (the astrometric calibration or WCS information). The system requires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels alone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the "lost in space" problem in which nothing--not even the image scale--is known. After robust source detection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five stars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate hypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as true if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a background hypothesis. With indices built from the USNO-B Catalog and designed for uniformity of coverage and redundancy, the success rate is 99.9{\%} for contemporary near-ultraviolet and visual imaging survey data, with no false positives. The failure rate is consistent with the incompleteness of the USNO-B Catalog; augmentation with indices built from the 2MASS Catalog brings the completeness to 100{\%} with no false positives. We are using this system to generate consistent and standards-compliant meta-data for digital and digitized imaging from plate repositories, automated observatories, individual scientific investigators, and hobbyists. This is the first step in a program of making it possible to trust calibration meta-data for astronomical data of arbitrary provenance.},

abstract = {Context: CoRoT is a pioneering space mission whose primary goals are stellar seismology and extrasolar planets search. Its surveys of large stellar fields generate numerous planetary candidates whose lightcurves have transit-like features. An extensive analytical and observational follow-up effort is undertaken to classify these candidates. Aims: The list of planetary transit candidates from the CoRoT LRa01 star field in the Monoceros constellation towards the Galactic anti-center is presented. The CoRoT observations of LRa01 lasted from 24 October 2007 to 3 March 2008. Methods: 7470 chromatic and 3938 monochromatic lightcurves were acquired and analysed. Instrumental noise and stellar variability were treated with several filtering tools by different teams from the CoRoT community. Different transit search algorithms were applied to the lightcurves. Results: Fifty-one stars were classified as planetary transit candidates in LRa01. Thirty-seven (i.e., 73 {\%} of all candidates) are "good" planetary candidates based on photometric analysis only. Thirty-two (i.e., 87 {\%} of the "good" candidates) have been followed-up. At the time of this writing twenty-two cases have been solved and five planets have been discovered: three transiting hot-Jupiters (CoRoT-5b, CoRoT-12b, and CoRoT-21b), the first terrestrial transiting planet (CoRoT-7b), and another planet in the same system (CoRoT-7c, detected by radial velocity survey only). Evidences of another non-transiting planet in the CoRoT-7 system, namely CoRoT-7d, have been recently found.},

abstract = {Wide-field surveys for transiting planets, such as the NASA Kepler and TESS missions, are usually conducted without knowing which stars have binary companions. Unresolved and unrecognized binaries give rise to systematic errors in planet occurrence rates, including misclassified planets and mistakes in completeness corrections. The individual errors can have different signs, making it difficult to anticipate the net effect on inferred occurrence rates. Here we use simplified models of signal-to-noise limited transit surveys to try and clarify the situation. We derive a formula for the apparent occurrence rate density measured by an observer who falsely assumes all stars are single. The formula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary stars; and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and single stars. It also takes into account the Malmquist bias by which binaries are over-represented in flux-limited samples. Application of the formula to an idealized Kepler-like survey shows that for planets larger than 2 {\$}R{\_}\backslashoplus{\$}, the net systematic error is of order 5{\%}. In particular, unrecognized binaries are unlikely to be the reason for the apparent discrepancies between hot Jupiter occurrence rates measured in different surveys. For smaller planets the errors are potentially larger: the occurrence of Earth-sized planets could be overestimated by as much as 50{\%}. We also show that whenever high-resolution imaging reveals a transit host star to be a binary, the planet is usually more likely to orbit the primary star than the secondary star.},

We combine our 15 new light curves with 52 others from literature, to analyze homogeneously all the available transit light curves of this exoplanet. By extending the time span of the monitoring of the transits to more than {\$}5{\~{}}yr{\$}, and by analyzing the individual mid-times of 72 transits, we study the proposed shortening of the orbital period of WASP-43b. We estimate that the times of transit are well-matched by our updated ephemeris equation, using a constant orbital period. We estimate an orbital period change rate no larger than {\$}\backslashdot{\{}P{\}}=-0.02 \backslashpm 6.6{\~{}}ms{\~{}}yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, which is fully consistent with a constant period. Based on the timing analysis, we discard stellar tidal dissipation factors {\$}Q{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\textless}10{\^{}}{\{}5{\}}{\$}. In addition, with the modelling of the transits we update the system parameters: {\$}a/Rs=4.867(23){\$}, {\$}i=82.11(10){\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$} and {\$}R{\_}p/R{\_}s=0.15942(41){\$}, noticing a difference in the relative size of the planet between optical and NIR bands.},

abstract = {We present astrophysical false positive probability calculations for every Kepler Object of Interest (KOI)---the first large-scale demonstration of a fully automated transiting planet validation procedure. Out of 7056 KOIs, we determine that 1935 have probabilities {\textless}1{\%} to be astrophysical false positives, and thus may be considered validated planets. 1284 of these have not yet been validated or confirmed by other methods. In addition, we identify 428 KOIs likely to be false positives that have not yet been identified as such, though some of these may be a result of unidentified transit timing variations. A side product of these calculations is full stellar property posterior samplings for every host star, modeled as single, binary, and triple systems. These calculations use 'vespa', a publicly available Python package able to be easily applied to any transiting exoplanet candidate.},

@article{Guenther2013,
abstract = {Studies of transiting extrasolar planets are of key importance for understanding the nature of planets outside our solar system because their masses, diameters, and bulk densities can be measured. An important part of transit-search programmes is the removal of false-positives. The critical question is how many of the candidates that passed all previous tests are false positives. For our study we selected 25 CoRoT candidates that have already been screened against false-positives using detailed analysis of the light curves and seeing-limited imaging, which has transits that are between 0.7 and 0.05{\%} deep. We observed 20 candidates with the adaptive optics imager NaCo and 18 with the high-resolution infrared spectrograph CRIRES. We found previously unknown stars within 2 arcsec of the targets in seven of the candidates. All of these are too faint and too close to the targets to have been previously detected with seeing-limited telescopes in the optical. Our study thus leads to the surprising results that if we remove all candidates excluded by the sophisticated analysis of the light-curve, as well as carrying out deep imaging with seeing-limited telescopes, still 28-35{\%} of the remaining candidates are found to possess companions that are bright enough to be false-positives. Given that the companion-candidates cluster around the targets and that the J-K colours are consistent with physical companions, we conclude that the companion-candidates are more likely to be physical companions rather than unrelated field stars.},

abstract = {We report the detection of transit timing variations (TTVs) well in excess of one hour in the Kepler multi-planet candidate system KOI 806. This system exhibits transits consistent with three separate planets -- a Super-Earth, a Jupiter, and a Saturn -- lying very nearly in a 1:2:5 resonance, respectively. We used the Kepler public data archive and observations with the Gran Telescopio de Canarias to compile the necessary photometry. For the largest candidate planet (KOI 806.02) in this system, we detected a large transit timing variation of -103.5{\$}\backslashpm{\$}6.9 minutes against previously published ephemeris. We did not obtain a strong detection of a transit color signature consistent with a planet-sized object; however, we did not detect a color difference in transit depth, either. The large TTV is consistent with theoretical predictions that exoplanets in resonance can produce large transit timing variations, particularly if the orbits are eccentric. The presence of large TTVs among the bodies in this systems indicates that KOI806 is very likely to be a planetary system. This is supported by the lack of a strong color dependence in the transit depth, which would suggest a blended eclipsing binary.},

abstract = {When an extrasolar planet passes in front of (transits) its star, its radius can be measured from the decrease in starlight and its orbital period from the time between transits. Multiple planets transiting the same star reveal much more: period ratios determine stability and dynamics, mutual gravitational interactions reflect planet masses and orbital shapes, and the fraction of transiting planets observed as multiples has implications for the planarity of planetary systems. But few stars have more than one known transiting planet, and none has more than three. Here we report Kepler spacecraft observations of a single Sun-like star, which we call Kepler-11, that reveal six transiting planets, five with orbital periods between 10 and 47 days and a sixth planet with a longer period. The five inner planets are among the smallest for which mass and size have both been measured, and these measurements imply substantial envelopes of light gases. The degree of coplanarity and proximity of the planetary orbits imply energy dissipation near the end of planet formation.},

We also present evolutionary models for irradiated planets, coupling for the first time irradiated atmosphere profiles and inner structures. We focus on HD 209458-like systems and show that irradiation effects can substantially affect the radius of sub-jovian mass giant planets. Irradiation effects, however, cannot alone explain the large observed radius of HD 209458b. Adopting assumptions which optimise irradiation effects and taking into account the extension of the outer atmospheric layers, we still find {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 20{\%} discrepancy between observed and theoretical radii.

   \caption{Examples of synthetic images generated from BigGAN on ImageNet. Certain categories (right column) are easier to model, and the synthetic images are more realistic. The model struggle to produce plausible images for other categories (left column).
   From left to right, top to bottom, the categories are n01440764: \texttt{tench}, n01828970: \texttt{bee eater}, n02672831: \texttt{accordion}, n02086646: \texttt{Blenheim spaniel}, n02791124: \texttt{barber chair}, and n12998815: \texttt{agaric}.}

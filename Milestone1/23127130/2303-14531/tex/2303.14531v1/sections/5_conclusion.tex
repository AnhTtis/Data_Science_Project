\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we propose SIO, a training framework that utilizes synthetic ID samples and a weighted objective to benefit OOD detection.
SIO can be easily integrated with existing approaches and consistently improves OOD detection performance on top of multiple OOD detectors.
Importantly, our findings suggest that training with additional and diverse synthetic ID data benefits OOD detection, which may open up new directions for future research.
As generative models continue to advance, we expect SIO to remain an effective and versatile component for OOD detection.

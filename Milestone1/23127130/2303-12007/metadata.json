    "abstract": "Let $Σ$ be a smooth closed oriented surface of genus $\\geq 2$. We prove that two metrics on $Σ$ with the same marked length spectrum and Anosov geodesic flow are isometric via an isometry isotopic to the identity. The proof combines microlocal tools with the geometry of complex curves.",

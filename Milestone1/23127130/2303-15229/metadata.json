    "abstract": "In this paper we parallel the construction of Tong of a gauge theory for shallow water, by writing a gauge theory for the Euler fluid in 2+1 dimensions. We then extend it to an Euler fluid coupled to electromagnetic background. We argue that the gauge theory formulation provides a topological argument for the quantization of 2+1 dimensional Euler Hopfion solution. In the process, we find a (non-gauge) action for the Euler fluid that can be extended to any dimension, including the physical 3+1 dimensions. We discuss several aspects of the ABC flow.",

The historical context with regard to the origin of the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) program is important for understanding why federal government agencies launched this new, long-term high-performance computing program and renewed their commitment to leadership computing in support of national security, large science and space requirements at the start of the 21st century. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the context for this work as well as various procedures being undertaken for evaluating the effectiveness of this activity including such topics as modelling the proposed performance of the new machines, evaluating the proposed architectures, understanding the languages used to program these machines as well as understanding programmer productivity issues in order to better prepare for the introduction of these machines in the 2011–2015 timeframe.}

%   Nomadic threads. Software approach for migrating threads.
%   Does not migrate the entire stack, but instead an activation
%   frame that has everything the thread needs for its assigned
%   code block. So threads are associated with code blocks, like
%   a loop iteration, or an entire loop, etc.

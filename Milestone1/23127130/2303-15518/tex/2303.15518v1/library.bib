    abstract = "{We study the properties of gas inside and around galaxy haloes as a function of radius and halo mass, focusing mostly on z= 2, but also showing some results for z= 0. For this purpose, we use a suite of large cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. The properties of cold- and hot-mode gas, which we separate depending on whether the temperature has been higher than 105.5 K while it was extragalactic, are clearly distinguishable in the outer parts of massive haloes (virial temperatures ≫105 K). The differences between cold- and hot-mode gas resemble those between inflowing and outflowing gas. The cold-mode gas is mostly confined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium with the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas typically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling. However, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given mode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong statements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong cooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas accreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback results in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii. The gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also account for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass. We argue that cold streams penetrating hot haloes are observable as high column density H i Lyman α absorption systems in sightlines near massive foreground galaxies.}",

abstract = {Star formation in half of massive galaxies was quenched by the time the Universe was 3 billion years old1. Very low amounts of molecular gas seem to be responsible for this, at least in some cases2–7, although morphological gas stabilization, shock heating or activity associated with accretion onto a central supermassive black hole are invoked in other cases8–11. Recent studies of quenching by gas depletion have been based on upper limits that are insufficiently sensitive to determine this robustly2–7, or stacked emission with its problems of averaging8,9. Here we report 1.3 mm observations of dust emission from 6 strongly lensed galaxies where star formation has been quenched, with magnifications of up to a factor of 30. Four of the six galaxies are undetected in dust emission, with an estimated upper limit on the dust mass of 0.0001 times the stellar mass, and by proxy (assuming a Milky Way molecular gas-to-dust ratio) 0.01 times the stellar mass in molecular gas. This is two orders of magnitude less molecular gas per unit stellar mass than seen in star forming galaxies at similar redshifts12–14. It remains difficult to extrapolate from these small samples, but these observations establish that gas depletion is responsible for a cessation of star formation in some fraction of high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a galaxy cluster at z = 1.62 located in the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic survey XMM-LSS field. This structure was selected solely as an overdensity of galaxies with red Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera colors, satisfying ([3.6] - [4.5])AB> - 0.1mag. Photometric redshifts derived from the Subaru XMM Deep Survey (BViz bands), the UKIRT Infrared Deep Survey-Ultra-Deep Survey (UKIDSS-UDS, JK bands), and from the Spitzer Public UDS survey (3.6-8.0 $\mu$m) show that this cluster corresponds to a surface density of galaxies at z 1.6 that is >20$\sigma$ above the mean at this redshift. We obtained optical spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the cluster region using IMACS on the Magellan telescope. We measured redshifts for seven galaxies in the range z = 1.62-1.63 within 2.8arcmin (<1.4Mpc) of the astrometric center of the cluster. A posteriori analysis of the XMM data in this field reveal a weak (4$\sigma$) detection in the [0.5-2keV] band compatible with the expected thermal emission from such a cluster. The color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies in this cluster shows a prominent red sequence, dominated by a population of red galaxies with (z - J)>1.7mag. The photometric-redshift probability distributions for the red galaxies are strongly peaked at z = 1.62, coincident with the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. The rest-frame (U - B) color and scatter of galaxies on the red sequence are consistent with a mean luminosity-weighted age of 1.2 0.1Gyr, yielding a formation redshift , and corresponding to the last significant star formation period in these galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {We investigate the physical conditions of ionized gas in high-z star-forming galaxies using diagnostic diagrams based on the rest-frame optical emission lines. The sample consists of 701 galaxies with an Ha detection at $1.4\lesssim z\lesssim1.7$, from the FMOS-COSMOS survey, that represent the normal star-forming population over the stellar mass range $10^{9.6} \lesssim M_\ast/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{11.6}$ with those at $M_\ast>10^{11}\simM_\odot$ being well sampled. We confirm an offset of the average location of star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram ([OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha), primarily towards higher [OIII]/Hb, compared with local galaxies. Based on the [SII] ratio, we measure an electron density ($n_e=220^{+170}_{-130}\sim\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), that is higher than that of local galaxies. Based on comparisons to theoretical models, we argue that changes in emission-line ratios, including the offset in the BPT diagram, are caused by a higher ionization parameter both at fixed stellar mass and at fixed metallicity with additional contributions from a higher gas density and possibly a hardening of the ionizing radiation field. Ionization due to AGNs is ruled out as assessed with Chandra. As a consequence, we revisit the mass-metallicity relation using [NII]/Ha and a new calibration including [NII]/[SII] as recently introduced by Dopita et al. Consistent with our previous results, the most massive galaxies ($M_\ast\gtrsim10^{11}\simM_\odot$) are fully enriched, while those at lower masses have metallicities lower than local galaxies. Finally, we demonstrate that the stellar masses, metallicities and star formation rates of the FMOS sample are well fit with a physically-motivated model for the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies.},

abstract = {We investigate how environment affects satellite galaxies using their location within the projected phase space of their host haloes from the Wang et al.'s group catalogue. Using the Yonsei Zoom-in Cluster Simulations, we derive zones of constant mean infall time T inf in projected phase space, and catalogue in which zone each observed galaxy falls. Within each zone, we compute the mean observed galaxy properties including specific star formation rate, luminosity-weighted age, stellar metallicity, and [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratio. By comparing galaxies in different zones, we inspect how shifting the mean infall time from recent infallers (T inf < 3 Gyr) to ancient infallers (T inf > 5 Gyr) impacts galaxy properties at fixed stellar and halo mass. Ancient infallers are more quenched, and the impact of environmental quenching is visible down to low host masses (≤group masses). Meanwhile, the quenching of recent infallers is weakly dependent on host mass, indicating they have yet to respond strongly to their current environment. [$\alpha$/Fe] and especially metallicity are less dependent on host mass, but show a dependence on T inf . We discuss these results in the context of longer exposure times for ancient infallers to environmental effects, which grow more efficient in hosts with a deeper potential well and a denser intracluster medium. We also compare our satellites with a control field sample, and find that even the most recent infallers (T inf < 2 Gyr) are more quenched than field galaxies, in particular for cluster mass hosts. This supports the role of pre-processing and/or faster quenching in satellites.},

abstract = {We present results on the emission-line properties of 1.3<=z<=2.7 galaxies drawn from the complete MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. Specifically, we use observations of the emission-line diagnostic diagram of [OIII]5007/Hb vs. [SII]6717,6731/Ha, i.e., the "[SII] BPT diagram," to gain insight into the physical properties of high-redshift star-forming regions. High-redshift MOSDEF galaxies are offset towards lower [SII]6717,6731/Ha at fixed [OIII]5007/Hb, relative to local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Furthermore, at fixed [OIII]5007/Hb, local SDSS galaxies follow a trend of decreasing [SII]6717,6731/Ha as the surface density of star formation (Sigma_SFR) increases. We explain this trend in terms of the decreasing fractional contribution from diffuse ionized gas (f_DIG) as Sigma_SFR increases in galaxies, which causes galaxy-integrated line ratios to shift towards the locus of pure HII-region emission. The z$\sim$0 relationship between f_DIG and Sigma_SFR implies that high-redshift galaxies have lower f_DIG values than typical local systems, given their significantly higher typical Sigma_SFR. When an appropriate low-redshift benchmark with zero or minimal f_DIG is used, high-redshift MOSDEF galaxies appear offset towards higher [SII]6717,6731/Ha and/or [OIII]5007/Hb. The joint shifts of high-redshift galaxies in the [SII] and [NII] BPT diagrams are best explained in terms of the harder spectra ionizing their star-forming regions at fixed nebular oxygen abundance (expected for chemically-young galaxies), as opposed to large variations in N/O ratios or higher ionization parameters. The evolving mixture of HII regions and DIG is an essential ingredient to our description of the ISM over cosmic time.},

abstract = {Cosmological numerical simulations of galaxy evolution show that accretion of metal-poor gas from the cosmic web drives the star formation in galaxy disks. Unfortunately, the observational support for this theoretical prediction is still indirect, and modeling and analysis are required to identify hints as actual signs of star-formation feeding from metal-poor gas accretion. Thus, a meticulous interpretation of the observations is crucial, and this observational review begins with a simple theoretical description of the physical process and the key ingredients it involves, including the properties of the accreted gas and of the star-formation that it induces. A number of observations pointing out the connection between metal-poor gas accretion and star-formation are analyzed, specifically, the short gas consumption time-scale compared to the age of the stellar populations, the fundamental metallicity relationship, the relationship between disk morphology and gas metallicity, the existence of metallicity drops in starbursts of star-forming galaxies, the so-called G dwarf problem, the existence of a minimum metallicity for the star-forming gas in the local universe, the origin of the alpha-enhanced gas forming stars in the local universe, the metallicity of the quiescent BCDs, and the direct measurements of gas accretion onto galaxies. A final section discusses intrinsic difficulties to obtain direct observational evidence, and points out alternative observational pathways to further consolidate the current ideas.},

The cluster redshift and velocity dispersion are $z_{\backslashrm cl}=1.6233\backslashpm0.0003$ and $\backslashsigma{\_}{\backslashrm cl}=254\backslashpm50$ km s$^{-1}$. We reach NIR line sensitivities of $\backslashsim0.3\backslashtimes10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ that, combined with multi-wavelength photometry, provide extinction-corrected H$\backslashalpha{\$} star formation rates (SFR), gas phase metallicities from [NII]/H$\backslashalpha{\$}, and stellar masses. We measure an integrated H$\backslashalpha{\$} SFR of $\backslashsim325{\backslashrm M}_{\backslashodot{\}}$ yr$^{-1}$ (26 members; R$_{\backslashrm proj}<2$ Mpc) and show that the elevated star formation in the cluster core (R$_{\backslashrm proj}<0.25$ Mpc) is driven by the concentration of star-forming members, but the average SFR per H$\backslashalpha{\$}-detected galaxy is half that of members at R$_{\backslashrm proj}\backslashsim1$ Mpc. However, we do not detect any environmental imprint when comparing attenuation and gas phase metallicities: the cluster galaxies show similar trends with M$_{\backslashstar{\}}$ as to the field, e.g. more massive galaxies have larger stellar attenuation. IRC 0218's gas phase metallicity-M$_{\backslashstar{\}}$ relation (MZR) is offset to lower metallicities relative to $z\backslashsim0$ and has a slope of $0.13\backslashpm0.10$. Comparing the MZR in IRC 0218 to the COSMOS cluster at $z=2.1$ shows no evolution ($\backslashDelta t\backslashsim1$ Gyr): the MZR for both galaxy clusters are remarkably consistent with each other and virtually identical to several field surveys at $z\backslashsim2$.},

abstract = {The intergalactic medium (IGM) is the dominant reservoir of baryons, delineates the large-scale structure of the universe at low to moderate overdensities, and provides gas from which galaxies form and evolve. Simulations of a cold-dark-matter- (CDM-) dominated universe predict that the IGM is distributed in a cosmic web of filaments and that galaxies should form along and at the intersections of these filaments. While observations of QSO absorption lines and the large-scale distribution of galaxies have confirmed the CDM paradigm, the cosmic web of IGM has never been confirmed by direct imaging. Here we report our observation of the Ly$\alpha$ blob 2 (LAB2) in SSA22 with the Cosmic Web Imager (CWI). This is an integral field spectrograph optimized for low surface brightness, extended emission.With 22 hr of total on- and off-source exposure, CWI has revealed that LAB2 has extended Ly$\alpha$ emission that is organized into azimuthal zones consistent with filaments. We perform numerous tests with simulations and the data to secure the robustness of this result, which relies on data with modest signal-to-noise ratios. We have developed a smoothing algorithm that permits visualization of data cube slices along image or spectral image planes. With both raw and smoothed data cubes we demonstrate that the filaments are kinematically associated with LAB2 and display double-peaked profiles characteristic of optically thick Ly$\alpha$ emission. The flux is 10-20 times brighter than expected for the average emission from the IGM but is consistent with boosted fluorescence from a buried QSO or gravitation cooling radiation. Using simple emission models, we infer a baryon mass in the filaments of at least 1-4 × 1011M, and the dark halo mass is at least 2 × 1012. The spatial-kinematic morphology is more consistent with inflow from the cosmic web than outflow from LAB2, although an outflow feature maybe present at one azimuth. LAB2 and the surrounding gas have significant and coaligned angular momentum, strengthening the case for their association.},

abstract = {MOSFIRE is a unique multi-object spectrometer and imager for the Cassegrain focus of the 10 m Keck 1 telescope. A refractive optical design provides near-IR (0.97 to 2.45 m) multi-object spectroscopy over a 6.14' x 6.14' field of view with a resolving power of R$\sim$3,270 for a 0.7" slit width (2.9 pixels in the dispersion direction), or imaging over a field of view of 6.8' diameter with 0.18" per pixel sampling. A single diffraction grating can be set at two fixed angles, and order-sorting filters provide spectra that cover the K, H, J or Y bands by selecting 3rd, 4 th , 5 th or 6 th order respectively. A folding flat following the field lens is equipped with piezo transducers to provide tip/tilt control for flexure compensation at the 0.1 pixel level. A special feature of MOSFIRE is that its multiplex advantage of up to 46 slits is achieved using a cryogenic Configurable Slit Unit or CSU developed in collaboration with the Swiss Centre for Electronics and Micro Technology (CSEM). The CSU is reconfigurable under remote control in less than 5 minutes without any thermal cycling of the instrument. Slits are formed by moving opposable bars from both sides of the focal plane. An individual slit has a length of 7.1" but bar positions can be aligned to make longer slits. When masking bars are removed to their full extent and the grating is changed to a mirror, MOSFIRE becomes a wide-field imager. Using a single, ASIC-driven, 2K x 2K H2-RG HgCdTe array from Teledyne Imaging Sensors with exceptionally low dark current and low noise, MOSFIRE will be extremely sensitive and ideal for a wide range of science applications. This paper describes the design and testing of the instrument prior to delivery later in 2010.},

abstract = {Using a large (14,857), homogenously selected sample of cluster galaxies identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4), we investigate the impact of cluster membership and local density on the stellar mass-gas phase metallicity relation (MZR). We show that stellar metallicities are not suitable for this work, being relatively insensitive to subtle changes in the MZR. Accurate nebular abundances can be obtained for 1318 cluster galaxies in our sample and we show that these galaxies are drawn from clusters that are fully repesentative of the parent sample in terms of mass, size, velocity dispersion and richness. By comparing the MZR of the cluster galaxies with a sample control of galaxies matched in mass, redshift, fibre covering fraction and rest-frame g-r colour cluster galaxies are found to have, on average, higher metallicities by up to 0.04 dex. The magnitude of this offset does not depend strongly on galactic half-light radius or cluster properties such as velocity dispersion or cluster mass. The effect of local density on the MZR is investigated, using the presence of a near neighbour and both two- and three-dimensional density estimators. For all three metrics, it is found that the cluster galaxies in locally rich environments have higher median metallicities by up to $\sim$ 0.05 dex than those in locally poor environments (or without a near neighbour). Control (non-cluster) galaxies at locally high densities exhibit similar metal-enhancements. Taken together, these results show that galaxies in clusters are, on average, slightly more metal-rich than the field, but that this effect is driven by local overdensity and not simply cluster membership.},

abstract = {Star formation rate (SFR) distributions of galaxies are often assumed to be bimodal with modes corresponding to star-forming and quiescent galaxies, respectively. Both classes of galaxies are typically studied separately and SFR distributions of star-forming galaxies are commonly modelled as lognormals. Using both observational data and results from numerical simulations, I argue that this division into star-forming and quiescent galaxies is unnecessary from a theoretical point of view and that the SFR distributions of the whole population can be well fit by zero-inflated negative binomial distributions. This family of distributions has 3 parameters that determine the average SFR of the galaxies in the sample, the scatter relative to the star-forming sequence, and the fraction of galaxies with zero SFRs, respectively. The proposed distributions naturally account for (i) the discrete nature of star formation, (ii) the presence of 'dead' galaxies with zero SFRs, and (iii) asymmetric scatter. Excluding 'dead' galaxies, the distribution of log SFR is unimodal with a peak at the star forming sequence and an extended tail towards low SFRs. However, uncertainties and biases in the SFR measurements can create the appearance of a bimodal distribution.},

abstract = {Context. Tidal interactions of galaxies in galaxy clusters have been proposed as one potential explanation of the morphology-density relation at low masses. Earlier studies have shown that galaxy harassment is a suitable mechanism for inducing a morphological transformation from low-mass late-type disk galaxies to the abundant early-type galaxies. Aims. The efficiency of tidal transformation is expected to depend strongly on the orbit of a galaxy within the cluster halo. The orbit determines both the strength of the cluster's global tidal field and the probability of encounters with other cluster members. Here we aim to explore these dependencies. Methods. We use a combination of N-body simulation and Monte-Carlo method to study the efficiency of the transformation of late-type galaxies by tidal interactions on different orbits in a galaxy cluster. Additionally, we investigate the effect of an inclination between the disk of the infalling galaxy and its orbital plane. We compare our results to observational data to assess the possible relevance of such transformations for the existing cluster galaxy population. Results. We find that galaxies that entered a cluster from the outskirts are unlikely to be significantly transformed (stellar mass loss  Closer to the cluster centre, tidal interactions are a more efficient mechanism (stellar mass loss up to 50%) for producing harassed galaxies. The inclination of the disk can reduce the mass loss significantly, yet it amplifies the thickening of the galaxy disk. Galaxies with smaller sizes on intermediate orbits are nearly unaffected by tidal interactions. The tidal influence on an infalling galaxy and the likelihood that it leads to galaxy harassment make a very stochastical process that depends on the galaxy's specific history. Conclusions. We conclude that harassment is a suitable mechanism that could explain the transformation of at least a fraction of galaxies inside galaxy clusters. However, the transformation would have to start at an early epoch in protocluster environments and continue until today, in order to result in a complete morphological transformation.},

For this analysis, we combine photometric and spectroscopic parameters from the UltraVISTA and Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) surveys in the COSMOS field and environmental measurements. We analyze the trends with overdensity (1+{\$}\backslashdelta{\$}) on the rotational support of quiescent galaxies and find no universal trends at either fixed mass or fixed stellar velocity dispersion. This is consistent with previous studies of the local Universe; rotational support of massive galaxies depends primarily on stellar mass. We highlight two populations of massive galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog M{\_}\backslashstar/M{\_}\backslashodot\backslashgeq11{\$}) that deviate from the average mass relation. First, the most massive galaxies in the most under-dense regions ({\$}(1+\backslashdelta)\backslashleq1{\$}) exhibit elevated rotational support. Similarly, at the highest masses ({\$}\backslashlog M{\_}\backslashstar/M{\_}\backslashodot\backslashgeq11.25{\$}) the range in rotational support is significant in all but the densest regions. This corresponds to an increasing slow-rotator fraction such that only galaxies in the densest environments ({\$}(1+\backslashdelta)\backslashgeq3.5{\$}) are primarily (90{\$}\backslashpm{\$}10$\backslash${\%}) slow-rotators.This effect is not seen at fixed velocity dispersion, suggesting minor merging as the driving mechanism: only in the densest regions have the most massive galaxies experienced significant minor merging, building stellar mass and diminishing rotation without significantly affecting the central stellar velocity dispersion.

abstract = {The goal of this work is to infer the star formation properties and the mass assembly process of high-redshift galaxies from their IR emission using the 24 $\mu$m band of MIPS-Spitzer. We used the GOODS-MUSIC catalog, with multiwavelength coverage from 0.3 to 8 $\mu$m and spectroscopic or accurate photometric redshifts. We describe how this catalog has been extended with the addition of mid-IR fluxes derived from MIPS 24 $\mu$m image. As for the Star Formation Rate (hereafter SFR), we compared two different tracers: IR emission by reprocessed UV photons and UV luminosity corrected for dust reddening. The former has been estimated using both synthetic and empirical templates, the latter has been derived from a SED fitting technique over optical-to-IR bands. We show that, apart from a few outliers, there is a general consistency among these indicators. The relation between the specific SFR (SSFR) and the total stellar mass confirms the well-known downsizing scenario, as we find that the most massive galaxies have higher star formation activity at higher redshifts. A preliminary comparison with the theoretical predictions of the Millennium Simulation shows that such model provides an overall consistency with the SSFR distribution, including the existence of quiescent galaxies even at z > 1.5. However, the average SSFR observed in the more active galaxies is systematically underpredicted by a factor up to ∼ 2-3 increasing with redshift. {\textcopyright} Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fisica.},

We match the stellar mass and star formation rate distributions of the two populations. By z = 1, only 36 of the extended massive galaxies have quenched, in contrast to a quenched fraction of 69 for the normal-size massive galaxies. We find that normal-size massive galaxies build up their central stellar mass without a significant increase in their stellar size between z = 2−4, whereas the stellar size of the extended massive galaxies almost doubles in the same time. In IllustrisTNG, lower black hole masses and weaker kinetic-mode feedback appears to be responsible for the delayed quenching of star formation in the extended massive galaxies. We show that relatively gas-poor mergers may be responsible for the lower central stellar density and weaker supermassive black hole feedback in the extended massive galaxies.},

abstract = {In the past five years, deep imaging campaigns conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based observatories have delivered large samples of galaxies at 6.5<z<10, providing our first glimpse of the census of star formation activity in what is thought to be the heart of the reionization era. The space density of luminous galaxies has been shown to decrease by 15-20× over 4<z<8. Over this same redshift interval, the faint-end slope of the UV luminosity function becomes steeper ($\alpha$≃-2.0 at z≃7-8), revealing a dominant population of low-luminosity galaxies. Analysis of multiwavelength imaging from HST and the Spitzer Space Telescope demonstrates that z>6 UV-selected galaxies are relatively compact with blue UV continuum slopes, low stellar masses, and large specific star formation rates. In the last year, ALMA (the Atacama Large Millimeter Array) and ground-based infrared spectrographs have begun to complement this picture, revealing minimal dust obscuration and hard radiation fields, and providing evidence for metal-poor ionized gas. Weak low-ionization absorption lines suggest a patchy distribution of neutral gas surrounds O and B stars, possibly aiding in the escape of ionizing radiation. Gamma ray burst afterglows and Lyman-$\alpha$ surveys have provided evidence that the intergalactic medium (IGM) evolves from mostly ionized at z≃6-6.5 () to considerably neutral at z≃7-8 (). The reionization history that emerges from considering the UV output of galaxies over 6<z<10 is consistent with these constraints on the IGM ionization state. The latest measurements suggest that galaxies can complete reionization by z≃6 and reproduce the Thomson scattering optical depth faced by cosmic microwave background photons if the luminosity function extends ≃4 mag below current surveys and a moderate fraction () of ionizing radiation escapes from galaxies.},

abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESA star. Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M⊙ stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA star results. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

Two phase, cold and hot, gas flow will form due to thermal instability. We calculated the ratio of cold gas accretion rate to hot gas accretion rate.

We find average log(xi_ion/[Hz erg$^{-1}$])=25.06 (25.34), assuming the Calzetti (SMC) curve for the UV dust correction and a scatter of 0.28 dex in xi_ion distribution. After accounting for observational uncertainties and variations in dust attenuation, we conclude that the remaining scatter in xi_ion is likely dominated by galaxy-to-galaxy variations in stellar populations, including the slope and upper-mass cutoff of the initial mass function, stellar metallicity, star-formation burstiness, and stellar evolution (e.g., single/binary star evolution). Moreover, xi_ion is elevated in galaxies with high ionization states (high [OIII]/[OII]) and low oxygen abundances (low [NII]/H$\alpha$ and high [OIII]/H$\beta$) in the ionized ISM. However, xi_ion does not correlate with the offset from the z$\sim$0 star-forming locus in the BPT diagram, suggesting no change in the hardness of ionizing radiation accompanying the offset from the z$\sim$0 sequence. We also find that galaxies with blue UV spectral slopes ($\langle\beta\rangle$=-2.1) have elevated xi_ion by a factor of $\sim$2 relative to the average xi_ion of the sample ($\langle\beta\rangle$=-1.4). If these blue galaxies are similar to those at z > 6, our results suggest that a lower Lyman continuum escape fraction is required for galaxies to maintain reionization, compared to the canonical xi_ion predictions from stellar population models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even with robustly dust-corrected H$\alpha$, the UV dust attenuation can cause on average a $\sim$0.3dex systematic uncertainty in xi_ion calculations.},

abstract = {We have constructed merger trees for galaxies in the Illustris simulation by directly tracking the baryonic content of subhaloes. These merger trees are used to calculate the galaxy-galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellar mass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. We demonstrate that the most appropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy-galaxy merger consists in taking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reaches its maximum stellar mass. Additionally, we avoid effects from 'orphaned' galaxies by allowing some objects to 'skip' a snapshot when finding a descendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined 'infall' moment. Adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which are qualitatively similar to the halo-halo merger rate except for the last one: a strong correlation with redshift that evolves as $\sim$(1 + z)2.4-2.8, a power law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence on descendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellar masses greater than $\sim$2 × 1011M⊙. These trends are consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies (M* ≳ 1010M⊙), but in tension with some recent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies (M* ≳ 1011M⊙), which report a nearly constant or decreasing evolution with redshift. Finally, we provide a fitting function for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate which is accurate over a wide range of stellar masses, progenitor mass ratios, and redshifts.},

abstract = {Recent observations of galaxies in a cluster at z=0.35 show that their integrated gas-phase metallicities increase with decreasing cluster-centric distance. To test if ram pressure stripping (RPS) is the underlying cause, we use a semi-analytic model to quantify the "observational bias" that RPS introduces into the aperture-based metallicity measurements. We take integral field spectroscopy of local galaxies, remove gas from their outer galactic disks via RPS, and then conduct mock slit observations of cluster galaxies at z=0.35. Our RPS model predicts a typical cluster-scale metallicity gradient of -0.03 dex/Mpc. By removing gas from the outer galactic disks, RPS introduces a mean metallicity enhancement of +0.02 dex at a fixed stellar mass. This gas removal and subsequent quenching of star formation preferentially removes low mass cluster galaxies from the observed star-forming population. As only the more massive star-forming galaxies survive to reach the cluster core, RPS produces a cluster-scale stellar mass gradient of -0.05 log(M_*/M_sun)/Mpc. This mass segregation drives the predicted cluster-scale metallicity gradient of -0.03 dex/Mpc. However, the effects of RPS alone can not explain the higher metallicities measured in cluster galaxies at z=0.35. We hypothesize that additional mechanisms including steep internal metallicity gradients and self-enrichment due to gas strangulation are needed to reproduce our observations at z=0.35.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive catalog of high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with DEIMOS on the Keck II telescope for a sample of F850LP<22.43 (AB) field spheroidal (E+S0 galaxies; 165) and bulge-dominated disk (61) galaxies in the redshift range 0.2<z<1.2, selected on the basis of visual morphology from the northern field of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS-N). We discuss sample selection, photometric properties, and spectral reduction. We derive scale lengths, surface brightnesses, and photometric inhomogeneities from the ACS data and redshifts, stellar velocity dispersions, and [O II] and H$\delta$ equivalent widths from the Keck spectroscopy. Using the published 2 Ms Chandra Deep Field-North X-ray catalog, we identify active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to clarify the origin of emission lines seen in the Keck spectra. Only 2 of 13 [O II]-emitting early-type galaxies are identified as secure AGNs on the basis of their X-ray emission. Contrary to earlier suggestions, we find that most spheroidals containing ``blue cores'' are not associated with nonthermal nuclear activity. We examine the zero point, tilt, and scatter of the fundamental plane (FP) as a function of redshift and morphological properties, carefully accounting for luminosity-dependent biases via Monte Carlo simulations. The evolution of the overall FP can be represented by a mean change in effective mass-to-light ratio given by <dlog(M/LB)/dz>=-0.72+0.07-0.05+/-0.04. However, this evolution depends significantly on the dynamical mass, being slower for larger masses as reported in a previous letter. In addition, we separately show that the intrinsic scatter of the FP increases with redshift as d(rms(M/LB))/dz=0.040+/-0.015. Although these trends are consistent with single-burst populations that formed at zf>2 for high-mass spheroidals and zf$\sim$1.2 for lower mass systems, a more realistic picture is that most of the stellar mass formed in all systems at z>2 with subsequent activity continuing to lower redshifts (z<1.2). The fraction of stellar mass formed at recent times depends strongly on galactic mass, ranging from and photometric (blue cores and broadband colors) diagnostics. Via the analysis of a large sample with many independent diagnostics, we are able to reconcile previously disparate interpretations of the assembly history of field spheroidals. We discuss the implications of this measurement for the determination of the evolution of the number density of E+S0 galaxies, suggesting that number density evolution of the morphologically selected population has occurred since z$\sim$1.2.},

abstract = {We derive new self-consistent theoretical UV, optical, and IR diagnostics for the interstellar medium (ISM) pressure and electron density in the ionized nebulae of star-forming galaxies. Our UV diagnostics utilize the intercombination, forbidden, and resonance lines of silicon, carbon, aluminum, neon, and nitrogen. We also calibrate the optical and IR forbidden lines of oxygen, argon, nitrogen, and sulfur. We show that line ratios used as ISM pressure diagnostics depend on the gas-phase metallicity with a residual dependence on the ionization parameter of the gas. In addition, the traditional electron density diagnostic [S ii] $\lambda$6731/[S ii] $\lambda$6717 is strongly dependent on the gas-phase metallicity. We show how different emission-line ratios are produced in different ionization zones in our theoretical nebulae. The [S ii] and [O ii] ratios are produced in different zones and should not be used interchangeably to measure the electron density of the gas unless the electron temperature is known to be constant. We review the temperature and density distributions observed within H ii regions and discuss the implications of these distributions on measuring the electron density of the gas. Many H ii regions contain radial variations in density. We suggest that the ISM pressure is a more meaningful quantity to measure in H ii regions or galaxies. Specific combinations of line ratios can cover the full range of ISM pressures (4 < log(P/k) < 9). As H ii regions become resolved at increasingly high redshift through the next generation of telescopes, we anticipate that these diagnostics will be important for understanding the conditions around the young, hot stars from the early universe to the present day.},

As for the field, we find a decline in SFR with time, indicating that star formation (SF) was more active in the past, and a decline in SSFR as galaxy stellar mass increases, showing that the current SF contributes more to the fractional growth of low-mass galaxies than high-mass galaxies. However, we find a lower median SFR (by a factor of ∼ 1.5) in cluster star-forming galaxies than in the field. The difference is highly significant when all Spitzer and emission-line galaxies are considered, regardless of color. It remains significant at z > 0.6 after removing red emission-line galaxies, to avoid possible active galactic nucleus contamination. While there is overlap between the cluster and field SFR-mass relations, we find a population of cluster galaxies with reduced SFR for their mass. These are likely to be in transition from star forming to passive. Separately comparing clusters and groups at z > 0.6, only cluster trends are significantly different from the field, and the average cluster SFR at a given mass is ∼ two times lower than the field. We conclude that the average SFR in star-forming galaxies varies with galaxy environment at a fixed galaxy mass. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

The limited redshift range ensures that our results are insensitive to aperture bias, and to residuals from night sky emission lines. We use these measurements to trace mustar, the star formation rate normalized to Lstar, as a function of distance from the cluster centre, and local projected galaxy density. We find that the distribution of mustar steadily skews toward larger values with increasing distance from the cluster centre, converging to the field distribution at distances greater than $\sim$3 times the virial radius. A correlation between star formation rate and local projected density is also found, which is independent of cluster velocity dispersion and disappears at projected densities below $\sim$1 galaxy (brighter than M_b=-19) per Mpc^2. This characteristic scale corresponds approximately to the mean density at the cluster virial radius. The same correlation holds for galaxies more than two virial radii from the cluster centre. We conclude that environmental influences on galaxy properties are not restricted to cluster cores, but are effective in all groups where the density exceeds this critical value. The present day abundance of such systems, and the strong evolution of this abundance, makes it likely that hierarchical growth of structure plays a significant role in decreasing the global average star formation rate. Finally, the low star formation rates well beyond the virialised cluster rule out severe physical processes, such as ram pressure stripping of disk gas, as being completely responsible for the variations in galaxy properties with environment.},

abstract = {We present the new TNG50 cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulation - the third and final volume of the IllustrisTNG project. This simulation occupies a unique combination of large volume and high resolution, with a 50 Mpc box sampled by 21603 gas cells (baryon mass of 8 × 104 M☉). The median spatial resolution of star-forming interstellar medium gas is ∼100−140 pc. This resolution approaches or exceeds that of modern 'zoom' simulations of individual massive galaxies, while the volume contains ∼20 000 resolved galaxies with M* ≳ 107 M☉. Herein we show first results from TNG50, focusing on galactic outflows driven by supernovae as well as supermassive black hole feedback. We find that the outflow mass loading is a non-monotonic function of galaxy stellar mass, turning over and rising rapidly above 1010.5 M☉ due to the action of the central black hole (BH). The outflow velocity increases with stellar mass, and at fixed mass it is faster at higher redshift. The TNG model can produce high-velocity, multiphase outflows that include cool, dense components. These outflows reach speeds in excess of 3000 km s−1 out to 20 kpc with an ejective, BH-driven origin. Critically, we show how the relative simplicity of model inputs (and scalings) at the injection scale produces complex behaviour at galactic and halo scales. For example, despite isotropic wind launching, outflows exhibit natural collimation and an emergent bipolarity. Furthermore, galaxies above the star-forming main sequence drive faster outflows, although this correlation inverts at high mass with the onset of quenching, whereby low-luminosity, slowly accreting, massive BHs drive the strongest outflows.},

abstract = {We study the evolution in the number density of the highest mass galaxies over $0.4<z<1.5$ (covering 9 Gyr). We use the Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large-Area (SHELA) Survey, which covers 17.5 $\mathrm{deg}^2$ with eight photometric bands spanning 0.3-4.5 $\mu$m within the SDSS Stripe 82 field. This size produces the lowest counting uncertainties and cosmic variance yet for massive galaxies at $z\sim1.0$. We study the stellar mass function (SMF) for galaxies with $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot)>10.3$ using a forward-modeling method that fully accounts for statistical and systematic uncertainties on stellar mass. From $z$=0.4 to 1.5 the massive end of the SMF shows minimal evolution in its shape: the characteristic mass ($M^\ast$) evolves by less than 0.1 dex ($\pm$0.05 dex); the number density of galaxies with $\log (M_\ast/M_\odot) >11$ stays roughly constant at $\log (n/\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3})$ $\simeq$ $-$3.4 ($\pm$0.05), then declines to $\log (n/\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3})$=$-$3.7 ($\pm$0.05) at $z$=1.5. We discuss the uncertainties in the SMF, which are dominated by assumptions in the star formation history and details of stellar population synthesis models for stellar mass estimations. For quiescent galaxies, the data are consistent with no (or slight) evolution ($\lesssim0.1$ dex) in the characteristic mass nor number density from $z\sim 1.5$ to the present. This implies that any mass growth (presumably through "dry" mergers) of the quiescent massive galaxy population must balance the rate of mass losses from late-stage stellar evolution and the formation of quenching galaxies from the star-forming population. We provide a limit on this mass growth from $z=1.0$ to 0.4 of $\Delta M_\ast/M_\ast\leq$ 45% (i.e., $\simeq0.16$ dex) for quiescent galaxies more massive than $10^{11}$ $M_\odot$.},

abstract = {Massive galaxies in the young Universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids. Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are 'stream-fed galaxies', formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes. A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duty cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid. This stream-driven scenario for the formation of discs and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture. {\textcopyright}2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

The mean Ha half-light radius r_1/2 is about 4kpc and line emission is detected over > $\sim$20kpc in several sources. In 9 sources, we detect spatially-resolved velocity gradients, from 40 to 410 km/s over $\sim$10kpc. The observed kinematics of the larger systems are consistent with orbital motions. Four galaxies are well described by rotating disks with clumpy morphologies and we extract rotation curves out to radii > $\sim$10kpc. One or two galaxies exhibit signatures more consistent with mergers. Analyzing all 14 galaxies in the framework of rotating disks, we infer mean inclination- and beam-corrected maximum circular velocities v_c of 180+-90 km/s and dynamical masses of (0.5-25)x10^10 Msun within r_1/2. On average, the dynamical masses are consistent with photometric stellar masses assuming a Chabrier/Kroupa IMF but too small for a 0.1-100 Msun Salpeter IMF. The specific angular momenta of our BM/BX galaxies are similar to those of local late-type galaxies. The specific angular momenta of their baryons are comparable to those of their dark matter halos. Extrapolating from the average v_c at 10kpc, the virial mass of the typical halo of a galaxy in our sample is 10^(11.7+-0.5) Msun. Kinematic modeling of the 3 best cases implies a ratio of v_c to local velocity dispersion of order 2-4 and accordingly a large geometric thickness. We argue that this suggests a mass accretion (alternatively, gas exhaustion) timescale of $\sim$500Myr. We also argue that if our BM/BX galaxies were initially gas rich, their clumpy disks will subsequently lose their angular momentum and form compact bulges on a timescale of $\sim$1 Gyr. [ABRIDGED]},

abstract = {According to the current paradigm, galaxies initially form as disc galaxies at the centres of their own dark matter haloes. During their subsequent evolution, they may undergo a transformation to a red, early-type galaxy, thus giving rise to the build-up of the red sequence. Two important, outstanding questions are (i) which transformation mechanisms are most important and (ii) in what environment do they occur. In this paper, we study the impact of transformation mechanisms that operate only on satellite galaxies, such as strangulation, ram-pressure stripping and galaxy harassment. Using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we compare the colours and concentrations of satellites galaxies to those of central galaxies of the same stellar mass, adopting the hypothesis that the latter are the progenitors of the former. On average, satellite galaxies are redder and more concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass, indicating that satellite-specific transformation processes do indeed operate. Central-satellite pairs that are matched in both stellar mass and colour, however, show no average concentration difference, indicating that the transformation mechanisms operating on satellites affect colour more than morphology. We also find that the colour and concentration differences of matched central-satellite pairs are completely independent of the mass of the host halo (not to be confused with the subhalo) of the satellite galaxy, indicating that satellite-specific transformation mechanisms are equally efficient in host haloes of all masses. This strongly rules against mechanisms that are thought to operate only in very massive haloes, such as ram-pressure stripping or harassment. Instead, we argue that strangulation is the main transformation mechanism for satellite galaxies. Finally, we determine the relative importance of satellite quenching for the build-up of the red sequence. We find that roughly 70 per cent of red-sequence satellite galaxies with M * ∼ 109 h-2 M⊙ had their star formation quenched as satellites. This drops rapidly with increasing stellar mass, reaching virtually zero at M* ∼ 10 11 h-2 M⊙. Therefore, a very significant fraction of red satellite galaxies were already quenched before they became a satellite. {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent the growth phases of the supermassive black holes in the center of almost every galaxy. Powerful, highly ionized winds, with velocities ∼0.1-0.2c, are a common feature in X-ray spectra of luminous AGNs, offering a plausible physical origin for the well-known connections between the hole and properties of its host. Observability constraints suggest that the winds must be episodic and detectable only for a few percent of their lifetimes. The most powerful wind feedback, establishing the M-$\sigma$ relation, is probably not directly observable at all. The M-$\sigma$ relation signals a global change in the nature of AGN feedback. At black hole masses below M-$\sigma$, feedback is confined to the immediate vicinity of the hole. At the M-$\sigma$ mass, it becomes much more energetic and widespread and can drive away much of the bulge gas as a fast molecular outflow.},

abstract = {We introduce the first two simulations of the IllustrisTNG project, a next generation of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, focusing on the optical colors of galaxies. We explore TNG100, a rerun of the original Illustris box, and TNG300, which includes 2x2500^3 resolution elements in a volume twenty times larger. Here we present first results on the galaxy color bimodality at low redshift. Accounting for the attenuation of stellar light by dust, we compare the simulated (g-r) colors of 10^9 < M*/Msun < 10^12.5 galaxies to the observed distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation, as well as excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to the observations, with a sharp transition in median color from blue to red at a characteristic M* $\sim$ 10^10.5 Msun. Investigating the build-up of the color-mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy color transition in the TNG model is supermassive blackhole feedback in its low-accretion state. Across the entire population we measure a median color transition timescale dt_green of $\sim$1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower SFRs, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth on the red sequence. Galaxies with M* > 10^11 Msun which redden at z<1 accumulate on average $\sim$25% of their final z=0 mass post-reddening; at the same time, $\sim$18% of such massive galaxies acquire half or more of their final stellar mass while on the red sequence.},

abstract = {The growth of galaxies is a key problem in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. Galaxies grow their stellar mass by a combination of star formation and mergers, with a relative importance that is redshift dependent. Theoretical models predict quantitatively different contributions from the two channels; measuring these from the data is a crucial constraint. Exploiting the UltraVISTA catalog and a unique sample of progenitors of local ultra massive galaxies selected with an abundance matching approach, we quantify the role of the two mechanisms from z=2 to 0. We also compare our results to two independent incarnations of semi-analytic models. At all redshifts, progenitors are found in a variety of environments, ranging from being isolated to having 5-10 companions with mass ratio at least 1:10 within a projected radius of 500 kpc. In models, progenitors have a systematically larger number of companions, entailing a larger mass growth for mergers than in observations, at all redshifts. Generally, in both observations and models, the inferred and the expected mass growth roughly agree, within the uncertainties. Overall, our analysis confirms the model predictions, showing how the growth history of massive galaxies is dominated by in situ star formation at z$\sim$2, both star-formation and mergers at 1<z<2, and by mergers alone at z<1. Nonetheless, detailed comparisons still point out to tensions between the expected mass growth and our results, which might be due to either an incorrect progenitors-descendants selection, uncertainties on star formation rate and mass estimates, or the adopted assumptions on merger rates.},

abstract = {Major progress has been achieved in recent years in mapping the properties of passively-evolving, early-type galaxies (ETG) from the local universe all the way to redshift ∼2. Here, age and metallicity estimates for local cluster and field ETGs are reviewed as based on color-magnitude, color-$\sigma$, and fundamental plane relations, as well as on spectral-line indices diagnostics. The results of applying the same tools at high redshifts are then discussed, and their consistency with the low-redshift results is assessed. Most low- as well as high-redshift (z ∼ 1) observations consistently indicate (a) a formation redshift z ≳ 3 for the bulk of stars in cluster ETGs, with their counterparts in low-density environments being on average ∼1-2 Gyr younger, i.e., formed at z ≳ 1.5-2; (b) the duration of the major star-formation phase anticorrelates with galaxy mass, and the oldest stellar populations are found in the most massive galaxies. With increasing redshift there is evidence for a decrease in the number density of ETGs, especially of the less massive ones, whereas existing data appear to suggest that most of the most-massive ETGs were already fully assembled at z ∼ 1. Beyond this redshift, the space density of ETGs starts dropping significantly, and as ETGs disappear, a population of massive, strongly clustered, starburst galaxies progressively becomes more and more prominent, which makes them the likely progenitors to ETGs.

abstract = {Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient volume to make precision predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant scales. Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k $\sim$ 10 h Mpc-1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z ≃ 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109-1010 h-2Mo˙. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope $\gamma$ is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from $\gamma$ $\sim$ 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to $\gamma$ $\sim$ 1.6 at redshift z $\sim$ 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of largescale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around $\sim$5 per cent.},

Compared to typical galaxies at later times, they show more extreme emission-line properties, higher star formation rates, lower masses, and smaller sizes. However, their faintness precludes studies of their chemical abundances and ionization conditions, strongly limiting our understanding of the physics driving early galaxy build-up and metal enrichment. Here we study a rare population of UV-selected, sub$-L^{*}$(z=3) galaxies at redshift 2.4$<z<$3.5 that exhibit all the rest-frame properties expected from primeval galaxies. These low-mass, highly-compact systems are rapidly-forming galaxies able to double their stellar mass in only few tens million years. They are characterized by very blue UV spectra with weak absorption features and bright nebular emission lines, which imply hard radiation fields from young hot massive stars. Their highly-ionized gas phase has strongly sub-solar carbon and oxygen abundances, with metallicities more than a factor of two lower than that found in typical galaxies of similar mass and star formation rate at $z\lesssim$2.5. These young galaxies reveal an early and short stage in the assembly of their galactic structures and their chemical evolution, a vigorous phase which is likely to be dominated by the effects of gas-rich mergers, accretion of metal-poor gas and strong outflows.},

abstract = {The redshift of $z\sim1.5$ is the transition epoch of protoclusters (PCs) from the star-forming phase into the quenching phase, and hence an appropriate era to investigate the build up of the quenched population. We define a `core' as the most massive halo in a given PC, where environmental effects are likely to work most effectively, and search for cores at $1<z<1.5$. We use a photometric redshift catalogue of a wide (effective area of $\sim22.2\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}$) and deep ($i\sim26.8\,\mathrm{mag}$) optical survey with Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam. Regarding galaxies with $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})>11.3$ as the central galaxies of PC cores, we estimate their average halo mass by clustering analysis and find it to be $\log(M_\mathrm{h}/M_{\odot})\sim13.7$. An expected mass growth by the Illustris TNG simulation and the observed overdensities around them suggest that the PC cores we find are progenitors of present-day clusters. Classifying our galaxy sample into red and blue galaxies, we calculate the stellar mass function (SMF) and the red galaxy fraction. The SMFs in the PC cores are more-top heavy than field, implying early high-mass galaxy formation and disruption of low-mass galaxies. We also find that the red fraction increases with stellar mass, consistent with stellar-mass dependent environmental quenching recently found at $z>1$. Interestingly, although the cores with red and blue centrals have similar halo masses, only those with red centrals show a significant red fraction excess compared to the field, suggesting a conformity effect. Some observational features of PC cores may imply that the conformity is caused by assembly bias.},

We compare the SMFs for quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the highest and lowest environments using a density estimator based on the distance to the galaxies' third-nearest neighbors. For star-forming galaxies, at all redshifts there are only minor differences with environment in the shape of the SMF. For quiescent galaxies, the SMF in the lowest densities shows no evolution with redshift, other than an overall increase in number density (phi*) with time. This suggests that the stellar-mass dependence of quenching in relatively isolated galaxies is both universal and does not evolve strongly. While at z >$\sim$ 1.5 the SMF of quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable in the highest and lowest densities, at lower redshifts it shows a rapidly increasing number density of lower-mass galaxies, log M / Msun $\sim$= 9-10. We argue this evolution can account for all the redshift evolution in the shape of the total quiescent-galaxy SMF. This evolution in the quiescent-galaxy SMF at higher redshift (z > 1) requires an environmental-quenching efficiency that decreases with decreasing stellar mass at 0.5 < z < 1.5 or it would overproduce the number of lower-mass quiescent galaxies in denser environments. This requires a dominant environment process such as starvation combined with rapid gas depletion and ejection at z > 0.5 - 1.0 for galaxies in our mass range. The efficiency of this process decreases with redshift allowing other processes (such as galaxy interactions and ram-pressure stripping) to become more important at later times, z < 0.5.},

We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass Density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 10 12 M⊙ are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z ∼ 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z ∼ 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in $\Lambda$CDM.

abstract = {We have measured the equivalent width of the Ha emission line for 11 006 galaxies brighter than Mb, = -19  correlation between star formation rate and local projected density is also found, which is independent of cluster velocity dispersion and disappears at projected densities below ∼1 galaxy Mpc-2 (brighter than Mb, = -19). This characteristic scale corresponds approximately to the mean density at the cluster virial radius. The same correlation holds for galaxies more than two virial radii from the cluster centre. We conclude that environmental influences on galaxy properties are not restricted to cluster cores, but are effective in all groups where the density exceeds this critical value. The present-day abundance of such systems, and the strong evolution of this abundance, makes it likely that hierarchical growth of structure plays a significant role in decreasing the global average star formation rate. Finally, the low star formation rates well beyond the virialized cluster rule out severe physical processes, such as ram pressure stripping of disc gas, as being completely responsible for the variations in galaxy properties with environment.},

abstract = {The inflow of cosmological gas on to haloes, while challenging to directly observe and quantify, plays a fundamental role in the baryon cycle of galaxies. Using the eagle suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we present a thorough exploration of the physical properties of gas accreting on to haloes - namely, its spatial characteristics, density, temperature, and metallicity. Classifying accretion as 'hot' or "cold' based on a temperature cut-off 105.5 K, we find that the covering fraction (fcov) of cold-mode accreting gas is significantly lower than the hot-mode, with z = 0 fcov values of ${\approx}50{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ and ${\approx}80{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$, respectively. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in eagle reduces inflow fcov values by ${\approx}10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$, with outflows decreasing the solid angle available for accretion flows. Classifying inflow by particle history, we find that gas on first-infall on to a halo is metal depleted by ≈2 dex compared to pre-processed gas, which we find to mimic the circum-galactic medium (CGM) in terms of metal content. We also show that high (low) halo-scale gas accretion rates are associated with metal-poor (rich) CGM in haloes below $10^{12}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, and that variation in halo-scale gas accretion rates may offer a physical explanation for the enhanced scatter in the star-forming main sequence at low (${\lesssim}10^{9}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) and high (${\gtrsim}10^{10}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) stellar masses. Our results highlight how gas inflow influences several halo- and galaxy-scale properties, and the need to combine kinematic and chemical data in order to confidently break the degeneracy between accreting and outgoing gas in CGM observations.},

We show that the mass-weighted age of a galaxy correlates strongly with stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_*$) and ongoing star-formation (SF) activity, with the stellar content in higher-$\sigma_*$ galaxies having formed earlier and faster. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies are generally consistent with passive evolution since their main SF epoch, but a minority show clear evidence of a rejuvenation event in their recent past. The mean age of stars in galaxies that are star-forming is generally significantly younger, with SF peaking after $z<1.5$ for almost all star-forming galaxies in the sample: many of these still have either constant or rising SFRs on timescales $>100$Myrs. This indicates that $z>2$ progenitors of $z\sim1$ star-forming galaxies are generally far less massive. Finally, despite considerable variance in the individual SFHs, we show that the current SF activity of massive galaxies ($>$L$_*$) at $z\sim1$ correlates with SF levels at least $3$Gyrs prior: SFHs retain `memory' on a large fraction of the Hubble time. Our results illustrate a novel approach to resolve the formation phase of galaxies, and in identifying their individual evolutionary paths, connects progenitors and descendants across cosmic time. This is uniquely enabled by the high-quality continuum spectroscopy provided by the LEGA-C survey.},

abstract = {Satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low star formation rates (SFR) and lie on the red-sequence than central (field) galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from SDSS DR7, together with a cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star formation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of M_star > 5 x 10^9 M_sun at z=0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z$\sim$0.5, or $\sim$5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for building up all quiescent galaxies at M_star < 10^10 M_sun. We then constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of < 0.8 Gyr. These quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

abstract = {We study the effects of the local environment on the molecular gas content of a large sample of log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$) $\gtrsim$ 10 star-forming and starburst galaxies with specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) on and above the main-sequence (MS) to $z$ $\sim$ 3.5. ALMA observations of the dust continuum in the COSMOS field are used to estimate molecular gas masses at $z$ $\approx$ 0.5-3.5. We also use a local universe sample from the ALFALFA HI survey after converting it to molecular masses. The molecular mass ($M_{ISM}$) scaling relation shows a dependence on $z$, $M_{*}$, and sSFR relative to the MS, but no dependence on environmental overdensity $\Delta$ ($M_{ISM}$ $\propto$ $\Delta^{0.03}$). Similarly, gas mass fraction (f$_{gas}$) and depletion timescale ($\tau$) show no environmental dependence to $z$ $\sim$ 3.5. At $\langle z\rangle$ $\sim$ 1.8, the average $\langle M_{ISM}\rangle$,$\langle$f$_{gas}\rangle$, and $\langle \tau \rangle$ in densest regions is (1.6$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$, 55$\pm$2%, and 0.8$\pm$0.1 Gyr, respectively, similar to those in the lowest density bin. Independent of the environment, f$_{gas}$ decreases and $\tau$ increases with increasing cosmic time. Cosmic molecular mass density ($\rho$) in the lowest density bins peaks at $z$ $\sim$ 1-2 and this peak happens at $z$ $<$ 1 in densest bins. This differential evolution of $\rho$ across environments is likely due to the growth of the large-scale structure with cosmic time. Our results suggest that the molecular gas content and the subsequent star-formation activity of log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$) $\gtrsim$ 10 star-forming and starburst galaxies is primarily driven by internal processes, not their local environment since $z$ $\sim$ 3.5},

The survey includes high resolution HI data of 53 carefully selected late type galaxies (48 spirals and 5 irregular systems). The goal is to study environmental effects on HI gas properties of cluster galaxies to understand which physical mechanisms affect galaxy evolution in different density regions, and to establish how far out the impact of the cluster reaches. As a dynamically young cluster, Virgo contains examples of galaxies experiencing a variety of environmental effects. Its nearness allows us to study each galaxy in great detail. We have selected Virgo galaxies with a range of star formation properties in low to high density regions (at the projected distance from M87, d_87=0.3-3.3 Mpc). Contrary to pr evious studies, more than half of the galaxies in the samplee, systemic velocity, subcluster membership, HI mass and deficiency.

abstract = {Fitting synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to the multiband photometry of galaxies to derive their star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses, ages, etc. requires making a priori assumptions about their star formation histories (SFHs). A widely adopted parametrization of the SFH, the so-called $\tau$ models where SFR ∝ e-t/$\tau$ is shown to lead to unrealistically low ages when applied to a sample of actively star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2, a problem shared by other SFHs when the age is left as a free parameter in the fitting procedure. This happens because the SED of such galaxies, at all wavelengths, is dominated by their youngest stellar populations, which outshine the older ones. Thus, the SED of such galaxies conveys little information on the beginning of star formation (SF), i.e. on the age of their oldest stellar populations. To cope with this problem, besides $\tau$ models (hereafter called direct-$\tau$ models), we explore a variety of SFHs, such as constant SFR and inverted-$\tau$ models (with SFR ∝ e+t/$\tau$), along with various priors on age, including assuming that SF started at high redshift in all the galaxies in the test sample. We find that inverted-$\tau$ models with such latter assumption give SFRs and extinctions in excellent agreement with the values derived using only the UV part of the SED, which is the one most sensitive to ongoing SF and reddening. These models are also shown to accurately recover the SFRs and masses of mock galaxies at z ∼ 2 constructed from semi-analytic models, which we use as a further test. All other explored SFH templates do not fulfil these two tests as well as inverted-$\tau$ models do. In particular, direct-$\tau$ models with unconstrained age in the fitting procedure overestimate SFRs and underestimate stellar mass, and would exacerbate an apparent mismatch between the cosmic evolution of the volume densities of SFR and stellar mass. We conclude that for high-redshift star-forming galaxies an exponentially increasing SFR with a high formation redshift is preferable to other forms of the SFH so far adopted in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Using the fossil record method implemented through Pipe3D, we reconstruct the global and radial stellar mass growth histories (MGHs) of a large sample of galaxies, ranging from dwarf to giant objects, from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. We confirm that the main driver of the global MGHs is mass, with more massive galaxies assembling earlier (downsizing), though for a given mass, the global MGHs segregate by colour, specific star formation rate and morphological type. From the inferred radial mean MGHs, we find that at fractions of assembled mass larger than $\sim$80 per cent, the innermost regions formed stars, on average, in the inside-out mode. At earlier epochs, when the age estimation of the method becomes poor, the MGHs seem to be spatially homogeneous or even in the outside-in mode, especially for the red/quiescent/early-type galaxies. The innermost MGHs are, in general, less scattered around the mean than the outermost MGHs. For dwarf and low-mass galaxies, we do not find evidence of an outside-in formation mode; instead, their radial MGHs are very diverse most of the time, with periods of outside-in and inside-out modes (or strong radial migration), suggesting this is an episodic star formation history. Blue/star-forming/late-type galaxies present, on average, a significantly more pronounced inside-out formation mode than red/quiescent/early-type galaxies, independently of mass. We discuss our results in the light of the processes of galaxy formation, quenching and radial migration. We also discuss the uncertainties and biases of the fossil record method and how these could affect our results.},

We further obtained 649 SDSS spectra of these objects, and visually identified 22 [OIII] emitters lying at 0.40 $<$ z $<$ 0.63. Having constructed their UV-IR spectral energy distributions (SED) we found that they have fairly blue r-W2 and red W1-W4 colors, indicative of strong warm dust emission. Their rest-frame [OIII]$\lambda$5007 equivalent widths are mostly 200-600 \AA, and their high [OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ ratios put them at the boundary of star-forming galaxies and AGNs on line ratio classification diagrams. The typical E(B-V) and electron temperature of [OIII] emitters are $\sim$ 0.1-0.3 mag and $\sim$ 10$^4$ K, respectively. The lowest metallicity of our [OIII] emitters with S/N$_{\rm [OIII]\lambda4363}$ $>$ 3 is 12 + log(O/H) = 7.98$^{+0.12}_{-0.02}$, with a median value of 8.24$^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$.

abstract = {The ionizing photon production efficiency, $\xi_{ion}$, is a critical parameter that provides a number of physical constraints to the nature of the early Universe, including the contribution of galaxies to the timely completion of the reionization of the Universe. Here we use KECK/MOSFIRE and ZFOURGE multi-band photometric data to explore the $\xi_{ion}$ of a population of galaxies at $z\sim2$ with $log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot)\sim9.0-11.5$. Our 130 \Halpha\ detections show a median $log_{10}(\xi_{ion}[Hz/erg])$ of $24.8\pm0.5$ when dust corrected using a Calzetti et al. (2000) dust prescription. Our values are typical of mass/magnitude selected $\xi_{ion}$ values observed in the $z\sim2$ Universe. Using BPASSv2.2.1 and Starburst99 stellar population models with simple parametric star-formation-histories (SFH), we find that even with models that account for effects of stellar evolution with binaries/stellar rotation, model galaxies at $log_{10}(\xi_{ion}[Hz/erg])\lesssim25.0$ have low H$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW) and redder colors compared to our $z\sim2$ observed sample. We find that introducing star-bursts to the SFHs resolve the tension with the models, however, due to the rapid time evolution of $\xi_{ion}$, H$\alpha$ EWs, and rest-frame optical colors, our Monte Carlo simulations of star-bursts show that random distribution of star-bursts in evolutionary time of galaxies are unlikely to explain the observed distribution. Thus, either our observed sample is specially selected based on their past SFH or stellar models require additional mechanisms to reproduce the observed high UV luminosity of galaxies for a given production rate of hydrogen ionizing photons.},

abstract = {We present an overview of galaxy evolution across cosmic time in the Illustris simulation. Illustris is an N-body/hydrodynamical simulation that evolves 2 × 18203 resolution elements in a (106.5Mpc)3 box from cosmological initial conditions down to z = 0 using the AREPO moving-mesh code. The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z = 0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z = 7 to 0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z = 4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their haloes for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star formation rates up to z = 8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z = 5 to 0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in Hubble Space Telescope mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z = 2 to their z = 0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z = 0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star formation activity and compactness. We conclude with a discussion of several disagreements with observations, and lay out possible directions for future research.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies at z ∼ 2 are in a quiescent phase. Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of ∼ 1 kpc. We have obtained a ∼ 29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z = 2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z > 2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 M⊙ yr-1, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ∼ 2 × 1011 M⊙. We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [N II]/H$\alpha$, [S II]/H$\alpha$, and [O II]/[O III] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR isthese objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes ≲ size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up ≲ 1ertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

abstract = {Using a large (14 857), homogenously selected sample of cluster galaxies identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4, we investigate the impact of cluster membership and local density on the stellar mass-gas phase metallicity relation (MZR). We show that stellar metallicities are not suitable for this work, being relatively insensitive to subtle changes in the MZR. Accurate nebular abundances can be obtained for 1318 cluster galaxies in our sample and we show that these galaxies are drawn from clusters that are fully representative of the parent sample in terms of mass, size, velocity dispersion and richness. By comparing the MZR of the cluster galaxies with a sample of control galaxies matched in mass, redshift, fibre covering fraction and rest-frame g - r colour cluster galaxies are found to have, on average, higher metallicities by up to 0.04 dex. The magnitude of this offset does not depend strongly on galactic half-light radius or cluster properties such as velocity dispersion or cluster mass. The effect of local density on the MZR is investigated, using the presence of a near neighbour and both two- and three-dimensional density estimators. For all three metrics, it is found that the cluster galaxies in locally rich environments have higher median metallicities by up to ∼0.05 dex than those in locally poor environments (or without a near neighbour). Control (non-cluster) galaxies at locally high densities exhibit similar metal enhancements. Taken together, these results show that galaxies in clusters are, on average, slightly more metal rich than the field, but that this effect is driven by local overdensity and not simply cluster membership. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {We use our state-of-the-art Galaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytic model to study how and on which time-scales star formation is suppressed in satellite galaxies. Our fiducial stellar feedback model, implementing strong stellar driven outflows, reproduces relatively well the variations of passive fractions as a function of galaxy stellar mass and halo mass measured in the local Universe, as well as the ‘quenching' time-scales inferred from the data. We show that the same level of agreement can be obtained by using an alternative stellar feedback scheme featuring lower ejection rates at high redshift, and modifying the treatment for hot gas stripping. This scheme overpredicts the number densities of low-to-intermediate mass galaxies. In addition, a good agreement with the observed passive fractions can be obtained only by assuming that cooling can continue on satellites, at the rate predicted considering halo properties at infall, even after their parent dark matter substructure is stripped below the resolution of the simulation. For our fiducial model, the better agreement with the observed passive fractions can be ascribed to: (i) a larger cold gas fraction of satellites at the time of accretion, and (ii) a lower rate of gas reheating by supernovae explosions and stellar winds with respect to previous versions of our model. Our results suggest that the abundance of passive galaxies with stellar mass larger than ∼1010 M is primarily determined by the self-regulation between star formation and stellar feedback, with environmental processes playing a more marginal role.},

abstract = {The study of cluster post starburst galaxies gives useful insights on the physical processes quenching the star formation in the most massive environments. Exploiting the MUSE data of the GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies (GASP) project, we characterise the quenching history of 8 local cluster galaxies that were selected for not showing emission lines in their fiber spectra. We inspect the integrated colors, the Hb rest frame equivalent widths (EW), star formation histories (SFHs) and luminosity-weighted age (LWA) maps finding no signs of current star formation throughout the disks of these early-spiral/S0 galaxies. All of them have been passive for at least 20 Myr, but their SF declined on different timescales. In most of them the outskirts reached undetectable SFRs before the inner regions (outside-in quenching). Our sample includes three post-starforming galaxies, two passive galaxies and three galaxies with intermediate properties. The first population shows blue colors, deep Hb in absorption (EW>>2.8A), young ages (8.8<log(LW [yr])<9.2). Two of these galaxies show signs of a central SF enhancement before quenching. Passive galaxies have instead red colors, EW(Hb)<2.8A, ages in the range 9.2<log(LWA[yr])<10. Finally, the other galaxies are most likely in transition between a post starforming and passive phase, as they quenched in an intermediate epoch and have not lost all the star forming features yet. The outside-in quenching, the morphology and kinematics of the stellar component, along with the position of these galaxies within massive clusters (sigma_cl=550-950km/s) point to a scenario in which ram pressure stripping has removed the gas, leading to quenching. Only the three most massive galaxies might alternatively have entered the clusters already quenched. These galaxies are therefore at the final stage of the rapid evolution galaxies undergo when they enter the clusters.},

Besides exploring early structure formation, searching for protoclusters at even higher redshifts is particularly useful to probe the reionization. Here we report the discovery of the protocluster LAGER-z7OD1 at a redshift of 6.93, when the Universe was only 770 million years old and could be experiencing rapid evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium7,8. The protocluster is identified by an overdensity of 6 times the average galaxy density, and with 21 narrowband selected Lyman-$\alpha$ galaxies, among which 16 have been spectroscopically confirmed. At redshifts similar to or above this record, smaller protogroups with fewer members have been reported9,10. LAGER-z7OD1 shows an elongated shape and consists of two subprotoclusters, which would have merged into one massive cluster with a present-day mass of 3.7 × 1015 solar masses. The total volume of the ionized bubbles generated by its member galaxies is found to be comparable to the volume of the protocluster itself, indicating that we are witnessing the merging of the individual bubbles and that the intergalactic medium within the protocluster is almost fully ionized. LAGER-z7OD1 thus provides a unique natural laboratory to investigate the reionization process.},

We examine how the equivalent widths of [OII]$\lambda\lambda 3727, 3730$, H$\beta$, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda 4960, 5008$, [OIII]$+$H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, and H$\alpha$+[NII]$\lambda\lambda 6550, 6585$, depend on stellar mass, UV slope, age, star-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR), ionization parameter and excitation conditions (O32 and [OIII]/H$\beta$), gas-phase metallicity, and ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$). The trend of increasing $W$ with decreasing stellar mass is strongest for [OIII] (and [OIII]+H$\beta$). More generally, the equivalent widths of all the lines increase with redshift at a fixed stellar mass or fixed gas-phase metallicity, suggesting that high equivalent width galaxies are common at high redshift. This redshift evolution in equivalent widths can be explained by the increase in SFR and decrease in metallicity with redshift at a fixed stellar mass. Consequently, the dependence of $W$ on sSFR is largely invariant with redshift, particularly when examined for galaxies of a given metallicity. Our results show that high equivalent width galaxies, specifically those with high $W({\rm [OIII]})$, have low stellar masses, blue UV slopes, young ages, high sSFRs, ISM line ratios indicative of high ionization parameters, high $\xi_{\rm ion}$, and low metallicities. As these characteristics are often attributed to galaxies with high ionizing escape fractions, galaxies with high $W$ are likely candidates for the population that dominates cosmic reionization.},

We mask out spaxels contaminated by non-stellar emission using the [O III]/H $\beta$, [NII]/H $\alpha$, [S II]/H $\alpha$, and [O I]/H $\alpha$ line ratios. Using thesemaps, we examine the global and resolved starforming main sequences of SAMI galaxies as a function of morphology, environmental density, and stellar mass. Galaxies further below the star-forming main sequence are more likely to have flatter star formation profiles. Early-type galaxies split into two populations with similar stellar masses and central stellar mass surface densities. The main-sequence population has centrally concentrated star formation similar to late-type galaxies, while galaxies > 3$\sigma$ below the main sequence show significantly reduced star formation most strikingly in the nuclear regions. The split populations support a two-step quenching mechanism, wherein halo mass first cuts off the gas supply and remaining gas continues to form stars until the local stellar mass surface density can stabilize the reduced remaining fuel against further star formation. Across all morphologies, galaxies in denser environments show a decreased specific star formation rate from the outside in, supporting an environmental cause for quenching, such as ram-pressure stripping or galaxy interactions.},

abstract = {The inefficiency of star formation in massive elliptical galaxies is widely believed to be caused by the interactions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with the surrounding gas. Achieving a sufficiently rapid reddening of moderately massive galaxies without expelling too many baryons has however proven difficult for hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, prompting us to explore a new model for the accretion and feedback effects of supermassive black holes. For high-accretion rates relative to the Eddington limit, we assume that a fraction of the accreted rest mass energy heats the surrounding gas thermally, similar to the 'quasar mode' in previouswork. For low-accretion rates, we invoke a new, pure kinetic feedback model that imparts momentum to the surrounding gas in a stochastic manner. These two modes of feedback are motivated both by theoretical conjectures for the existence of different types of accretion flows as well as recent observational evidence for the importance of kinetic AGN winds in quenching galaxies.We find that a large fraction of the injected kinetic energy in this mode thermalizes via shocks in the surrounding gas, thereby providing a distributed heating channel. In cosmological simulations, the resulting model produces red, non-star-forming massive elliptical galaxies, and achieves realistic gas fractions, black hole growth histories and thermodynamic profiles in large haloes.},

Massive galaxies at z {\textgreater} 3 have either a flat or declining star formation history (SFH), whereas similar stellar mass galaxies at z{\$\sim${}}2.0 exhibit a slight peak in the past 500 Myrs. Comparing with the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, we find that (i) the dynamical mass of massive galaxies in simulations (log(M{\_}star) {\textgreater} 10.0) increases by {\$\sim${}}0.1 dex at a fixed stellar mass between z=2.0-3.0, and (ii) dynamical mass growth is coupled with a rapid rise in the ex-situ stellar mass fraction (stars accreted from other galaxies) for massive galaxies at z {\textless} 3.5. We speculate that the rising contribution of ex-situ stellar mass to the total stellar mass growth of massive galaxies is driving the higher integrated velocity dispersion and rising SFHs of massive galaxies at z{\$\sim${}}2.0 compared to galaxies of similar stellar masses at z {\textgreater} 3.},

abstract = {The Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) for the Cassegrain focus of the Keck 10-meter telescope on Mauna Kea is described. It has an imaging mode so it can also be used for taking direct images. The field of view in both spectrographic and imaging modes is 6 by 7.8 arcmin. It can be used with both conventional slits and custom-punched slit masks. The optical quality of the spectrograph is good enough to take full advantage of the excellent imaging properties of the telescope itself. The detector is a cooled back-illuminated Tektronics Inc. 2048 CCD which gives a sampling rate of 4.685 pixels per arcsec. In the spectrographic mode the spectrograph has a maximum efficiency at the peak of the grating blaze of 32-34% for the two lowest resolution gratings and 28% for the 1200 g/mm grating. This efficiency includes the detector but not the telescope or the atmosphere. (SECTION: Astronomical Instrumentation)},

abstract = {We present the first direct calibration of strong-line metallicity diagnostics at significant cosmological distances using a sample at z=0.8 drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. Oxygen and neon abundances are derived from measurements of electron temperature and density. We directly compare various commonly used relations between gas-phase metallicity and strong line ratios of O, Ne, and H at z=0.8 and z=0. There is no evolution with redshift at high precision ($\Delta \log{\mathrm{O/H}} = -0.01\pm0.03$, $\Delta \log{\mathrm{Ne/O}} = 0.01 \pm 0.01$). O, Ne, and H line ratios follow the same locus at z=0.8 as at z=0 with $\lesssim$0.02 dex evolution and low scatter ($\lesssim$0.04 dex). This suggests little or no evolution in physical conditions of HII regions at fixed oxygen abundance, in contrast to models which invoke more extreme properties at high redshifts. We speculate that offsets observed in the [N II]/H$\alpha$ versus [O III]/H$\beta$ diagram at high redshift are therefore due to [NII] emission, likely as a result of relatively high N/O abundance. If this is indeed the case, then nitrogen-based metallicity diagnostics suffer from systematic errors at high redshift. Our findings indicate that locally calibrated abundance diagnostics based on alpha-capture elements can be reliably applied at z$\simeq$1 and possibly at much higher redshifts. This constitutes the first firm basis for the widespread use of empirical calibrations in high redshift metallicity studies.},

abstract = {We present rest-frame optical images and spectra of the gravitationally lensed, star-forming galaxy J0900+2234 (z = 2.03). The observations were performed with the newly commissioned LUCIFER1 near-infrared (NIR) instrument mounted on the Large Binocular Telescope. We fitted lens models to the rest-frame optical images and found that the galaxy has an intrinsic effective radius of 7.4 ± 0.8 kpc with a lens magnification factor of about 5 for the A and B components. We also discovered a new arc belonging to another lensed high-z source galaxy, which makes this lens system a potential double Einstein ring system. Using the high signalto-noise ratio rest-frame spectra covered by the H+ K band, we detected H$\beta$, [O iii], H$\alpha$, [N ii], and [S ii] emission lines. Detailed physical properties of this high-z galaxy were derived. The extinction toward the ionized H ii regions (Eg(B -V )) was computed from the flux ratio of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ and appears to be much higher than that toward the stellar continuum (Es (B -V )), derived from the optical and NIR broadband photometry fitting. The metallicity was estimated using N2 and O3N2 indices. It is in the range of 1/5 -1/3 solar abundance, which is much lower than for typical z ∼ 2 star-forming galaxies. From the flux ratio of [S ii]$\lambda$6717 and [S ii]$\lambda$6732, we found that the electron number density of the H ii regions in the high-z galaxy was ≃1000 cm-3, consistent with other z ∼ 2 galaxies butmuch higher than that in local H ii regions. The star formation rate was estimated via the H$\alpha$ luminosity, after correction for the lens magnification, to be about 365±69M⊙ yr-1. Combining the FWHM of H$\alpha$ emission lines and the half-light radius, we found that the dynamical mass of the lensed galaxy is (5.8 ± 0.9) × 1010M ⊙. The gas mass is (5.1 ± 1.1) × 10 10M⊙ from the H$\alpha$ flux surface density using global Kennicutt-Schmidt law, indicating a very high gas fraction of 0.79 ± 0.19 in J0900+2234. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {We point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation in early-type galaxies (ETGs). It automatically links the color of a galaxy with its morphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas supply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for instance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ) using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique. We show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient to stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an ETG red and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the absence of bound star-forming clumps. While other quenching mechanisms, such as gas stripping, active galactic nucleus feedback, virial shock heating, and gravitational heating are limited to massive halos, MQ can explain the appearance of red ETGs also in halos less massive than ∼ 1012 M ⊙. The dense gas disks observed in some of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas red galaxies with quenched gas disks could be more frequent at high redshift. {\textcopyright} 2009.

For these quiescent galaxies we find a rather abrupt change in p(b/a) at a stellar mass of $\sim$10^{11} M_sol: at higher masses there are hardly any galaxies with b/a<0.6, implying that essentially none of them have disk-like intrinsic shapes and must be spheroidal. This transition mass is $\sim$3-4 times higher than the threshold mass above which quiescent galaxies dominate in number over star-forming galaxies, which suggests these mass scales are unrelated. At masses lower than $\sim$10^{11} M_sol, quiescent galaxies show a large range in axial ratios, implying a mix of bulge- and disk-dominated galaxies. Our result strongly suggests that major merging is the most important, and perhaps only relevant, evolutionary channel to produce massive (>10^{11} M_sol), quiescent galaxies, as it inevitably results in spheroids.},

The source extraction and analysis is based on the new ProFound image analysis package, providing matched-segment photometry across all bands. The data are classified into stars, galaxies, artefacts, and ambiguous objects, and objects are linked to the GAMA spectroscopic target catalogue. Additionally, a new technique is employed utilising ProFound to extract photometry in the unresolved MIR-FIR regime. The catalogues including the full FUV-FIR photometry are described and will be fully available as part of GAMA DR4. They are intended for both standalone science, selection for targeted follow-up with 4MOST, as well as an accompaniment to the upcoming and ongoing radio arrays now studying the GAMA 23h field.},

MaNGA will investigate the internal kinematic structure and composition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies. We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in diameter from 12″ (19 fibers) to 32″ (127 fibers). Two dual-channel spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 A˚ at R ∼ 2000.With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r-band signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (A˚-1 per 2″ fiber) at 23 AB mag arcsec-2, which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies. Targets are selected with M∗ ≳ 109 M⊙ using SDSS-I redshifts and i-band luminosity to achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, an approximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a wide range of environments. Analysis of our prototype observations demonstrates MaNGA's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formation and quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, and map the composition of stellar populations.MaNGA's spatially resolved spectra will enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies in the coming 6 yr.},

abstract = {Mergers and the spin of the dark matter halo are factors traditionally believed to determine the morphology of galaxies within a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. We study this hypothesis by considering approximately 18 000 central galaxies at z = 0 with stellar masses M∗ = 109-1012 M☉ selected from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. The fraction of accreted stars - which measures the importance of massive, recent and dry mergers - increases steeply with galaxy stellar mass, from less than 5 per cent in dwarfs to 80 per cent in the most massive objects, and the impact of mergers on galaxy morphology increases accordingly. For galaxies with M∗ ≿ 1011 M☉, mergers have the expected effect: If gas-poor, they promote the formation of spheroidal galaxies, whereas gas-rich mergers favour the formation and survivability of massive discs. This trend, however, breaks at lower masses. For objects with M∗ ≾ 1011 M☉, mergers do not seem to play any significant role in determining the morphology, with accreted stellar fractions and mean merger gas fractions that are indistinguishable between spheroidal and disc-dominated galaxies. On the other hand, halo spin correlates with morphology primarily in the least massive objects in the sample (M∗ ≾ 1010 M☉), but only weakly for galaxies above that mass. Our results support a scenario where (1) mergers play a dominant role in shaping the morphology of massive galaxies, (2) halo spin is important for the morphology of dwarfs, and (3) the morphology of medium-sized galaxies - including the Milky Way - shows little dependence on galaxy assembly history or halo spin, at least when these two factors are considered individually.},

The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3, has a dark mass resolution of 6.26 × 106M⊙, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 × 106M⊙. At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 × 18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: Primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

abstract = {Aims. We study the star formation fistory (SFH) of 210 galaxy members of 55 Hickson compact groups (HCG) and 309 galaxies from the Catalog of Isolated Galaxies (CIG). The SFH traces the variation of star formation over the lifetime of a galaxy, and consequently yields a snapshot picture of its formation. Comparing the SFHs in these extremes in galaxy density allows us to determine the main effects of compact groups (CG) on the formation of galaxies. Methods. We fit our spectra using the spectral synthesis code STARLIGHT and obtained the stellar population contents and mean stellar ages of HCG and CIG galaxies in three different morphological classes: early-type galaxies (EtG), early-type spirals (EtS), and late-type spirals (LtS). Results. We find that EtG and EtS galaxies in HCG show higher contents of old and intermediate stellar populations as well as an important deficit of the young stellar population, which clearly implies an older average stellar age in early galaxies in HCG. For LtS galaxies we find similar mean values for the stellar content and age in the two samples. However, we note that LtS can be split into two subclasses, namely old and young LtS. In HCG we find a higher fraction of young LtS than in the CIG sample, in addition, most of these galaxies belong to groups in which most of the galaxies are also young and actively forming stars. The specific star formation rate (SSFR) of spiral galaxies in the two samples differ. The EtS in HCG show lower SSFR values, while LtS peak at higher values compared with their counterparts in isolation. We also measured the shorter star formation time scale (SFTS) in HCG galaxies, which indicates that they have a shorter star formation activity than CIG galaxies. We take these observations as evidence that galaxies in CG have evolved more rapidly than galaxies in isolation, regardless of their morphology. Our observations are consistent with the hierarchical galaxy formation model, which states that CGs are structures that formed recently from primordial small-mass density fluctuations. From the systematic difference in SFTS we deduce that the HCG have most probably formed $\sim$ 3 Gyr in the past.

Our sample consists of 75 Ks-band selected star-forming galaxies from the ZFOURGE survey with stellar masses ranging from log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$=9.0-11.0$, 28 of which are members of a known overdensity at $z=2.095$. We measure H$\alpha$ emission-line integrated velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm int}$) from 50$-$230 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with other emission-line studies of $z\sim2$ field galaxies. From these data we estimate virial, stellar, and gas masses and derive correlations between these properties for cluster and field galaxies at $z\sim2$. We find evidence that baryons dominate within the central effective radius. However, we find no statistically significant differences between the cluster and the field, and conclude that the kinematics of star-forming galaxies at $z\sim2$ are not significantly different between the cluster and field environments.},

This model has previously been shown to reproduce the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (SFR-M∗) over the same interval, is fully consistent with the observed evolution of the cosmic SFR density at z ≤ 8, and entails no explicit "quenching" prescription. We interpret these results/features in the context of other models demonstrating a similar ability to reproduce the evolution of (1) the cosmic SFR density, (2) the total/quiescent stellar mass functions, and (3) the SFR-M∗ relation, proposing that the key difference between modeling approaches is the extent to which they stress/address diversity in the (star-forming) galaxy population.

For the remaining three pairs, we were unable to obtain redshifts of both constituent galaxies. To identify a more objective sample of merging systems, we select bound red galaxy pairs (R_s<=30 kpc, dv<=300 km/s) from our sample of 121 confirmed cluster members: galaxies in bound red pairs make up 15.7+/-3.6 color-magnitude diagram shows that the pair galaxies are as red as the E/S0 members and have a homogeneous stellar population. The red pair galaxies span a large range in luminosity and internal velocity dispersion to include some of the brightest, most massive members (L>L*, sigma>200 km/s); these bound galaxy pairs must evolve into E/S0 members by z$\sim$0.7. These results combined with MS1054's high merger fraction and reservoir of likely future mergers indicates that most, if not all, of its early-type members evolved from (passive) galaxy-galaxy mergers at z<$\sim$1.},

abstract = {The difference in shape between the observed galaxy stellar mass function and the predicted dark matter halo mass function is generally explained primarily by feedback processes. Feedback can shape the stellar-halo mass (SHM) relation by driving gas out of galaxies, by modulating the first-time infall of gas onto galaxies (i.e., preventative feedback), and by instigating fountain flows of recycled wind material. We present and apply a method to disentangle these effects for hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. We build a model of linear coupled differential equations that by construction reproduces the flows of gas onto and out of galaxies and haloes in the EAGLE cosmological simulation. By varying individual terms in this model, we isolate the relative effects of star formation, ejection via outflow, first-time inflow and wind recycling on the SHM relation. We find that for halo masses $M_{200} < 10^{12} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ the SHM relation is shaped primarily by a combination of ejection from galaxies and haloes, while for larger $M_{200}$ preventative feedback is also important. The effects of recycling and the efficiency of star formation are small. We show that if, instead of $M_{200}$, we use the cumulative mass of dark matter that fell in for the first time, the evolution of the SHM relation nearly vanishes. This suggests that the evolution is due to the definition of halo mass rather than to an evolving physical efficiency of galaxy formation. Finally, we demonstrate that the mass in the circum-galactic medium is much more sensitive to gas flows, especially recycling, than is the case for stars and the interstellar medium.},

abstract = {A recent survey of the Galaxy and M31 reveals that more than 90{\%} of dwarf galaxies within 270 kpc of their host galaxy are deficient in H I gas. At such an extreme radius, the coronal halo gas is an order of magnitude too low to remove H I gas through ram pressure stripping for any reasonable orbit distribution. However, all dwarfs are known to have an ancient stellar population (gsim 10 Gyr) from early epochs of vigorous star formation which, through heating of H I, could allow the hot halo to remove this gas. Our model looks at the evolution of these dwarf galaxies analytically as the host-galaxy dark matter halo and coronal halo gas build up over cosmic time. The dwarf galaxies—treated as spherically symmetric, smooth distributions of dark matter and gas—experience early star formation, which sufficiently heats the gas, allowing it to be removed easily through tidal stripping by the host galaxy, or ram pressure stripping by a tenuous hot halo (n H = 3 × 10-4 cm-3 at 50 kpc). This model of evolution is able to explain the observed radial distribution of gas-deficient and gas-rich dwarfs around the Galaxy and M31 if the dwarfs fell in at high redshift },

We spectroscopically confirm the presence of a large galaxy filament ($\sim$ 8 Mpc), along which five confirmed X-ray groups exist. We show that within the uncertainties, the ionization parameter, equivalent width (EW), EW versus specific star-formation rate (sSFR) relation, EW versus stellar mass relation, line-of-sight velocity dispersion, dynamical mass, and stellar-to-dynamical mass ratio are similar for filament and field star-forming galaxies. However, we show that on average, filament star-forming galaxies are more metal-enriched ($\sim$ 0.1$-$0.15 dex), possibly due to the inflow of the already enriched intrafilamentary gas into filament galaxies. Moreover, we show that electron densities are significantly lower (a factor of $\sim$17) in filament star-forming systems compared to those in the field, possibly because of a longer star-formation timescale for filament star-forming galaxies. Our results highlight the potential pre-processing role of galaxy filaments and intermediate-density environments on the evolution of galaxies, which has been highly underestimated.},

abstract = {We use the chemical evolution predictions of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with our latest theoretical stellar population synthesis, photoionization and shock models to predict the strong line evolution of ensembles of galaxies from z=3 to the present day. In this paper, we focus on the brightest optical emission-line ratios, [NII]/H-alpha and [OIII]/H-beta. We use the optical diagnostic Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram as a tool for investigating the spectral properties of ensembles of active galaxies. We use four redshift windows chosen to exploit new near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We predict how the BPT diagram will appear in these four redshift windows given different sets of assumptions. We show that the position of star-forming galaxies on the BPT diagram traces the ISM conditions and radiation field in galaxies at a given redshift. Galaxies containing AGN form a mixing sequence with purely star-forming galaxies. This mixing sequence may change dramatically with cosmic time, due to the metallicity sensitivity of the optical emission-lines. Furthermore, the position of the mixing sequence may probe metallicity gradients in galaxies as a function of redshift, depending on the size of the AGN narrow line region. We apply our latest slow shock models for gas shocked by galactic-scale winds. We show that at high redshift, galactic wind shocks are clearly separated from AGN in line ratio space. Instead, shocks from galactic winds mimic high metallicity starburst galaxies. We discuss our models in the context of future large near-infrared spectroscopic surveys.},

abstract = {We present the first detailed dissection of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of massive starburst galaxies at z > 2. Our target is a submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z = 2.674 that has a star formation rate of 1200 $M_\odot$/yr and a molecular gas reservoir of $1.3\times10^{11} M_\odot$. We characterize its CGM with two background QSOs at impact parameters of 93 kpc and 176 kpc. We detect strong HI and metal-line absorption near the redshift of the SMG towards both QSOs, each consisting of three main subsystems spanning over 1500 km/s. The absorbers show remarkable kinematic and metallicity coherence across a separation of 86 kpc. In particular, the cool gas in the CGM of the SMG exhibits high HI column densities ($\log N_{\rm HI}/{\rm cm}^{-2} = 20.2, 18.6$), low metallicities ([M/H] $\approx$ -2.0), and similar radial velocities ($\approx$ -300 km/s). While the HI column densities match previous results on the CGM around QSOs at z > 2, the metallicities are lower by more than an order of magnitude, making it an outlier in the line width$-$metallicity relation of damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers. The large physical extent, the velocity coherence, the high surface density, and the low metallicity are all consistent with the cool, inflowing, and near-pristine gas streams predicted to penetrate hot massive halos at z > 1.5. We estimate a total gas accretion rate of $\sim$100 $M_\odot$/yr from three such streams, which falls short of the star formation rate but is consistent with simulations. At this rate, it takes about a gigayear to acquire the molecular gas reservoir of the central starburst.},

These galaxies satisfy strict pure star-forming selection criteria to avoid contamination from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or strong shocks/outflows. Using the relatively high spatial and spectral resolution of SAMI, we find that - on sub-kpc scales, our galaxies display a flat distribution of ionized gas velocity dispersion as a function of star formation rate (SFR) surface density. A major fraction of our SAMI galaxies shows higher velocity dispersion than predictions by feedback-driven models, especially at the low SFR surface density end. Our results suggest that additional sources beyond star formation feedback contribute to driving random motions of the interstellar medium in star-forming galaxies.We speculate that gravity, galactic shear and/or magnetorotational instability may be additional driving sources of turbulence in these galaxies.},

It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H_2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of K$\sim$18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35 square degrees to K$\sim$21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77 square degrees to K$\sim$23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however driven by a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintest sub-stellar objects; to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist; to determine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure from z=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed, and released in stages through the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

TNG50 evolves 2x2160^3 dark-matter particles and gas cells in a volume 50 comoving Mpc across. It hence reaches a numerical resolution typical of zoom-in simulations, with a baryonic element mass of 8.5x10^4 Msun and an average cell size of 70-140 parsecs in the star-forming regions of galaxies. Simultaneously, TNG50 samples $\sim$700 (6,500) galaxies with stellar masses above 10^10 (10^8) Msun at z=1. Here we investigate the structural and kinematical evolution of star-forming galaxies across cosmic time (0 < z < 6). We quantify their sizes, disk heights, 3D shapes, and degree of rotational vs. dispersion-supported motions as traced by rest-frame V-band light (i.e. roughly stellar mass) and by Halpha light (i.e. star-forming and dense gas). The unprecedented resolution of TNG50 enables us to model galaxies with sub-kpc half-light radii and with <300-pc disk heights. Coupled with the large-volume statistics, we characterize a diverse, redshift- and mass-dependent structural and kinematical morphological mix of galaxies all the way to early epochs. Our model predicts that for star-forming galaxies the fraction of disk-like morphologies, based on 3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time and galaxy stellar mass. Gas kinematics reveal that the vast majority of 10^9-11.5 Msun star-forming galaxies are rotationally-supported disks for most cosmic epochs (Vmax/sigma>2-3, z<5), being dynamically hotter at earlier epochs (z>1.5). Despite large velocity dispersion at high redshift, cold and dense gas in galaxies predominantly arranges in disky or elongated shapes at all times and masses; these gaseous components exhibit rotationally-dominated motions far exceeding the collisionless stellar bodies.},

abstract = {We study the properties of black holes and their host galaxies across cosmic time in the Illustris simulation. Illustris is a large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulation which resolves a (106.5Mpc)3 volume with more than 12 billion resolution elements and includes state-of-the-art physical models relevant for galaxy formation. We find that the black hole mass density for redshifts z = 0-5 and the black hole mass function at z = 0 predicted by Illustris are in very good agreement with the most recent observational constraints. We show that the bolometric and hard X-ray luminosity functions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z = 0 and 1 reproduce observational data very well over the full dynamic range probed. Unless the bolometric corrections are largely underestimated, this requires radiative efficiencies to be on average low, $\epsilon$r ≲0.1, noting however that in our model radiative efficiencies are degenerate with black hole feedback efficiencies. Cosmic downsizing of the AGN population is in broad agreement with the findings from X-ray surveys, but we predict a larger number density of faint AGN at high redshifts than currently inferred. We also study black hole-host galaxy scaling relations as a function of galaxy morphology, colour and specific star formation rate. We find that black holes and galaxies co-evolve at the massive end, but for low mass, blue and star-forming galaxies there is no tight relation with either their central black hole masses or the nuclear AGN activity.},

abstract = {The study of galaxy protoclusters is beginning to fill in unknown details of the important phase of the assembly of clusters and cluster galaxies. This review describes the current status of this field and highlights promising recent findings related to galaxy formation in the densest regions of the early universe. We discuss the main search techniques and the characteristic properties of protoclusters in observations and simulations, and show that protoclusters will have present-day masses similar to galaxy clusters when fully collapsed. We discuss the physical properties of galaxies in protoclusters, including (proto-)brightest cluster galaxies, and the forming red sequence. We highlight the fact that the most massive halos at high redshift are found in protoclusters, making these objects uniquely suited for testing important recent models of galaxy formation. We show that galaxies in protoclusters should be among the first galaxies at high redshift making the transition from a gas cooling regime dominated by cold streams to a regime dominated by hot intracluster gas, which could be tested observationally. We also discuss the possible connections between protoclusters and radio galaxies, quasars, and Ly $\alpha$ blobs. Because of their early formation, large spatial sizes and high total star-formation rates, protoclusters have also likely played a crucial role during the epoch of reionization, which can be tested with future experiments that will map the neutral and ionized cosmic web. Lastly, we review a number of promising observational projects that are expected to make significant impact in this growing, exciting field.},

abstract = {Using a sample of 57377 star-forming galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we study the relationship between gas-phase oxygen abundance and environment in the local Universe. We find that there is a strong relationship between metallicity and environment such that more metal-rich galaxies favour regions of higher overdensity. Furthermore, this metallicity-density relation is comparable in strength to the colour-density relation along the blue cloud. After removing the mean dependence of environment on colour and luminosity, we find a weak, though significant, residual trend between metallicity and environment which is largely driven by galaxies in high-density regions, such as groups and clusters. We discuss the potential source of this relationship between metallicity and local galaxy density in the context of feedback models, with special attention paid to quantifying the impact of environment on the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation. We find that environment is a non-negligible source of scatter in this fundamental relation, with >$\sim$15 per cent of the measured scatter correlated with environment.},

abstract = {We present the first results from ROMULUSC, the highest resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a galaxy cluster run to date. ROMULUSC, a zoom-in simulation of a halo with z = 0 mass 1014 M, is run with the same sub-grid physics and resolution as ROMULUS25. With unprecedented mass and spatial resolution, ROMULUSC represents a unique opportunity to study the evolution of galaxies in dense environments down to dwarf masses. We demonstrate that ROMULUSC results in an intracluster medium consistent with observations. The star formation history and stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is consistent with observations and abundance matching results, indicating that our sub-grid models, optimized only to reproduce observations of field dwarf and Milky Way mass galaxies, are able to produce reasonable galaxy masses and star formation histories in much higher mass systems. Feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulates star formation by driving large-scale, collimated outflows that coexist with a low-entropy core. We find that non-BCG cluster member galaxies are substantially quenched compared to the field down to dwarf galaxy masses and, at low masses, quenching is seen to have no dependence on mass or distance from the cluster centre. This enhanced quenched population extends beyond R200 and is in place at high redshift. Similarly, we predict that an SMBH activity is significantly suppressed within clusters outside of the BCG, but show how the effect could be lost when only focusing on the brightest active galactic nucleus in the most massive galaxies.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We explored 18 clusters from LoCuSS at z$\sim$0.2 with ACReS spectra of $\sim$1800 cluster members at R<R200 in a mass-complete sample. The metallicities of SF cluster galaxies with R<R200 were found to be enhanced with respect to the MZR of coeval field SF galaxies. This metallicity enhancement is limited to lower-mass satellites of the 9 clusters with a passive BCG. Many of the SF galaxies with enhanced metallicities are found in the core regions of the phase-space diagram expected for virialized populations. We find a higher fraction of higher mass SF galaxies at R<R500 in clusters with active BCGs compared to clusters with passive BCGs, a signal for galactic conformity. In contrast, much higher fractions of AGNs and especially recently quenched galaxies (RQGs) at R<R500 are found in clusters with passive BCGs in comparison to clusters with active BCGs. We deduce that strangulation is initiated in clusters with passive BCGs when SF satellite galaxies pass R200, by stopping the pristine gas inflow which would otherwise dilute the ISM and would maintain their metallicities at values similar to those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. For galaxies with higher masses which survived to be SF when travelling to R<R500 of clusters with passive BCGs, we assume that they suffer a rapid quenching of star formation, likely due to AGNs triggered by the increasing RPS toward the cluster center, which can compress the gas and fuel AGNs; these AGNs can rapidly quench and maintain quenched satellite galaxies. On the other hand, we found that surviving SF massive satellite galaxies around active BCGs are less affected by environment when they enter R<R500, since we observe R<R500 SF galaxies with higher masses and with metallicities typical of coeval field galaxies. This observed galactic conformity implies that active BCGs must maintain their activity over timescales of at least $\sim$1Gyr.},

abstract = {We present a census of the molecular gas properties of galaxies in the most distant known X-ray cluster, CLJ1001, at z=2.51, using deep observations of CO(1-0) with JVLA. In total 14 cluster members with M∗ > 1010.5M☉ are detected, including all the massive star-forming members within the virial radius, providing the largest galaxy sample in a single cluster at z > 2 with CO(1-0) measurements. We find a large variety in the gas content of these cluster galaxies, which is correlated with their relative positions (or accretion states), with those closer to the cluster core being increasingly gas-poor. Moreover, despite their low gas content, the galaxies in the cluster center exhibit an elevated star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/Mgas) compared to field galaxies, suggesting that the suppression on the SFR is likely delayed compared to that on the gas content. Their gas depletion time is around tdep ∼ 400 Myrs, comparable to the cluster dynamical time. This implies that they will likely consume all their gas within a single orbit around the cluster center, and form a passive cluster core by z ∼ 2. This result is one of the first direct pieces of evidence for the influence of environment on the gas reservoirs and SFE of z > 2 cluster galaxies, thereby providing new insights into the rapid formation and quenching of the most massive galaxies in the early universe.},

With medium-depth Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations (4 h on target per field), we characterize the effects of quasars on their surroundings by studying simultaneously the properties of extended gas nebulae and Ly $\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in the quasar host haloes. We detect extended (up to ≈100 kpc) Ly $\alpha$ emission around all MAGG quasars, finding a very weak redshift evolution between z = 3 and z = 6. By stacking the MUSE datacubes, we confidently detect extended emission of C IV and only marginally detect extended He II up to ≈40 kpc, implying that the gas is metal enriched. Moreover, our observations show a significant overdensity of LAEs within 300 km s−1 from the quasar systemic redshifts estimated from the nebular emission. The luminosity functions and equivalent width distributions of these LAEs show similar shapes with respect to LAEs away from quasars suggesting that the Ly $\alpha$ emission of the majority of these sources is not significantly boosted by the quasar radiation or other processes related to the quasar environment. Within this framework, the observed LAE overdensities and our kinematic measurements imply that bright quasars at z = 3-4.5 are hosted by haloes in the mass range ≈ 1012.0-1012.5 M☉},

abstract = {We present new Keck spectroscopy of early-type galaxies in three galaxy clusters at z$\sim$0.5. We focus on the fundamental plane (FP) relation, and combine the kinematics with structural parameters determined from HST images. The galaxies obey clear FP relations, which are offset from the FP of the nearby Coma cluster due to passive evolution of the stellar populations. The z$\sim$0.5 data are combined with published data for 11 additional clusters at 0.18<z<1.28, to determine the evolution of the mean M/L(B) ratio of cluster galaxies with masses M>10^11 M_sun, as implied by the FP. We find dlog(M/L(B))/dz = -0.555+-0.042, stronger evolution than was previously inferred from smaller samples. The observed evolution depends on the luminosity-weighted mean age of the stars in the galaxies, the initial mass function (IMF), selection effects due to progenitor bias, and other parameters. Assuming a normal IMF but allowing for various other sources of uncertainty we find z* = 2.01+-0.20 for the luminosity-weighted mean star formation epoch. The main uncertainty is the slope of the IMF in the range 1-2 Solar masses: we find z* = 4.0 for a top-heavy IMF with slope x=0. The M/L(B) ratios of the cluster galaxies are compared to those of recently published samples of field early-type galaxies at 0.32<z<1.14. Assuming that progenitor bias and the IMF do not depend on environment we find that the present-day age of stars in massive field galaxies is 4.1 +- 2.0 % ($\sim$0.4 Gyr) less than that of stars in massive cluster galaxies, consistent with most, but not all, previous studies of local and distant early-type galaxies. This relatively small age difference is surprising in the context of expectations from ``standard'' hierarchical galaxy formation models. [ABRIDGED]},

abstract = {Galaxy-galaxy interactions and large scale galaxy bars are usually considered as the two main mechanisms for driving gas to the centres of galaxies. By using large samples of galaxy pairs and visually classified bars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we compare the relative efficiency of gas inflows from these two processes. We use two indicators of gas inflow: star formation rate (SFR) and gas phase metallicity, which are both measured relative to control samples. Whereas the metallicity of galaxy pairs is suppressed relative to its control sample of isolated galaxies, galaxies with bars are metal-rich for their stellar mass by 0.06 dex over all stellar masses. The SFRs of both the close galaxy pairs and the barred galaxies are enhanced by ∼60%, but in the bars the enhancement is only seen at stellar masses M * > 1010 M⊙. Taking into account the relative frequency of bars and pairs, we estimate that at least three times more central star formation is triggered by bars than by interactions. {\textcopyright} Copyright International Astronomical Union 2011.},

abstract = {The star-formation history (SFH) of galaxies is a key assumption to derive their physical properties and can lead to strong biases. In this work, we derive the SFH of main sequence (MS) galaxies and show how the peak SFH of a galaxy depends on its seed mass at, for example, z = 5. This seed mass reflects the galaxy's underlying dark matter (DM) halo environment. We show that, following the MS, galaxies undergo a drastic slow down of their stellar mass growth after reaching the peak of their SFH. According to abundance matching, these masses correspond to hot and massive DM halos which state could result in less efficient gas inflows on the galaxies and thus could be the origin of limited stellar mass growth. As a result, we show that galaxies, still on the MS, can enter the passive region of the UVJ diagram while still forming stars. The best fit to the MS SFH is provided by a right skew peak function for which we provide parameters depending on the seed mass of the galaxy. The ability of the classical analytical SFHs to retrieve the star-formation rate (SFR) of galaxies from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is studied. Due to mathematical limitations, the exponentially declining and delayed SFH struggle to model high SFR, which starts to be problematic at z > 2. The exponentially rising and log-normal SFHs exhibit the opposite behavior with the ability to reach very high SFR, and thus model starburst galaxies, but they are not able to model low values such as those expected at low redshift for massive galaxies. By simulating galaxies SED from the MS SFH, we show that these four analytical forms recover the SFR of MS galaxies with an error dependent on the model and the redshift. They are, however, sensitive enough to probe small variations of SFR within the MS, with an error ranging from 5 to 40% depending on the SFH assumption and redshift; but all the four fail to recover the SFR of rapidly quenched galaxies. However, these SFHs lead to an artificial gradient of age, parallel to the MS, which is not exhibited by the simulated sample. This gradient is also produced on real data as we show using a sample of real galaxies with redshifts between 1.5 and 2.5. Here, we propose an SFH composed of a delayed form to model the bulk of stellar population with the addition of a flexibility in the recent SFH. This SFH provides very good estimates of the SFR of MS, starbursts, and rapidly quenched galaxies at all redshift. Furthermore, when used on the real sample, the age gradient disappears which show its dependency on the SFH assumption made to perform the SED fitting.},

abstract = {We present the analysis, based on spectra collected at the Large Binocular Telescope, of the stellar populations in seven spheroidal galaxies in the cluster XLSSJ0223 at $z$$\sim$1.22. The aim is to constrain the epoch of their formation and their star formation history. Using absorption line strenghts and full spectral fitting, we derive for the stellar populations of the seven spheroids a median age <Age>=2.4$\pm$0.6 Gyr, corresponding to a median formation redshift $<$$z_f$$>$$\sim2.6_{-0.5}^{+0.7}$ (lookback time = 11$_{-1.0}^{+0.6}$ Gyr). We find a significant scatter in age, showing that massive spheroids, at least in our targeted cluster, are not coeval. The median metallicity is [Z/H]=0.09$\pm$0.16, as for early-types in clusters at 0$<$$z$<0.9. This lack of evolution of [Z/H] over the range 0$<$$z$$<$1.3, corresponding to the last 9 billions years, suggests that no significant additional star formation and chemical enrichment are required for cluster spheroids to reach the present-day population. We do not detect significant correlation between age and velocity dispersion $\sigma_e$, or dynamical mass M$_{dyn}$, or effective stellar mass density $\Sigma_e$. On the contrary, the metallicity [Z/H] of the seven spheroids is correlated to their dynamical mass M$_{dyn}$, according to a relation similar to the one for local spheroids. [Z/H] is also anticorrelated to stellar mass density $\Sigma_e$ because of the anticorrelation between M$_{dyn}$ and $\Sigma_e$. Therefore, the basic trends observed in the local universe were already established at $z\sim1.3$, i.e. more massive spheroids are more metal rich, have lower stellar mass density and tend to be older than lower-mass galaxies.},

abstract = {We present the cumulative star-formation histories (SFHs) of >15000 dwarf galaxies ($M_{*}=10^{7-10}M_{\odot}$) from the TNG50 run of the IllustrisTNG suite across a vast range of environments. The key factors determining the dwarfs' SFHs are their status as central or satellite and their stellar mass, with centrals and more massive dwarfs assembling their stellar mass at later times on average compared to satellites and lower mass dwarfs. The satellites (in hosts of total mass $M_{200c,\,host}=10^{12-14.3}M_{\odot}$) assembled 90% of their z=0 stellar mass $\sim$$7.0_{-5.5}^{+3.3}$ Gyr ago, while the centrals did so only $\sim$$1.0_{-0.5}^{+4.0}$ Gyr ago. TNG50 predicts a large diversity in SFHs for both centrals and satellites, so that the stacked cumulative SFHs are representative of the TNG50 dwarf populations only in an average sense and individual dwarfs can have significantly different cumulative SFHs. Satellite dwarfs with the highest stellar mass to host mass ratios have the latest stellar mass assembly. Satellites at fixed stellar and host halo mass, found closer to the cluster centre, or accreted at earlier times, show significantly earlier stellar mass assembly. These trends, as well as the shapes of the SFHs themselves, are a manifestation of the varying proportions within a given subsample of quenched vs. star-forming galaxies, which exhibit markedly distinct SFH shapes. We also find a subtle effect whereby satellite dwarfs in the most massive hosts at z=0 have higher SFRs at early times, well before final infall into their z=0 host, compared to a control sample of centrals mass-matched at the time of accretion. This suggests that the large-scale environment can have a mild effect even on future satellites by providing the conditions for enhanced SF at early epochs. Our results are useful theoretical predictions for comparison to future resolved-stellar-population observations.},

abstract = {Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic product is "any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions". However, science advancement in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products as "cosmeceuticals", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying, for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues, produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective, whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier, has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.},

abstract = {Aims: We aim to investigate if the environment (characterised by the host dark matter halo mass) plays any role in shaping the galaxy star formation main sequence (MS). Methods: The Galaxy and Mass Assembly project (GAMA) combines a spectroscopic survey with photometric information in 21 bands from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the far-infrared (FIR). Stellar masses and dust-corrected star-formation rates (SFR) are derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling using MAGPHYS. We use the GAMA galaxy group catalogue to examine the variation of the fraction of star-forming galaxies (SFG) and properties of the MS with respect to the environment. Results: We examine the environmental dependence for stellar mass selected samples without preselecting star-forming galaxies and study any dependence on the host halo mass separately for centrals and satellites out to z ∼ 0.3. We find the SFR distribution at fixed stellar mass can be described by the combination of two Gaussians (referred to as the star-forming Gaussian and the quiescent Gaussian). Using the observed bimodality to define SFG, we investigate how the fraction of SFG F(SFG) and properties of the MS change with environment. For centrals, the position of the MS is similar to the field but with a larger scatter. No significant dependence on halo mass is observed. For satellites, the position of the MS is almost always lower (by ∼0.2 dex) compared to the field and the width is almost always larger. F(SFG) is similar between centrals (in different halo mass bins) and field galaxies. However, for satellites F(SFG) decreases with increasing halo mass and this dependence is stronger towards lower redshift.},

abstract = {We have used extensive libraries of model and empirical galaxy spectra [assembled, respectively, from the population synthesis code of Bruzual and Charlot and the fourth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)] to interpret some puzzling features seen in the spectra of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We show that a stellar HeII$\lambda$1640 emission line, produced in the expanding atmospheres of Of and Wolf-Rayet stars, should be detectable with an equivalent width of 0.5-1.5{\AA} in the integrated spectra of star-forming galaxies, provided the metallicity is greater than about half solar. Our models reproduce the strength of the HeII$\lambda$1640 line measured in the spectra of Lyman-break galaxies for established values of their metallicities. With better empirical calibrations in local galaxies, this spectral feature has the potential of becoming a useful diagnostic of massive star winds at high, as well as low redshifts. We also uncover a relationship in SDSS galaxies between their location in the [OIII]/H$\beta$ versus [NII]/H$\alpha$ diagnostic diagram (the BPT diagram) and their excess specific star formation rate relative to galaxies of similar mass. We infer that an elevated ionization parameter U is at the root of this effect, and propose that this is also the cause of the offset of high-redshift star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram compared to local ones. We further speculate that higher electron densities and escape fractions of hydrogen ionizing photons may be the factors responsible for the systematically higher values of U in the HII regions of high-redshift galaxies. The impact of such differences on abundance determinations from strong nebular lines are considered and found to be relatively minor.},

abstract = {A comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4-8 per cent of the baryon density (assuming $\Omega$b = 0.045). There remain significant sources of uncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratio even assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. We determine the z < 0.05 GSMF using the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog sample of 49 968 galaxies derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and various estimates of stellar mass. The GSMF shows clear evidence for a low-mass upturn and is fitted with a double Schechter function that has $\alpha$2 ≃ -1.6. At masses below ∼108.5 M⊙, the GSMF may be significantly incomplete because of missing low-surface-brightness galaxies. One interpretation of the stellar mass-metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction of available baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this principle, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellar mass and present an 'implied baryonic mass function'. This function has a faint-end slope, $\alpha$2 ≃ -1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as the halo mass function. We illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic mass function → galaxy baryonic mass function → GSMF. This demonstrates the requirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ∼1011 M⊙ corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. The baryonic-infall efficiency may have levelled off at lower masses. {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

This unique instrument deploys 13 fused fiber bundles (hexabundles) across a one-degree field of view allowing simultaneous spatially resolved spectroscopy of 13 galaxies. During the first SAMI commissioning run, targeting a single galaxy field, one object (ESO 185-G031) was found to have extended minor axis emission with ionization and kinematic properties consistent with a large-scale galactic wind. The importance of this result is twofold: (1) fiber bundle spectrographs are able to identify low surface brightness emission arising from extranuclear activity and (2) such activity may be more common than presently assumed because conventional multi-object spectrographs use single-aperture fibers and spectra from these are nearly always dominated by nuclear emission. These early results demonstrate the extraordinary potential of multi-object hexabundle spectroscopy in future galaxy surveys. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations of 466 galaxies in and around a superstructure at z ∼ 0.84 targeted by the VIMOS Spectroscopic Survey of a Supercluster in the COSMOS field (VIS 3 COS). We use [O II ] $\lambda$ 3727, H $\delta$ , and D n 4000 to trace recent, medium-, and long-term star formation histories and investigate the effect of stellar mass and local environment on them. By studying trends in individual and composite galaxy spectra, we find that stellar mass and environment play a role in the observed galactic properties. Galaxies with low stellar mass (10 < log 10 ( M ⋆ / M ⊙ ) < 10.5) in the field show the strongest H $\delta$ absorption. Similarly, the massive population (log 10 ( M ⋆ / M ⊙ ) > 11) shows an increase in H $\delta$ absorption strengths in intermediate-density environments (e.g. filaments). Galaxies with intermediate stellar mass (10.5 < log 10 ( M ⋆ / M ⊙ ) < 11) have similar H $\delta$ absorption profiles in all environments, but show an indication of enhanced [O II ] emission in intermediate-density environments. This indicates that field galaxies with low stellar mass and filament galaxies with high stellar mass are more likely to have experienced a recent burst of star formation, while galaxies of the intermediate stellar-mass show an increase of star formation at filament-like densities. We also find that the median [O II ] equivalent width (|EW [OII] |) decreases from 27 ± 2 {\AA} to 2.0 +0.5 −0.4 {\AA} and D n 4000 increases from 1.09 ± 0.01 to 1.56 ± 0.03 with increasing stellar mass (from ∼10 9.25 to ∼10 11.35 M ⊙ ). For the dependence on the environment, we find that at fixed stellar mass, |EW [OII] | is tentatively lower in environments with higher density. We find for D n 4000 that the increase with stellar mass is sharper in denser environments, which indicates that these environments may accelerate galaxy evolution. Moreover, we find higher D n 4000 values in denser environments at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that galaxies are on average older and/or more metal rich in these dense environments. This set of tracers depicts a scenario where the most massive galaxies have, on average, the lowest specific star formation rates and the oldest stellar populations (age ≳ 1 Gyr, showing a mass-downsizing effect). We also hypothesize that the observed increase in star formation (higher EW [OII]| , higher specific star formation rate) at intermediate densities may lead to quenching because we find that the quenched fraction increases sharply from the filament to cluster-like regions at similar stellar masses.},

abstract = {Broadband photometry of galaxies measures an unresolved mix of complex stellar populations, gas, and dust. Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector-$\alpha$, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a 6-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with MCMC sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts H$\alpha$ luminosities with a scatter of $\sim$0.18 dex and an offset of $\sim$0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the H$\alpha$ luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, PAH mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features D$_{\mathrm{n}}$4000 and H$\delta$. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.},

abstract = {The environment is known to affect the formation and evolution of galaxies considerably best visible through the well-known morphology-density relationship. It is less clear, though, whether the environment is equally important at a given galaxy morphology. In this paper, we study the effect of environment on the evolution of early-type galaxies as imprinted in the fossil record by analysing the stellar population properties of 3360 galaxies morphologically selected by visual inspection from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a narrow redshift range (0.05 ≤z ≤ 0.06). The morphological selection algorithm is critical, as it does not bias against recent star formation. We find that the distribution of ages is bimodal with a strong peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around ∼2.5 Gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects. This is an analogue to 'red sequence' and 'blue cloud' identified in galaxy populations usually containing both early- and late-type galaxies. The fraction of the young, rejuvenated galaxies increases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasing environmental density up to about 45 per cent, which implies that the impact of environment increases with decreasing galaxy mass. The rejuvenated galaxies have lower $\alpha$/Fe ratios than the average and most of them show signs of ongoing star formation through their emission line spectra. All objects that host active galactic nuclei in their centres without star formation are part of the red sequence population. We confirm and statistically strengthen earlier results that luminosity weighted ages, metallicities and $\alpha$/Fe element ratios of the red sequence population correlate well with velocity dispersion and galaxy mass. Most interestingly, however, these scaling relations are not sensitive to environmental densities and are only driven by galaxy mass. We infer that early-type galaxy formation has undergone a phase transition a few billion years ago around z ∼ 0.2. A self-regulated formation phase without environmental dependence has recently been superseded by a rejuvenation phase, in which the environment plays a decisive role possibly through galaxy mergers and interactions. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

Structural parameters are measured for each member by fitting a PSF-convolved, two component model to their 2D surface brightness distribution. We examine bulge+disk models using three different bulge profiles (de Vaucouleurs, Sersic, and exponential), and rigorously test the robustness of our results by analyzing several thousand artificial galaxies in the same manner as the cluster data. Combining structural parameters with ground-based spectroscopy, we test for correlations between morphological characteristics, current star formation, total galaxy colors, and cluster substructure. We find that: (1) Using a de Vaucouleurs bulge, bulge-to-total ratios and Hubble type (-5<T<8) are strongly correlated (99% CL), but the scatter is large and early-type spirals are not reliably distinguished from E's and S0's based on (B/T). (2) The low luminosity ellipticals in our sample are likely to be face-on S0 galaxies. (3) High galaxy asymmetry and strong [OII] emission are strongly correlated for disk-dominated members. (4) There exists a small population ($\sim$5%) of bulge-dominated members whose significant [OII] emission (<-5A) suggest they harbor AGN.

abstract = {The gas needed to sustain star foation in galaxies is supplied by the circumgalactic medium (CGM), which in turn is affected by accretion from large scales. In a series of two papers, we examine the interplay between a galaxy's ambient CGM and central star foation within the context of the large-scale environment. We use the IllustrisTNG-100 silation to show that the influence exerted by the large-scale galaxy environment on the CGM gas angular momentum results in either enhanced (Paper I) or suppressed (Paper II, this paper) star foation inside a galaxy. We find that for present-day quenched galaxies, both the large-scale environments and the ambient CGM have always had higher angular momenta throughout their evolutionary history since at least $z$ = 2, in comparison to those around present-day star-foing disc galaxies, resulting in less efficient gas inflow into the central star-foing gas reservoirs. A sufficiently high CGM angular momentum, as inherited from the larger-scale environment, is thus an important factor in keeping a galaxy quenched, once it is quenched. The process above naturally renders two key observational signatures: (1) a coherent rotation pattern existing across ltiple distances from the large-scale galaxy environment, to the circumgalactic gas, to the central stellar disc; and (2) an anticorrelation between galaxy star-foation rates and orbital angular momenta of interacting galaxy pairs or groups.},

abstract = {A model of supernova feedback during disc galaxy formation is developed. The model incorporates infall of cooling gas from a halo, and outflow of hot gas from a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). The star formation rate is determined by balancing the energy dissipated in collisions between cold gas clouds with that supplied by supernovae in a disc marginally unstable to axisymmetric instabilities. Hot gas is created by thermal evaporation of cold gas clouds in supernova remnants, and criteria are derived to estimate the characteristic temperature and density of the hot component and hence the net mass outflow rate. A number of refinements of the model are investigated, including a simple model of a galactic fountain, the response of the cold component to the pressure of the hot gas, pressure-induced star formation and chemical evolution. The main conclusion of this paper is that low rates of star formation can expel a large fraction of the gas from a dwarf galaxy. For example, a galaxy with circular speed ∼50 km s-1 can expel ∼60-80 per cent of its gas over a time-scale of ∼1 Gyr, with a star formation rate that never exceeds ∼0.1 M⊙ yr-1. Effective feedback can therefore take place in a quiescent mode and does not require strong bursts of star formation. Even a large galaxy, such as the Milky Way, might have lost as much as 20 per cent of its mass in a supernova-driven wind. The models developed here suggest that dwarf galaxies at high redshifts will have low average star formation rates and may contain extended gaseous discs of largely unprocessed gas. Such extended gaseous discs might explain the numbers, metallicities and metallicity dispersions of damped Lyman $\alpha$ systems.},

This group catalog is based on the first near-IR all-sky flux-limited survey that is complete to |b|=5deg. We explore the dependence of the clustering on the length and velocity scales involved. The paper describes a group catalog, complete to a limiting redshift of 104 km s-1, created by maximizing the number of groups containing three or more members. A second catalog is also presented, created by requiring a minimum density contrast of to identify groups. We identify known nearby clusters in the catalogs and contrast the groups identified in the two catalogs. We examine and compare the properties of the determined groups and verify that the results are consistent with the UZC-SSRS2 and northern CfA redshift survey group catalogs. The all-sky nature of the catalog will allow the development of a flow-field model based on the density field inferred from the estimated cluster masses.},

abstract = {We study the stellar morphological evolution of disk galaxies within clusters in the TNG50 and TNG100 runs from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. We select satellites of masses $10^{9.7}<=M_{*,z=0}/M_{sun}<=10^{11.6}$ residing in clusters of total masses $10^{14}<=M_{\text{200c,z=0}}/M_{sun}<10^{14.6}$ at z=0 and study those that were disks at accretion according to a kinematic morphology indicator (the circularity fraction). The galaxies' histories are traced from the time of accretion to $z=0$ and compared to a control sample of central galaxies mass-matched at the time of accretion. Most cluster disks become non-disky by z=0, in stark contrast with the control disks, of which a significant fraction remains disky over the same timescales. The transformation to non-disky morphologies is accompanied by gas removal and star formation quenching for both cluster and control galaxies. However, cluster disks that become non-disky by z=0 have lost dark matter (DM) mass and show little growth or a loss of stellar mass, whereas the corresponding control disks show significant growth in both components. Most cluster satellites change their morphologies on similar timescales regardless of stellar mass, in $\sim$0.5-4 Gyr after accretion. Cluster disks that have had more numerous and closer pericentric passages show the largest change in morphology. Morphological change in both cluster and control disks requires the presence of a gravitational perturbation to drive stellar orbits to non-disky configurations, along with gas removal/heating to prevent replenishment of the disk through continued star-formation. For cluster disks, the perturbation is in the form of impulsive tidal shocking at pericentres and not tidal stripping of the outer disk stellar material, whereas for control disks, a combination of mergers and AGN feedback appears to be the key driving force behind morphological transformations.},

abstract = {We measure spectral features of $\sim$3500 K-selected galaxies at 0.5<z<2.0 from high quality medium-band photometry using a new technique. First, we divide the galaxy sample in 32 subsamples based on the similarities between the full spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the galaxies. For each of these 32 galaxy types we construct a composite SED by de-redshifting and scaling the observed photometry. This approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio and sampling of galaxy SEDs and allows for model-independent stellar population studies. The composite SEDs are of spectroscopic quality, and facilitate -- for the first time -- Halpha measurement for a large magnitude-limited sample of distant galaxies. The linewidths indicate a photometric redshift uncertainty of dz<0.02x(1+z). The composite SEDs also show the Balmer and 4000 Angstrom breaks, MgII absorption at $\sim$2800 Angstrom, the dust absorption feature at 2175 Angstrom, and blended [OIII]+Hbeta emission. We compare the total equivalent width of Halpha, [NII], and [SII] (W_Halpha+) with the strength of the 4000 Angstrom break (D(4000)) and the best-fit specific star formation rate, and find that all these properties are strongly correlated. This is a reassuring result, as currently most distant stellar population studies are based on just continuum emission. Furthermore, the relation between W_Halpha+ and Dn(4000) provides interesting clues to the SFHs of galaxies, as these features are sensitive to different stellar ages. We find that the correlation between W_Halpha+ and D(4000) at 0.5<z<2.0 is similar to z$\sim$0, and that the suppression of star formation in galaxies at z<2 is generally not abrupt, but a gradual process.},

abstract = {The star formation quenching depends on environment, but a full understanding of what mechanisms drive it is still missing. Exploiting a sample of galaxies with masses $M_\ast>10^{9.8}M_\odot$, drawn from the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS) and its recent extension OMEGAWINGS, we investigate the star formation rate (SFR) as a function of stellar mass (M$_*$) in galaxy clusters at $0.04<z<0.07$. We use non-member galaxies at 0.02$<$z$<$0.09 as field control sample. Overall, we find agreement between the SFR-M$_*$ relation in the two environments, but detect a population of cluster galaxies with reduced SFRs which is rare in the field. These {\it transition} galaxies are mainly found within the cluster virial radius ($R_{200}$) but they impact on the SFR-M$_*$ relation only within 0.6R$_{200}$. The ratio of transition to PSF galaxies strongly depends on environment, being larger than 0.6 within 0.3R$_{200}$ and rapidly decreasing with distance, while it is almost flat with $M_*$. As galaxies move downward from the SFR-M$_*$ main sequence, they become redder and present older luminosity and mass weighted ages. These trends, together with the analysis of the star formation histories, suggest that transition galaxies have had a reduced SFR for the past 2-5 Gyr. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the interaction of galaxies with the intracluster medium via strangulation causes a gradual shut down of star formation, giving birth to an evolved population of galaxies in transition from being star forming to becoming passive.},

abstract = {In order to understand the processes that quench star formation in cluster galaxies, we construct a library of subhalo orbits drawn from $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmological N-body simulations of four rich clusters. We combine these orbits with models of star formation followed by environmental quenching, comparing model predictions with observed bulge and disc colours and stellar absorption line-strength indices of luminous cluster galaxies. Models in which the bulge stellar populations depend only on the galaxy subhalo mass while the disc is quenched upon infall are acceptable fits to the data. An exponential disc quenching time-scale of 3-3.5 Gyr is preferred. Quenching in lower mass groups prior to infall ('pre-processing') provides better fits, with similar quenching time-scales. Models with short (≲1 Gyr) quenching time-scales yield excessively steep cluster-centric gradients in disc colours and Balmer line indices, even if quenching is delayed for several Gyr. The data slightly prefer models where quenching occurs only for galaxies falling within $\sim$0.5r200. These results imply that the environments of rich clusters must impact star formation rates of infalling galaxies on relatively long time-scales, indicative of gentler quenching mechanisms such as slow 'strangulation' over more rapid ram-pressure stripping. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the source catalog obtained from a 942 ks exposure of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS), using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I) on the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Eleven individual pointings made between 1999 October and 2000 December were combined to generate the final image used for object detection. Catalog generation proceeded simultaneously using two different methods; a method of our own design using a modified version of the SExtractor algorithm, and a wavelet transform technique developed specifically for Chandra observations. The detection threshold has been set in order to have less than 10 spurious sources, as assessed by extensive simulations. We subdivided the catalog into four sections. The primary list consists of objects common to the two detection methods. Two secondary lists contain sources which were detected by (1) the SExtractor algorithm alone and (2) the wavelet technique alone. The fourth list consists of possible diffuse or extended sources. The flux limits at the aimpoint for the soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (2-10 keV) bands are 5.5 × 10 -17  erg s -1  cm -2  and 4.5 × 10 -16  erg s  -1  cm -2 , respectively. The total number of sources is 346; out of them, 307 were detected in the 0.5-2 keV band, and 251 in the 2-10 keV band. We also present optical identifications for the cataloged sources. Our primary optical data are R band imaging from VLT/FORS1 to a depth of R ∼ 26.5 (Vega). In regions of the field not covered by the VLT/FORS1 deep imaging, we use R-band data obtained with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the ESO-MPI 2.2 m telescope, as part of the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS), which cover the entire X-ray survey. We found that the FORS1/Chandra offsets are small, ∼1″. Coordinate cross-correlation finds 85% of the Chandra sources covered by FORS1 R to have counterparts within the 3 $\sigma$ error box (≳ 1″.5 depending on off-axis angle and X-ray signal-to-noise). The unidentified fraction of sources, approximately ∼10%-15%, is close to the limit expected from the observed X-ray flux to R-band ratio distribution for the identified sample.},

Our analysis uniquely combines U to 8 $\mu$m photometry from FIREWORKS, MIPS 24 $\mu$m and PACS 70, 100, and 160 $\mu$m photometry from the PEP, and H$\alpha$ spectroscopy from the SINS survey. We describe a set of conversions that lead to a continuity across SFR indicators. A luminosity-independent conversion from 24 $\mu$m to total infrared luminosity yields estimates of L IR that are in the median consistent with the L IR derived from PACS photometry, albeit with significant scatter. Dust correction methods perform well at low-to-intermediate levels of star formation. They fail to recover the total amount of star formation in systems with large SFRIR/SFRUV ratios, typically occuring at the highest SFRs (SFRUV + IR ≳ 100 Myr-1) and redshifts (z ≳ 2.5) probed. Finally, we confirm that H$\alpha$-based SFRs at 1.5 < z < 2.6 are consistent with SFRSED and SFRUV + IR provided extra attenuation toward H II regions is taken into account (A V,neb = A V,continuum/0.44). With the cross-calibrated SFR indicators in hand, we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferred from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. We compare the observed SFR-M relations and mass functions at a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lower redshift galaxies backward in time. We find evidence for underestimated stellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied in SED modeling. We demonstrate how resolved SED modeling, or alternatively deep UV data, may help to overcome this bias. The age bias is most severe for galaxies with young stellar populations and reduces toward older systems. Finally, our analysis suggests that SFHs typically vary on timescales that are long (at least several 100Myr) compared to the galaxies' dynamical time. {\textcopyright} 2011.

The distribution of N(H I) among the mergers is significantly different from that found in isolated systems, with mergers giving rise to six times stronger absorption on average. The fraction of redshifted absorption components (with respect to the systemic velocity of the radio source obtained from optical emission lines) among mergers is found to be higher by two to three times compared to that found for non-interacting systems.

One of the two is associated with an extended X-ray emission at 4.5 sigma on a scale of 0'.5, which is typical of high-z clusters.

abstract = {We utilize Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging and spectroscopy of $\sim$53,000 star-forming galaxies at z$\sim$0.1 to study the relation between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity. We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses using new techniques which make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 10^{8.5} - 10^{10.5} M_sun, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 10^{10.5} M_sun. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the H-alpha luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anti-correlated with baryonic mass, with low mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal-depleted than L* galaxies at z$\sim$0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies, but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 10^{10} M_sun. We interpret this as strong evidence both of the ubiquity of galactic winds and of their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.},

We track cosmic filaments with the versatile, observation-friendly program DisPerSE and identify halos hosting galaxies with VELOCIRaptor. We find that cluster galaxies close to filaments tend to be more star-forming, bluer, and contain more cold gas than their counterparts further away from filaments. This effect is recovered at all stellar masses. This is in stark contrast with galaxies residing outside of clusters, where galaxies close to filaments show clear signs of density related pre-processing. We first show that the density contrast of filaments is reduced inside the intra-cluster medium. Moreover, examination of flows around and into cluster galaxies shows that the gas flows in intra-cluster filaments are colder and tend to stream along with galaxies in their midst, partially shielding them from strangulation by the hot, dense intra-cluster medium. This also preserves accretion onto satellites and limit ram pressure.},

abstract = {We use the MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey to study the kinematics of extended disc-like structures of cold gas around z ≈ 1 star-forming galaxies. The combination of VLT/MUSE and VLT/UVES observations allows us to connect the kinematics of the gas measured through Mg II quasar absorption spectroscopy to the kinematics and orientation of the associated galaxies constrained through integral field spectroscopy. Confirming previous results, we find that the galaxy-absorber pairs of the MEGAFLOW survey follow a strong bimodal distribution, consistent with a picture of Mg II absorption being predominantly present in outflow cones and extended disc-like structures. This allows us to select a bona-fide sample of galaxy-absorber pairs probing these discs for impact paramometers of 10-70 kpc. We test the hypothesis that the disc-like gas is co-rotating with the galaxy discs, and find that for seven out of nine pairs the absorption velocity shares the sign of the disc velocity, disfavouring random orbits. We further show that the data are roughly consistent with inflow velocities and angular momenta predicted by simulations, and that the corresponding mass accretion rates are sufficient to balance the star formation rates.},

abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 10 10 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 $\mu$m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

abstract = {We study the star formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies as a function of local galaxy density at 0.6 < z < 0.9. We used a low-dispersion prism in IMACS on the 6.5m Baade (Magellan I) telescope to obtain spectra and measured redshifts to a precision of $\sigma$z/(1 + z) 1 for galaxies with z AB < 23.3mag. We utilized a stellar mass-limited sample of 977 galaxies above M > 1.8 × 1010 M (log M/M >10.25) to conduct our main analysis. With three different SFR indicators, (1) Spitzer MIPS 24 $\mu$m imaging, (2) spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and (3) [O II]$\lambda$3727 emission, we find the median specific SFR (SSFR) and SFR to decline from the low-density field to the cores of groups and a rich cluster. For the SED- and [O II]-based SFRs, the decline in SSFR is roughly an order of magnitude while for the MIPS-based SFRs, the decline is a factor of 4. We find approximately the same magnitude of decline in SSFR even after removing the sample of galaxies near the cluster. Galaxies in groups and a cluster at these redshifts therefore have lower star formation (SF) activity than galaxies in the field, as is the case at z 0. We investigated whether the decline in SFR with increasing density is caused by a change in the proportion of quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) or by a decline in the SFRs of SFGs. Using the rest-frame U - V and V - J colors to distinguish quiescent galaxies from SFGs (including both unattenuated blue galaxies and reddened ones), we find that the fraction of quiescent galaxies increases from 32 to 79 from low to high density. In addition, we find the SSFRs of SFGs, selected based on U - V and V - J colors, to decline with increasing density by factors of 5-6 for the SED- and [O II]-based SFRs. The MIPS-based SSFRs for SFGs decline with a shallower slope. The declining SFRs of SFGs with density are paralleled by a decline in the median AV , providing indirect evidence that the cold gas content that fuels future SF is diminished in higher density environments. The order of magnitude decline in the SSFR-density relation at 0.6 < z < 0.9 is therefore driven by both a combination of declining SFRs of SFGs as well as a changing mix of SFGs and quiescent galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2011.

Both our field and cluster galaxy mass-metallicity relations are consistent with recent field galaxy studies at z ∼ 2. We present hydrodynamical simulations for which we derive mass-metallicity relations for field and cluster galaxies. We find at most a 0.1dex offset towards more metal-rich simulated cluster galaxies.

The subgrid feedback was calibrated to reproduce the observed present-day galaxy stellar mass function and galaxy sizes. Here, we demonstrate that the simulations reproduce the observed growth of the stellar mass density to within 20 per cent. The simulations also track the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function out to redshift z = 7, with differences comparable to the plausible uncertainties in the interpretation of the data. Just as with observed galaxies, the specific star formation rates of simulated galaxies are bimodal, with distinct star forming and passive sequences. The specific star formation rates of star-forming galaxies are typically 0.2 to 0.5 dex lower than observed, but the evolution of the rates track the observations closely. The unprecedented level of agreement between simulation and data across cosmic time makes EAGLE a powerful resource to understand the physical processes that govern galaxy formation.},

abstract = {The existence of ∼109M⊙ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of the Universe has stimulated numerous ideas for the prompt formation and rapid growth of black holes (BHs) in the early Universe. Here, we review ways in which the seeds of massive BHs may have first assembled, how they may have subsequently grown as massive as ∼109M⊙, and how multimessenger observations could distinguish between different SMBH assembly scenarios. We conclude the following: ▪The ultrarare ∼109M⊙ SMBHs represent only the tip of the iceberg. Early BHs likely fill a continuum from the stellar-mass (∼10M⊙) to the supermassive (∼109) regimes, reflecting a range of initial masses and growth histories. ▪Stellar-mass BHs were likely left behind by the first generation of stars at redshifts as high as ∼30, but their initial growth typically was stunted due to the shallow potential wells of their host galaxies. ▪Conditions in some larger, metal-poor galaxies soon became conducive to the rapid formation and growth of massive seed holes, via gas accretion and by mergers in dense stellar clusters. ▪BH masses depend on the environment (such as the number and properties of nearby radiation sources and the local baryonic streaming velocity) and on the metal enrichment and assembly history of the host galaxy. ▪Distinguishing between assembly mechanisms will be difficult, but a combination of observations by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (probing massive BH growth via mergers) and by deep multiwavelength electromagnetic observations (probing growth via gas accretion) is particularly promising.},

abstract = {We use the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations to show how the fractions of quenched galaxies vary across different environments and cosmic time, and to quantify the role AGN feedback and pre-processing play in quenching group and cluster satellites. At z = 0, we select galaxies with Mstars = 109-12 M⊙ residing within (≤R200c) massive groups and clusters of total host mass M200c = 1013-15.2 M⊙ in TNG100 and TNG300. The model predicts a quenched fraction of ∼70-90 per cent (on average) for centrals and satellites of mass ≳1010.5 M⊙, regardless of host mass, cosmic time (0 ≤ z ≤ 0.5), cluster-centric distance, and time since infall in the z = 0 host. Low-mass central galaxies (≲ 1010 M⊙), on the other hand, are rarely quenched unless they become members of groups (1013-14 M⊙) or clusters (≥1014 M⊙), where the quenched fraction rises to ∼ 80 per cent. Typically, the fraction of low-mass passive galaxies is higher closer to the host centre and for progressively more massive hosts. The population of low-mass satellites accreted more than ∼ 4-6 Gyr ago in massive hosts is almost entirely passive, thus suggesting an upper limit for the time needed for environmental quenching to occur. In fact, about 30 per cent of group and cluster satellites that are quenched at z = 0 were already quenched before falling into their current host, and the bulk of them quenched as early as 4-10 billion years ago. For low-mass galaxies (Mstars ≲1010-10.5 M⊙), this is due to pre-processing, whereby current satellites may have been members of other hosts, and hence have undergone environmental processes, before falling into their final host, this mechanism being more common and more effective for the purposes of quenching for satellites found today in more massive hosts. On the other hand, massive galaxies quench on their own and because of AGN feedback, regardless of whether they are centrals or satellites.},

Our motivation is to study and characterize the behavior of WISE source populations in anticipation of the deep multi-wavelength surveys that will define the next decade, with the principal science goal of mapping the 3D large scale structures and determining the global physical attributes of the host galaxies. In combination with cosmological redshifts, we identify galaxies from their WISE W1 3.4um resolved emission, and by performing a star-galaxy separation using apparent magnitude, colors and statistical modeling of star-counts. The resultant galaxy catalog has sources in 60 deg{\^{}}2, reaching a W1 5-sigma depth of 31 uJy. At the faint end, where redshifts are not available, we employ a luminosity function analysis to show that approximately 27{\%} of all WISE extragalactic sources to a limit of 17.5 mag (31 uJy) are at high redshift, z {\textgreater} 1. The spatial distribution is investigated using two-point correlation functions and a 3D source density characterization at 5 Mpc and 20 Mpc scales. For angular distributions, we find brighter and more massive sources are strongly clustered relative to fainter and lower mass source; likewise, based on WISE colors, spheroidal galaxies have the strongest clustering, while late-type disk galaxies have the lowest clustering amplitudes. Along the radial direction, the strongest clustering is in the largest redshift shell, while the weakest is in the nearest redshift shell, consistent with the stellar mass and morphological type dependency results. In three dimensions, we find a number of distinct groupings, often bridged by filaments and super-structures. Using special visualization tools, we map these structures, exploring how clustering may play a role with stellar mass and galaxy type.},

During the last two decades, many observational studies were performed to prove the old and relaxed state of fossil systems. The majority of these studies that spans a wide range of topics including halos global scaling relations, dynamical substructures, stellar populations, and galaxy luminosity functions seem to challenge this scenario. The general picture that can be obtained by reviewing all the observational works is that the fossil state could be transitional. Indeed, the formation of the large magnitude gap observed in fossil systems could be related to internal processes rather than an old formation.},

abstract = {We present a model for star formation and supernova feedback that describes the multiphase structure of star-forming gas on scales that are typically not resolved in cosmological simulations. Our approach includes radiative heating and cooling, the growth of cold clouds embedded in an ambient hot medium, star formation in these clouds, feedback from supernovae in the form of thermal heating and cloud evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal enrichment. Implemented using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, our scheme is a significantly modified and extended version of the grid-based method of Yepes et al., and enables us to achieve a high dynamic range in simulations of structure formation. We discuss properties of the feedback model in detail and show that it predicts a selfregulated, quiescent mode of star formation, which, in particular, stabilizes the star-forming gaseous layers of disc galaxies. The parametrization of this mode can be reduced to a single free quantity that determines the overall time-scale for star formation. We fix this parameter numerically to match the observed rates of star formation in local disc galaxies. When normalized in this manner, cosmological simulations employing our model nevertheless overproduce the observed cosmic abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated to extend our feedback model to include galactic winds associated with star formation. Using small-scale simulations of individual star-forming disc galaxies, we show that these winds produce either galactic fountains or outflows, depending on the depth of the gravitational potential. In low-mass haloes, winds can greatly suppress the overall efficiency of star formation. When incorporated into cosmological simulations, our combined model for star formation and winds predicts a cosmic star formation density that is consistent with observations, provided that the winds are sufficiently energetic. Moreover, outflows from galaxies in these simulations drive chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium - in principle, accounting for the presence of metals in the Lyman $\alpha$ forest.},

abstract = {We study the red sequence in a cluster of galaxies at z = 1.62 and follow its evolution over the intervening 9.5Gyr to the present day. Using deep YJKs imaging with the HAWK-I instrument on the Very Large Telescope, we identify a tight red sequence and construct its rest-frame i-band luminosity function (LF). There is a marked deficit of faint red galaxies in the cluster that causes a turnover in the LF. We compare the red-sequence LF to that for clusters at z < 0.8, correcting the luminosities for passive evolution. The shape of the cluster red-sequence LF does not evolve between z = 1.62 and z = 0.6 but at z < 0.6 the faint population builds up significantly. Meanwhile, between z = 1.62 and 0.6 the inferred total light on the red sequence grows by a factor of 2 and the bright end of the LF becomes more populated. We construct a simple model for red-sequence evolution that grows the red sequence in total luminosity and matches the constant LF shape at z > 0.6. In this model the cluster accretes blue galaxies from the field whose star formation is quenched and who are subsequently allowed to merge. We find that three to four mergers among cluster galaxies during the 4Gyr between z = 1.62 and z = 0.6 match the observed LF evolution between the two redshifts. The inferred merger rate is consistent with other studies of this cluster. Our result supports the picture that galaxy merging during the major growth phase of massive clusters is an important process in shaping the red-sequence population at all luminosities.{\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {We apply the spectral energy distribution-fitting code ProSpect to multiwavelength imaging for $\sim$7,000 galaxies from the GAMA survey at $z<0.06$, in order to extract their star-formation histories. We combine a parametric description of the star formation history with a closed-box evolution of metallicity where the present-day gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy is a free parameter. We show with this approach that we are able to recover the observationally-determined cosmic star formation history (CSFH), an indication that stars are being formed in the correct epoch of the Universe, on average, for the manner in which we are conducting SED fitting. We also show the contribution to the CSFH of galaxies of different present-day visual morphologies, and stellar masses. This analysis suggests that half of the mass in present-day elliptical galaxies was in place 11 Gyr ago, whereas in other morphological types the stellar mass formed later, up to 6 Gyr ago for present-day irregular galaxies. Similarly, the most massive galaxies in our sample were shown to have formed half their stellar mass by 10.5 Gyr ago, whereas the least massive galaxies formed half their stellar mass as late as 4 Gyr ago (the well-known effect of "galaxy downsizing"). Finally, our metallicity approach allows us to follow the average evolution in gas-phase metallicity for populations of galaxies, and extract the evolution of the cosmic metal mass density in stars and in gas, producing results in broad agreement with observations of metal densities in the Universe.},

@article{Carnall2019,
abstract = {Parametric models for galaxy star-formation histories (SFHs) are widely used, though they are known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), star-formation-rate density (SFRD) and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal and double power law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star-formation rates (sSFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, SFR and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3 and 0.2 dex respectively. However the biases with respect to the true values depend more on the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and SFRs at redshift, $z\sim0.05$ are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at $z\sim0.4$, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use of parametric SFH models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion paper we consider non-parametric SFH models.},

It consists of science-grade optical datacubes for the first 100 of eventually 600 nearby (0.005 < z < 0.03) galaxies, obtained with the integral-field spectrograph PMAS/PPak mounted on the 3.5 m telescope at the Calar Alto observatory. The galaxies in DR1 already cover a wide range of properties in color-magnitude space, morphological type, stellar mass, and gas ionization conditions. This offers the potential to tackle a variety of open questions in galaxy evolution using spatially resolved spectroscopy. Two different spectral setups are available for each galaxy, (i) a low-resolution V500 setup covering the nominal wavelength range 3745-7500 {\AA} with a spectral resolution of 6.0 {\AA} (FWHM), and (ii) a medium-resolution V1200 setup covering the nominal wavelength range 3650-4840 {\AA} with a spectral resolution of 2.3 {\AA} (FWHM). We present the characteristics and data structure of the CALIFA datasets that should be taken into account for scientific exploitation of the data, in particular the effects of vignetting, bad pixels and spatially correlated noise. The data quality test for all 100 galaxies showed that we reach a median limiting continuum sensitivity of 1.0 × 10-18 erg s-1 cm-2 {\AA}-1 arcsec-2 at 5635 {\AA} and 2.2 × 10 -18 erg s-1 cm-2 {\AA}-1 arcsec-2 at 4500 {\AA} for the V500 and V1200 setup respectively, which corresponds to limiting r and g band surface brightnesses of 23.6 mag arcsec-2 and 23.4 mag arcsec-2, or an unresolved emission-line flux detection limit of roughly 1 × 10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2 and 0.6 × 10 -17 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2, respectively.

These formation ages of {\textless} 1 Gyr prior to observation are consistent with ages derived from measurements of Dn(4000) and EW0(H$\backslash$delta). Rapid quenching followed these bursty star-forming periods, generally occurring less than 350 Myr before observation, resulting in post-starburst SEDs and spectra for half the sample. The rapid formation timescales are consistent with the extreme star formation rates observed in 4 {\textless} z {\textless} 7 dusty starbursts observed with ALMA, suggesting that such dusty galaxies are progenitors of these UMGs. While such formation histories have been suggested in previous studies, the large sample introduced here presents the most compelling evidence yet that vigorous star formation followed by rapid quenching is almost certainly the norm for high mass galaxies in the early universe. The UMGs presented here were selected to be brighter than Ks = 21.7 raising the intriguing possibility that even (fainter) older quiescent UMGs could exist at this epoch.},

We focus on the luminosity of the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[O III]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong U$\delta$ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [O III] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [O III] luminosities.},

abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semi-analytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q{\_}z, that provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not "trained" on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public datasets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields we find a 1-sigma scatter in dz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

abstract = {Although variations in elemental abundance ratios in the Milky Way Galaxy certainly exist, details remain uncertain, particularly in the inner Galaxy, where stars and H II regions in the Galactic plane are obscured optically. In this paper we revisit two previously studied, inner Galaxy H II regions: G333.6-0.2 and W43. We observed three new positions in G333.6-0.2 with the Kuiper Airborne Observatory and reobserved the central position with the Infrared Space Observatory's Long Wavelength Spectrometer in far-infrared lines of S++, N++, N+, and O++. We also added the N+ lines at 122 and 205 micron to the suite of lines measured in W43 by Simpson et al. (1995). The measured electron densities range from $\sim$40 to over 4000 cm-3 in a single H II region, indicating that abundance analyses must consider density variations, since the critical densities of the observed lines range from 40 to 9000 cm-3. We propose a method to handle density variations and make new estimates of the S/H and N/H abundance ratios. We find that our sulfur abundance estimates for G333.6-0.2 and W43 agree with the S/H abundance ratios expected for the S/H abundance gradient previously reported by Simpson et al. The estimated N/H, S/H, and N/S ratios are the most reliable because of their small corrections for unseen ionization states. We compute models of the two H II regions to estimate corrections for the other unseen ionization states. We discuss these predictions and conclude that only a few of the latest models adequately reproduce H II region observations, including the well-known, relatively-large observed Ne++/O++ ratios in low- and moderate-excitation H II regions.},

The cluster galaxies (37) are part of a confirmed system at z=2.095 and the field galaxies (53) are at $1.9<z<2.4$; all are in the COSMOS legacy field. There is no statistical difference between H$\alpha$-emitting cluster and field populations when comparing their star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), galaxy size ($r_{eff}$), SFR surface density [$\Sigma$(H$\alpha_{star}$)], and stellar age distributions. The only difference is that at fixed stellar mass, the H$\alpha$-emitting cluster galaxies are $\log(r_{eff})\sim0.1$ larger than in the field. Approximately 19 of the H$\alpha$-emitters in the cluster and 26 in the field are IR-luminous ($L_{IR}>2\times10^{11} L_{\odot}$). Because the LIRGs in our combined sample are $\sim5$ times more massive than the low-IR galaxies, their radii are. To track stellar growth, we separate galaxies into those that lie above, on, and below the H$\alpha$ star-forming main sequence (SFMS) using $\Delta$SFR$(M_{\star})=\pm0.2$ dex. Galaxies above the SFMS (starbursts) tend to have higher H$\alpha$ SFR surface densities and younger light-weighted stellar ages compared to galaxies below the SFMS. Our results indicate that starbursts (+SFMS) in the cluster and field at $z\sim2$ are growing their stellar cores. Lastly, we compare to the (SFR-$M_{\star}$) relation from RHAPSODY cluster simulations and find the predicted slope is nominally consistent with the observations. However, the predicted cluster SFRs tend to be too low by a factor of $\sim2$ which seems to be a common problem for simulations across environment.},

High-redshift MOSDEF galaxies are offset towards lower [SII]6717,6731/Ha at fixed [OIII]5007/Hb, relative to local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Furthermore, at fixed [OIII]5007/Hb, local SDSS galaxies follow a trend of decreasing [SII]6717,6731/Ha as the surface density of star formation (Sigma_SFR) increases. We explain this trend in terms of the decreasing fractional contribution from diffuse ionized gas (f_DIG) as Sigma_SFR increases in galaxies, which causes galaxy-integrated line ratios to shift towards the locus of pure HII-region emission. The z$\sim$0 relationship between f_DIG and Sigma_SFR implies that high-redshift galaxies have lower f_DIG values than typical local systems, given their significantly higher typical Sigma_SFR. When an appropriate low-redshift benchmark with zero or minimal f_DIG is used, high-redshift MOSDEF galaxies appear offset towards higher [SII]6717,6731/Ha and/or [OIII]5007/Hb. The joint shifts of high-redshift galaxies in the [SII] and [NII] BPT diagrams are best explained in terms of the harder spectra ionizing their star-forming regions at fixed nebular oxygen abundance (expected for chemically-young galaxies), as opposed to large variations in N/O ratios or higher ionization parameters. The evolving mixture of HII regions and DIG is an essential ingredient to our description of the ISM over cosmic time.},

abstract = {We present in this paper a detailed analysis of the effect of environment on the star formation activity of galaxies within the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We have used the H emission line to derive the star formation rate (SFR) for each galaxy within a volume-limited sample of 8598 galaxies with 0:05 z 0:095 and Mðr {\~{A}} Þ {\`{A}}20:45. We find that the SFR of galaxies is strongly correlated with the local (projected) galaxy density, and thus we present here a density-SFR relation that is analogous to the density-morphology relation. The effect of density on the SFR of galaxies is seen in three ways. First, the overall distribution of SFRs is shifted to lower values in dense environments compared with the field population. Second, the effect is most noticeable for the strongly star-forming galaxies (H EW > 5 A ˚) in the 75th percentile of the SFR distribution. Third, there is a '' break '' (or characteristic density) in the density-SFR relation at a local galaxy density of To understand this break further, we have studied the SFR of galaxies as a function of clustercentric radius from 17 clusters and groups objectively selected from the SDSS EDR data. The distribution of SFRs of cluster galaxies begins to change, compared with the field population, at a clustercentric radius of 3-4 virial radii (at the >1 statistical significance), which is consistent with the characteristic break in density that we observe in the density-SFR relation. This effect with clus-tercentric radius is again most noticeable for the most strongly star-forming galaxies. Our tests suggest that the density-morphology relation alone is unlikely to explain the density-SFR relation we observe. For example , we have used the (inverse) concentration index of SDSS galaxies to classify late-type galaxies and show that the distribution of the star-forming (EW H > 5 A ˚) late-type galaxies is different in dense regions (within 2 virial radii) compared with similar galaxies in the field. However, at present, we are unable to make definitive statements about the independence of the density-morphology and density-SFR relation. We have tested our work against potential systematic uncertainties including stellar absorption, reddening, SDSS survey strategy, SDSS analysis pipelines, and aperture bias. Our observations are in qualitative agreement with recent simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation that predict a decrease in the SFR of galaxies within the virial radius. Our results are in agreement with recent 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey results as well as consistent with previous observations of a decrease in the SFR of galaxies in the cores of distant clusters. Taken together, these works demonstrate that the decrease in SFR of galaxies in dense environments is a universal phenomenon over a wide range in density (from 0.08 to 10 h {\`{A}}2 75 Mpc {\`{A}}2) and redshift (out to z ' 0:5).},

abstract = {We study the environmental dependence of color, stellar mass, and morphology by comparing galaxies in a forming cluster to those in the field at z = 1.6 with Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared imaging in the CANDELS/UDS field. We quantify the morphology of the galaxies using the effective radius, r eff, and S{\'{e}}rsic index, n. In both the cluster and field, approximately half of the bulge-dominated galaxies (n > 2) reside on the red sequence of the color-magnitude diagram, and most disk-dominated galaxies (n < 2) have colors expected for star-forming galaxies. There is weak evidence that cluster galaxies have redder rest-frame U-B colors and higher stellar masses compared to the field. Star-forming galaxies in both the cluster and field show no significant differences in their morphologies. In contrast, there is evidence that quiescent galaxies in the cluster have larger median effective radii and smaller S{\'{e}}rsic indices compared to the field with a significance of 2$\sigma$. These differences are most pronounced for galaxies at clustercentric distances 1 Mpc <Rproj < 1.5 Mpc, which have low S{\'{e}}rsic indices and possibly larger effective radii, more consistent with star-forming galaxies at this epoch and in contrast to other quiescent galaxies. We argue that star-forming galaxies are processed under the influence of the cluster environment at distances greater than the cluster-halo virial radius. Our results are consistent with models where gas accretion onto these galaxies is suppressed from processes associated with the cluster environment. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {The transformations taking place in late-type galaxies in the environment of rich clusters of galaxies at z=0 are reviewed. From the handful of late-type galaxies that inhabit local clusters, whether they were formed in-situ and survived as such, avoiding transformation or even destruction or if they are newcomers that recently infall from outside, we can learn an important lesson on the latest stages of galaxy evolution. We start by reviewing the observational scenario, covering the broadest possible stretch of the electromagnetic spectrum, from the gas tracers, the star formation tracers, the old star tracers and the dust. Strong emphasis is given to the three nearby, well studied clusters Virgo, A1367 and Coma, representative of different evolutionary stages, from unrelaxed, spiral rich (Virgo) to relaxed, spiral poor clusters (Coma). We continue by providing a review of models of galaxy interactions relevant to clusters of galaxies. Prototypes of various mechanisms and processes are discussed and their typical time-scales are given in an Appendix. Observations indicate the presence of healthy late-type galaxies falling into nearby clusters individually or belonging to massive groups. More rare are infalling galaxies belonging to compact groups where significant pre-processing might take place. Once entered the cluster, they loose their gas and quench their star formation activity, becoming anemics. Observations and theory agree in indicating that the interaction with the intergalactic medium is responsible for the gas depletion. This process, however, cannot be at the origin of the cluster lenticular galaxy population. Physical and statistical properties of S0 in nearby clusters and at higher redshift, indicate that they originate from spiral galaxies transformed by gravitational interactions.},

abstract = {Present-day clusters are massive halos containing mostly quiescent galaxies, while distant protoclusters are extended structures containing numerous star-forming galaxies. We investigate the implications of this fundamental change in a cosmological context using a set of N-body simulations and semi-analytic models. We find that the fraction of the cosmic volume occupied by all (proto)clusters increases by nearly three orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=7. We show that (proto)cluster galaxies are an important, and even dominant population at high redshift, as their expected contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density rises (from 1 at z=2 and 50 Protoclusters thus provide a significant fraction of the cosmic ionizing photons, and may have been crucial in driving the timing and topology of cosmic reionization. Internally, the average history of cluster formation can be described by three distinct phases: at z$\sim$10-5, galaxy growth in protoclusters proceeded in an inside-out manner, with centrally dominant halos that are among the most active regions in the Universe; at z$\sim$5-1.5, rapid star formation occurred within the entire 10-20 Mpc structures, forming most of their present-day stellar mass; at z<$\sim$1.5, violent gravitational collapse drove these stellar contents into single cluster halos, largely erasing the details of cluster galaxy formation due to relaxation and virialization. Our results motivate observations of distant protoclusters in order to understand the rapid, extended stellar growth during Cosmic Noon, and their connection to reionization during Cosmic Dawn.},

abstract = { Context. The evolution of galaxies depends on their interaction with the surrounding environment. Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) have been found in large numbers in clusters. We detected a few star-forming blobs in the VESTIGE survey, located at ∼5 kpc from a UDG, namely NGVS 3543, in association with an HI gas cloud AGC 226178, suggesting a recent interaction between this low-surface-brightness system and the surrounding cluster environment.  Aims. We use a complete set of multi-frequency data including deep optical, UV, and narrow-band H $\alpha$ imaging and HI data to understand the formation process that gave birth to this peculiar system.  Methods. For this purpose, we measured (i) the multi-wavelength radial surface brightness profiles of NGVS 3543 and compared them to the predictions of spectro-photometric models of galaxy evolution in rich clusters; and (ii) the aperture photometry of the blue regions in the vicinity of NGVS 3543 in order to determine their age and stellar mass.  Results. Comparisons of the observations with evolutionary models indicate that NGVS 3543 has undergone a ram-pressure stripping that peaked ∼100 Myr ago, transforming a blue gas-rich UDG into a red gas-poor UDG. Star formation has taken place in the ram pressure stripped gas, the mass of which is ∼10 8 M ⊙ , forming star complexes with a typical age of ∼20 Myr and a stellar mass of ∼10 4 M ⊙ .  Conclusions. These results suggest that we are observing for the first time the ongoing transformation of a gas-rich UDG into a red and quiescent UDG under the effect of a ram-pressure stripping event. The same process could explain the lack of star-forming UDGs in rich environments observed in several nearby clusters. },

abstract = {The final product of galaxy evolution through cosmic time is the population of galaxies in the local universe. These galaxies are also those that can be studied in most detail, thus providing a stringent benchmark for our understanding of galaxy evolution. Through the huge success of spectroscopic single-fiber, statistical surveys of the Local Universe in the last decade, it has become clear, however, that an authoritative observational description of galaxies will involve measuring their spatially resolved properties over their full optical extent for a statistically significant sample. We present here the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey, which has been designed to provide a first step in this direction. We summarize the survey goals and design, including sample selection and observational strategy. We also showcase the data taken during the first observing runs (June/July 2010) and outline the reduction pipeline, quality control schemes and general characteristics of the reduced data. This survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopic information of a diameter selected sample of ∼600 galaxies in the Local Universe (0.005 < z < 0.03). CALIFA has been designed to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the following quantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas: distribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematic properties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. CALIFA uses the PPAK integral field unit (IFU), with a hexagonal field-of-view of ∼1.3 ′, with a factor by adopting a three-pointing dithering scheme. The optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000 {\AA}, using two overlapping setups (V500 and V1200), with different resolutions: R ∼ 850 and R ∼ 1650, respectively. CALIFA is a legacy survey, intended for the community. The reduced data will be released, once the quality has been guaranteed. The analyzed data fulfillthe expectations of the original observing proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratory analysis: (i) the final datacubes reach a 3$\sigma$ limiting surface brightness depth of ∼23.0 mag/arcsec 2 for the V500 grating data (∼22.8 mag/arcsec 2 for V1200); (ii) about of the covered field-of-view is above this 3$\sigma$ limit; (iii) the data have a blue-to-red relative flux calibration within a few percent in most of the wavelength range; (iv) the absolute flux calibration is accurate within ∼8 with respect to SDSS; (v) the measured spectral resolution is ∼85 km s -1 for V1200 (∼150 km s -1 for V500); (vi) the estimated accuracy of the wavelength calibration is ∼5 km s -1 for the V1200 data (∼10 km s -1 for the V500 data); (vii) the aperture matched CALIFA and SDSS spectra are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Finally, we show that we are able to carry out all measurements indicated above, recovering the properties of the stellar populations, the ionized gas andthe kinematics of both components. The associated maps illustrate the spatial variation of these parameters across the field, reemphasizing the redshift dependence of single aperture spectroscopic measurements. We conclude from this first look at the data that CALIFA will be an important resource for archaeological studies of galaxies in the Local Universe. {\textcopyright} 2012 ESO.},

abstract = {We analyse a z < 0.1 galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey focusing on the variation in the galaxy colour bimodality with stellar mass M and projected neighbour density $\sigma$, and on measurements of the galaxy stellar mass functions. The characteristic mass increases with environmental density from about 10 10.6 to 10 10.9 M ⊙ (Kroupa initial mass function, H 0 = 70) for $\sigma$ in the range 0.1-10 Mpc -2. The galaxy population naturally divides into a red and blue sequence with the locus of the sequences in colour-mass and colour-concentration indices not varying strongly with environment. The fraction of galaxies on the red sequence is determined in bins of 0.2 in log $\sigma$ and log M (12 × 13 bins). The red fraction f r generally increases continuously in both $\sigma$ and M such that there is a unified relation: f r = F($\sigma$, M). Two simple functions are proposed which provide good fits to the data. These data are compared with analogous quantities in semi-analytical models based on the Millennium N-body simulation: the Bower et al. and Croton et al. models that incorporate active galactic nucleus feedback. Both models predict a strong dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and environment that is qualitatively similar to the observations. However, a quantitative comparison shows that the Bower et al. model is a significantly better match; this appears to be due to the different treatment of feedback in central galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {Galaxy surveys have suggested that rapid and sustained decrease in the star-formation rate (SFR), "quenching", in massive disk galaxies is frequently related to the presence of a bar. Optical and near-IR observations reveal that nearly 60 of disk galaxies in the local universe are barred, thus it is important to understand the relationship between bars and star formation in disk galaxies. Recent observational results imply that the Milky Way quenched about 9-10 Gyr ago, at the transition between the cessation of the growth of the kinematically hot, old, metal-poor thick disk and the kinematically colder, younger, and more metal-rich thin disk. Although perhaps coincidental, the quenching episode could also be related to the formation of the bar. Indeed the transfer of energy from the large-scale shear induced by the bar to increasing turbulent energy could stabilize the gaseous disk against wide-spread star formation and quench the galaxy. To explore the relation between bar formation and star formation in gas rich galaxies quantitatively, we simulated gas-rich disk isolated galaxies. Our simulations include prescriptions for star formation, stellar feedback, and for regulating the multi-phase interstellar medium. We find that the action of stellar bar efficiently quenches star formation, reducing the star-formation rate by a factor of ten in less than 1 Gyr. Analytical and self-consistent galaxy simulations with bars suggest that the action of the stellar bar increases the gas random motions within the co-rotation radius of the bar. Indeed, we detect an increase in the gas velocity dispersion up to 20-35 km s-1 at the end of the bar formation phase. The star-formation efficiency decreases rapidly, and in all of our models, the bar quenches the star formation in the galaxy. The star-formation efficiency is much lower in simulated barred compared to unbarred galaxies and more rapid bar formation implies more rapid quenching.},

abstract = {Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined, and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere fluxes are now very realistic, and synthetic photometry offers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.

abstract = {In the six billion years between redshifts z=1 and z=0.1, galaxies change due to the aging of their stellar populations, the formation of new stars, and mergers with other galaxies. Here I explore the relative importance of these various effects, finding that while mergers are likely to be important for the red galaxy sequence they are unlikely to affect more than 10of the blue galaxy sequence. I compare the galaxy population at redshift z=0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to that at z=1 from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2. Galaxies are bluer at z=1: the blue sequence by about 0.3 mag and the red sequence by about 0.1 mag, in redshift z=0.1 (u-g) color. I evaluate the change in color and in the luminosity functions of the two sequences using some simplistic stellar population synthesis models. These models indicate that the luminous end of the red sequence fades less than passive evolution allows by about 0.2 mag. Due to a lack of luminous blue progenitors, ``dry'' mergers betweeen red galaxies then must create the luminous red population at z=0.1, if stellar population models are correct. The blue sequence colors and luminosity function are consistent with a reduction in the star-formation rate since redshift z=1 by a factor of about three, with no change in the number density to within 10 These results restrict the number of blue galaxies that can fall onto the red sequence by any process, and in particular suggest that if mergers are catastrophic events they must be rare for blue galaxies.},

We use spectroscopic data taken from the CALIFA data release 3 (DR3) and theoretical (for Teff and U) and empirical (for O/H) calibrations based on strong emission lines. We consider the spatial distribution and radial gradients of these parameters in each galactic disc for the objects in our sample. Most of the galaxies in our sample (∼70 per cent) show positive Teff radial gradients, although some exhibit negative or flat ones. The median value of the Teff radial gradient is 0.762 kK/R25. We find that the radial gradients of both logUand Teff depend on the oxygen abundance gradient, in the sense that the gradient of logU increases as the log(O/H) gradient increases while there is an anti-correlation between the gradient of Teff and the oxygen abundance gradient. Moreover, galaxies with flat oxygen abundance gradients tend to have flat logU and Teff gradients as well. Although our results are in agreement with the idea of the existence of positive Teff gradients along the disc of the majority of spiral galaxies, it seems that this is not a universal property for these objects.},

We show, for the first time, that while the [OIII]/Hb and [OIII]/[OII] ratios rise, the [NII]/H-alpha and [SII]/H-alpha ratios fall significantly over the 0.2<z<0.35 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.2<log(M/Msun)<10.6. The [OIII]/H-beta and [OIII]/[OII] ratios continue to rise across the full 0.2<z<0.6 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.8<log(M/Msun)<10.0. We conclusively rule out AGN contamination, a changing ISM pressure, and a change in the hardness of the EUV radiation field as the cause of the change in the line ratios between 0.2<z<0.35. We find that the ionization parameter rises significantly with redshift (by 0.1 to 0.25 dex depending on the stellar mass of the sample). We show that the ionization parameter is strongly correlated with the fraction of young-to-old stars, as traced by the H-beta equivalent width. We discuss the implications of this result on higher redshift studies, and we consider the implications on the use of standard optical metallicity diagnostics at high redshift.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We characterise a massive proto-cluster at z=2.895 that we found in the COSMOS field using the spectroscopic sample of the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS). This is one of the rare structures at z$\sim$3 not identified around AGNs or radio galaxies, so it is an ideal laboratory to study galaxy formation in dense environments. The structure comprises 12 galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshift in an area of 7'x8', in a z bin of Dz=0.016. The measured galaxy number overdensity is delta_g=12+/-2. This overdensity has total mass of M$\sim$8.1x10^(14)M_sun in a volume of 13x15x17 Mpc^3. Simulations indicate that such an overdensity at z$\sim$2.9 is a proto-cluster that will collapse in a cluster of total mass M$\sim$2.5x10^(15)M_sun at z=0. We compare the properties of the galaxies within the overdensity with a control sample at the same z but outside the overdensity. We did not find any statistically significant difference between the properties (stellar mass, SFR, sSFR, NUV-r, r-K) of the galaxies inside and outside the overdensity. The stacked spectrum of galaxies in the overdensity background shows a significant absorption feature at the wavelength of Lya redshifted at z=2.895 (lambda=4736 A), with a rest frame EW = 4+/- 1.4 A. Stacking only background galaxies without intervening sources at z$\sim$2.9 along their line of sight, we find that this absorption feature has a rest frame EW of 10.8+/-3.7 A, with a detection S/N of $\sim$4. These EW values imply a high column density (N(HI)$\sim$3-20x10^(19)cm^(-2)), consistent with a scenario where such absorption is due to intervening cold gas streams, falling into the halo potential wells of the proto-cluster galaxies. However, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that this absorption is due to the diffuse gas within the overdensity.},

abstract = {We present an overview and the first data release of ZFIRE, a spectroscopic redshift survey of star-forming galaxies that utilizes the MOSFIRE instrument on Keck-I to study galaxy properties in rich environments at $1.5<z<2.5$. ZFIRE measures accurate spectroscopic redshifts and basic galaxy properties derived from multiple emission lines. The galaxies are selected from a stellar mass limited sample based on deep near infra-red imaging ($\mathrm{K_{AB}<25}$) and precise photometric redshifts from the ZFOURGE and UKIDSS surveys as well as grism redshifts from 3DHST. Between 2013--2015 ZFIRE has observed the COSMOS and UDS legacy fields over 13 nights and has obtained 211 galaxy redshifts over $1.57<z<2.66$ from a combination of nebular emission lines (such as \Halpha, \NII, \Hbeta, \OII, \OIII, \SII) observed at 1--2\micron. Based on our medium-band NIR photometry, we are able to spectrophotometrically flux calibrate our spectra to \around10\% accuracy. ZFIRE reaches $5\sigma$ emission line flux limits of \around$\mathrm{3\times10^{-18}\simerg/s/cm^2}$ with a resolving power of $R=3500$ and reaches masses down to \around10$^{9}$\msol. We confirm that the primary input survey, ZFOURGE, has produced photometric redshifts for star-forming galaxies (including highly attenuated ones) accurate to $\Delta z/(1+z\mathrm{_{spec})}=0.015$ with $0.7\%$ outliers. We measure a slight redshift bias of $<0.001$, and we note that the redshift bias tends to be larger at higher masses. We also examine the role of redshift on the derivation of rest-frame colours and stellar population parameters from SED fitting techniques. The ZFIRE survey extends spectroscopically-confirmed $z\sim 2$ samples across a richer range of environments, here we make available the first public release of the data for use by the community.\footnote{\url{http://zfire.swinburne.edu.au}}},

ZFOURGE covers a total of $400\ \mathrm{arcmin}^2$ in cosmic fields CDFS, COSMOS and UDS, overlapping CANDELS. We present photometric catalogs comprising $>70,000$ galaxies, selected from ultradeep $K_s$-band detection images ($25.5-26.5$ AB mag, $5\sigma$, total), and $>80\%$ complete to $K_s<25.3-25.9$ AB. We use 5 near-IR medium-bandwidth filters ($J_1,J_2,J_3,H_s,H_l$) as well as broad-band $K_s$ at $1.05\ - 2.16\ \mu m$ to $25-26$ AB at a seeing of $\sim0.5$". Each field has ancillary imaging in $26-40$ filters at $0.3-8\ \mu m$. We derive photometric redshifts and stellar population properties. Comparing with spectroscopic redshifts indicates a photometric redshift uncertainty $\sigma_z={0.010,0.009}$, and 0.011 in CDFS, COSMOS, and UDS. As spectroscopic samples are often biased towards bright and blue sources, we also inspect the photometric redshift differences between close pairs of galaxies, finding $\sigma_{z,pairs}= 0.01-0.02$ at $1<z<2.5$. We quantify how $\sigma_{z,pairs}$ depends on redshift, magnitude, SED type, and the inclusion of FourStar medium bands. $\sigma_{z,pairs}$ is smallest for bright, blue star-forming samples, while red star-forming galaxies have the worst $\sigma_{z,pairs}$. Including FourStar medium bands reduces $\sigma_{z,pairs}$ by 50\% at $1.5<z<2.5$. We calculate SFRs based on ultraviolet and ultradeep far-IR $Spitzer$/MIPS and Herschel/PACS data. We derive rest-frame $U-V$ and $V-J$ colors, and illustrate how these correlate with specific SFR and dust emission to $z=3.5$. We confirm the existence of quiescent galaxies at $z\sim3$, demonstrating their SFRs are suppressed by $>\times15$.},

abstract = {The galaxy cluster CLG0218.3-0510 at z=1.62 is one of the most distant galaxy clusters known, with a rich muti-wavelength data set that confirms a mature galaxy population already in place. Using very deep, wide area (20x20 Mpc) imaging by Spitzer/MIPS at 24um, in conjunction with Herschel 5-band imaging from 100-500um, we investigate the dust-obscured, star-formation properties in the cluster and its associated large scale environment. Our galaxy sample of 693 galaxies at z=1.62 detected at 24um (10 spectroscopic and 683 photo-z) includes both cluster galaxies (i.e. within r <1 Mpc projected clustercentric radius) and field galaxies, defined as the region beyond a radius of 3 Mpc. The star-formation rates (SFRs) derived from the measured infrared luminosity range from 18 to 2500 Ms/yr, with a median of 55 Ms/yr, over the entire radial range (10 Mpc). The cluster brightest FIR galaxy, taken as the centre of the galaxy system, is vigorously forming stars at a rate of 256$\pm$70 Ms/yr, and the total cluster SFR enclosed in a circle of 1 Mpc is 1161$\pm$96 Ms/yr. We estimate a dust extinction of about 3 magnitudes by comparing the SFRs derived from [OII] luminosity with the ones computed from the 24um fluxes. We find that the in-falling region (1-3 Mpc) is special: there is a significant decrement (3.5x) of passive relative to star-forming galaxies in this region, and the total SFR of the galaxies located in this region is lower (130 Ms/yr/Mpc2) than anywhere in the cluster or field, regardless of their stellar mass. In a complementary approach we compute the local galaxy density, Sigma5, and find no trend between SFR and Sigma5. However, we measure an excess of star-forming galaxies in the cluster relative to the field by a factor 1.7, that lends support to a reversal of the SF-density relation in CLG0218.},

The observations span three galaxy clusters, derived from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-sequence Cluster Survey. We augment the >5sigma detections of the CO (2-1) fluxes with multi-band photometry, yielding stellar masses and infrared-derived star formation rates, to place some of the first constraints on molecular gas properties in z$\sim$1.6 cluster environments. We measure sizable gas reservoirs of 0.5-2x10^11 solar masses in these objects, with high gas fractions and long depletion timescales, averaging 62and 1.4 Gyr, respectively. We compare our cluster galaxies to the scaling relations of the coeval field, in the context of how gas fractions and depletion timescales vary with respect to the star-forming main sequence. We find that our cluster galaxies lie systematically off the field scaling relations at z=1.6 toward enhanced gas fractions, at a level of $\sim$4sigma, but have consistent depletion timescales. Exploiting CO detections in lower-redshift clusters from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the gas fraction in cluster galaxies, finding it to mimic the strong rise with redshift in the field. We emphasize the utility of detecting abundant gas-rich galaxies in high-redshift clusters, deeming them as crucial laboratories for future statistical studies.},

abstract = {Context. Very few z > 1.5 clusters of galaxies are currently known. It is important to study the properties of galaxies in these clusters and the intra-cluster medium and, furthermore, to cross-check the reliability of the various mass estimates. This will help to clarify the process of structure formation and how distant clusters may be used to constrain cosmology. Aims. We present a 84 ks Chandra observation of IRC-0218A, a cluster of galaxies inferred by the presence of a galaxy overdensity in the infrared at a redshift of 1.62 and associated with some XMM emission. Methods. We performed a spatial analysis of the Chandra X-ray photon distribution. Results. The Chandra observation of IRC-0218A appears to be entirely dominated by a point source located at the centroid of the mid-infrared galaxy density. In addition, we detected weak extended emission (2.3$\sigma$) out to a radius of 25′′ with a flux of $\sim$3 × 10 -15 erg s -1 cm -2 in the [0.3-2] keV band. Assuming that clusters evolve similarly, we infer a virial mass of M 200 = 7.7(±3.8) × 10 13 M ⊙. This is marginally compatible with our current estimate of the cluster dynamical mass (based on 10 redshifts), although there is no evidence that the galaxy peculiar velocities correspond to the motions of a virialized structure. The stellar mass enclosed in the inferred X-ray virial radius is estimated to be 1-2 × 10 12 M ⊙. We provide a detailed account of 28 X-ray point sources detected in the field. {\textcopyright} 2012 ESO.},

abstract = {We review the use of emission lines for understanding galaxy evolution, focusing on excitation source, metallicity, ionization parameter, ISM pressure, and electron density. We discuss the physics, benefits, and caveats of emission line diagnostics, including the effects of theoretical model uncertainties, diffuse ionized gas, and sample selection bias. In anticipation of upcoming telescope facilities, we provide new self-consistent emission line diagnostic calibrations for complete spectral coverage from the UV to the IR. These diagnostics can be used in concert to understand how fundamental galaxy properties have changed across cosmic time. We conclude the following: ▪ The UV, optical, and IR contain complementary diagnostics that can probe the conditions within different nebular ionization zones. ▪ Accounting for complex density gradients and temperature profiles is critical for reliably estimating the fundamental properties of Hii regions and galaxies. ▪ Diffuse ionized gas can raise metallicity estimates, flatten metallicity gradients, and introduce scatter in ionization parameter measurements. ▪ New 3D emission line diagnostics successfully separate the contributions from star formation, AGN, and shocks using integral field spectroscopy. We summarize with a discussion of the challenges and major opportunities for emission line diagnostics in the coming years.},

abstract = {We calculate stellarmasses for$\sim$400 000 massive luminous galaxies at redshift$\sim$0.2-0.7 using the first two years of data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energy distributions to u, g, r, i, z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies are used to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. Accurate BOSS spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. We find that the distribution of stellar masses in BOSS is narrow ($\delta$logM $\sim$ 0.5 dex) and peaks at about logM/M⊙ $\sim$ 11.3 (for a Kroupa initial stellar mass function), and that the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2-0.6, in agreement with the intended BOSS target selection. The galaxy masses probed by BOSS extend over $\sim$1012M⊙, providing unprecedented measurements of the high-mass end of the galaxy mass function. We find that the galaxy number density above $\sim$2.5 × 1011M⊙ agrees with previous determinations. We perform a comparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the BOSS target selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. The abundance of massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the BOSS data, but the models lack galaxies at the massive end. Moreover, no evolution with redshift is detected from $\sim$0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance of massive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. Additionally, BOSS data display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in the local Universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. On the other hand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span a narrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. We argue that the lack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly due to metallicity, which is too low in the models. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We investigate the star formation rate (SFR) dependence on the stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity relation at z=2 with MOSFIRE/Keck as part of the ZFIRE survey. We have identified 117 galaxies (1.98 < z < 2.56), with $8.9\leq$log(M/M$_{\odot}$)$\leq11.0$, for which we can measure gas-phase metallicities. For the first time, we show discernible difference between the mass-metallicity relation, using individual galaxies, when deviding the sample by low ($<10$$\sim$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) and high ($>10$$\sim$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) SFRs. At fixed mass, low star-forming galaxies tend to have higher metallicity than high star-forming galaxies. Using a few basic assumptions, we further show that the gas masses and metallicities required to produce the fundamental mass--metallicity relation, and its intrinsic scatter, are consistent with cold-mode accretion predictions obtained from the OWLS hydrodynamical simulations. Our results from both simulations and observations are suggestive that cold-mode accretion is responsible for the fundamental mass-metallicity relation at $z=2$ and demonstrates the direct relationship between cosmological accretion and the fundamental properties of galaxies.},

@article{Leja2019a,
abstract = {Nonparametric star formation histories (SFHs) have long promised to be the `gold standard' for galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling as they are flexible enough to describe the full diversity of SFH shapes, whereas parametric models rule out a significant fraction of these shapes {\it a priori}. However, this flexibility is not fully constrained even with high-quality observations, making it critical to choose a well-motivated prior. Here, we use the SED-fitting code \texttt{Prospector} to explore the effect of different nonparametric priors by fitting SFHs to mock UV-IR photometry generated from a diverse set of input SFHs. First, we confirm that nonparametric SFHs recover input SFHs with less bias and return more accurate errors than do parametric SFHs. We further find that, while nonparametric SFHs robustly recover the overall shape of the input SFH, the primary determinant of the size and shape of the posterior star formation rate (SFR) as a function of time is the choice of prior, rather than the photometric noise. As a practical demonstration, we fit the UV-IR photometry of $\sim$6000 galaxies from the GAMA survey and measure inter-prior scatters in mass (0.1 dex), SFR$_{100\; \mathrm{Myr}}$ (0.8 dex), and mass-weighted ages (0.2 dex), with the bluest star-forming galaxies showing the most sensitivity. An important distinguishing characteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for changes in SFR(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in bursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to (feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to (larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from SED-fitting. High-quality spectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed models of SFR(t).},

abstract = {We measure the rest-frame colors (dust-corrected), infrared luminosities, star formation rates, and stellar masses of 92 galaxies in a Spitzer-selected cluster at z = 1.62. By fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to 10-band photometry (0.4 $\mu$m<$\lambda$obs < 8 $\mu$m) and measuring 24 $\mu$m fluxes for the 12 spectroscopically confirmed and 80 photometrically selected members, we discover an exceptionally high level of star formation in the cluster core of $\sim$1700 M sun yr–1 Mpc–2. The cluster galaxies define a strong blue sequence in (U-V) color and span a range in color. We identify 17 members with L IR>1011 L sun, and these IR luminous members follow the same trend of increasing star formation with stellar mass that is observed in the field at z $\sim$ 2. Using rates derived from both the 24 $\mu$m imaging and SED fitting, we find that the relative fraction of star-forming members triples from the lowest to highest galaxy density regions; e.g., the IR luminous fraction increases from $\sim$8 at $\Sigma$ $\sim$ 10 gal Mpc–2 to $\sim$25 at $\Sigma$ >$\sim$ 100 gal Mpc–2. The observed increase is a reversal of the well-documented trend at z < 1 and signals that we have reached the epoch when massive cluster galaxies are still forming a substantial fraction of their stars. This work is based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under NASA contract 1407.

abstract = {Using observations from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE), we obtain the deepest measurements to date of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) at 0.2 < z < 3. ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2 $\mu$m. We combine this with Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses of 109.5 M at z ; 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z ≤ 1.5 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the SMF, leading to an upturn at masses <1010 M that is not well described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z 2 and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M*) and slope at the lowest masses ($\alpha$) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/M 10.65 and -1.5, respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. Our data allow us, for the first time, to observe a rapid buildup at the low-mass end of the quiescent SMF. Since z = 2.5, the total stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies (down to 109 M has increased by a factor of 12, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies only increases by a factor of 2.2. {\textcopyright} 2014.

abstract = {We present the results of spectroscopic studies with the LRIS spectrograph on Keck of two of the Hawaii deep survey fields. The 393 objects observed cover an area of 26.2 square arcmin and constitute a nearly complete sample down to K = 20, I = 23, and B = 24.5. The rest-frame K-band luminosity function and its evolution with redshift are described. Comparisons are made with other optically selected (B and I) samples in the literature, and the corresponding rest-frame B-band luminosity function evolution is presented. The B-band counts near B = 24 are shown to be a mixture of normal galaxies at modest redshifts and galaxies undergoing rapid star formation, which have a wide range of masses and which are spread over the redshift interval from z = 0.2 to beyond z = 1.7. The luminosity functions, number counts, and color distributions at optical and IR wavelengths are discussed in terms of a consistent picture of the star-forming history of the galaxy sample. [OII] emission-line diagnostics or rest-frame ultra-violet--infrared color information are used in combination with rest-frame absolute K magnitudes to construct a ``fundamental plane'' in which the evolution of the global star-formation rate with redshift can be shown, and we find that the maximum rest-frame K luminosity of galaxies undergoing rapid star formation has been declining smoothly with decreasing redshift from a value near L* at z > 1. This smooth decrease in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies dominated by star formation can simultaneously account for the high B-band galaxy counts at faint magnitudes and the redshift distribution at z < 1 in both the B- and K-selected samples. Finally, the overall K-band light density evolution is discussed as a tracer of the baryonic mass in stars and compared with the rate of star formation.},

abstract = {Using a set of 15 high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of Milky Way formation, we investigate the origin of the baryonic material found in stars at redshift zero. We find that roughly half of this material originates from subhalo/satellite systems and half is smoothly accreted from the intergalactic medium. About 90 per cent of all material has been ejected and re-accreted in galactic winds at least once. The vast majority of smoothly accreted gas enters into a galactic fountain that extends to a median galactocentric distance of ∼20 kpc with a median recycling time-scale of ∼500 Myr. We demonstrate that, in most cases, galactic fountains acquire angular momentum via mixing of low angular momentum, wind-recycled gas with high angular momentum gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Prograde mergers boost this activity by helping to align the disc and CGM rotation axes, whereas retrograde mergers cause the fountain to lose angular momentum. Fountain flows that promote angular momentum growth are conducive to smooth evolution on tracks quasi-parallel to the disc sequence of the stellar mass-specific angular momentum plane, whereas retrograde minor mergers, major mergers, and bar-driven secular evolution move galaxies towards the bulge sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that fountain flows act to flatten and narrow the radial metallicity gradient and metallicity dispersion of disc stars, respectively. Thus, the evolution of galactic fountains depends strongly on the cosmological merger history and is crucial for the chemodynamical evolution of Milky-Way-sized disc galaxies.},

MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates "on-the-fly" from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's development.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to set constraints of the epochs of early-type galaxy formation through the 'archaeology' of the stellar populations in local galaxies. Using our models of absorption line indices that account for variable abundance ratios, we derive the stellar population parameters of 124 early-type galaxies in high and low density environments. We find that all three parameters age, metallicity, and alpha/Fe ratio are correlated with velocity dispersion. We further find evidence for an influence of the environment on the stellar population properties. Massive early-type galaxies in low-density environments appear on average $\sim$2 Gyrs younger and slightly more metal-rich than their counterparts in high density environments. No offsets in the alpha/Fe ratios, instead, are detected. We translate the derived ages and alpha/Fe ratios into star formation histories. We show that most star formation activity in early-type galaxies is expected to have happened between redshifts 3 and 5 in high density and between redshifts 1 and 2 in low density environments. We conclude that at least 50 per cent of the total stellar mass density must have already formed at z 1, in good agreement with observational estimates of the total stellar mass density as a function of redshift. Our results suggest that significant mass growth in the early-type galaxy population below z 1 must be restricted to less massive objects, and a significant increase of the stellar mass density between redshifts 1 and 2 should be present caused mainly by the field galaxy population. The results of this paper further imply vigorous star formation episodes in massive objects at z 2-5 and the presence of evolved ellipticals around z 1, both observationally identified as SCUBA galaxies and EROs.},

abstract = {A new harassment model is presented that models the complex and dynamical tidal field of a Virgo-like galaxy cluster. The model is applied to small, late-type dwarf disc galaxies (of substantially lower mass than in previous harassment simulations) as they infall into the cluster from the outskirts. These dwarf galaxies are only mildly affected by high-speed tidal encounters with little or no observable consequences; typical stellar losses are <10 per cent, producing very low surface brightness streams ( mag arcsec-2) and a factor of 2 drop in dynamical mass-to-light ratio. Final stellar discs remain disc like, and dominated by rotation although often with tidally induced spiral structure. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, the statistically likely influences of harassment on infalling dwarf galaxies are determined. The effects of harassment are found to be highly dependent on the orbit of the galaxy within the cluster, such that newly accreted dwarf galaxies typically suffer only mild harassment. Strong tidal encounters, that can morphologically transform discs into spheroidals, are rare occurring in <15 per cent of dwarf galaxy infalls for typical orbits of substructure within cold dark matter cluster mass haloes. For orbits with small apocentric distances (<250 kpc), harassment is significantly stronger resulting is in complete disruption or heavy mass loss (>90 per cent dark matter and >50 per cent stellar), however, such orbits are expected to be highly improbable for newly infalling galaxies due to the deep potential well of the cluster. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Distant galaxies show correlations between their current star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses, implying that their star formation histories (SFHs) are highly similar. Moreover, observations show that the ultraviolet luminosities and stellar masses grow from z= 8 to 3, implying that the SFRs increase with time. We compare the cosmologically averaged evolution in galaxies at 3 < z < 8 at constant comoving number density, n= 2 × 10-4Mpc-3. This allows us to study the evolution of stellar mass and star formation in the galaxy predecessors and descendants in ways not possible using galaxies selected at constant stellar mass or SFR, quantities that themselves evolve strongly in time. We show that the cosmologically averaged SFRs of these galaxies increase smoothly from z= 8 to 3 as $\Psi$(t) ∼t$\alpha$ with $\alpha$= 1.7 ± 0.2. This conflicts with assumptions that the SFR is either constant or declines exponentially in time. Furthermore, we show that the stellar mass growth in these galaxies is consistent with this derived SFH. This provides evidence that the slope of the high-mass end of the initial mass function is approximately Salpeter unless the duty cycle of star formation is much less than unity. We argue that these relations follow from gas accretion (either through accretion or delivered by mergers) coupled with galaxy disc growth under the assumption that the SFR depends on the local gas surface density. This predicts that gas fractions decrease from z= 8 to 3 on average as fgas∼ (1 +z)0.9 for galaxies with this number density. The implied galaxy gas accretion rates at z > 4 are as fast and may even exceed the SFR: this is the 'gas accretion epoch'. At z < 4 the SFR overtakes the implied gas accretion rate, indicating a period where galaxies consume gas faster than it is acquired. At z≲ 3, galaxies with this number density depart from these relations implying that star formation and gas accretion are slowed at later times. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2010 RAS.},

abstract = {We present the spatially resolved H$\alpha$ dynamics of 16 star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 0.81 using the new KMOS multi-object integral field spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope. These galaxies, selected using 1.18 $\mu$m narrowband imaging from the 10 deg2 CFHT-HiZELS survey of the SA 22 hr field, are found in a ∼4 Mpc overdensity of H$\alpha$ emitters and likely reside in a group/intermediate environment, but not a cluster. We confirm and identify a rich group of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.813 ± 0.003, with 13 galaxies within 1000 km s-1 of each other, and seven within a diameter of 3 Mpc. All of our galaxies are "typical" star-forming galaxies at their redshift, 0.8 ± 0.4 SFR, spanning a range of specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of 0.2-1.1 Gyr-1 and have a median metallicity very close to solar of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.62 ± 0.06. We measure the spatially resolved H$\alpha$ dynamics of the galaxies in our sample and show that 13 out of 16 galaxies can be described by rotating disks and use the data to derive inclination corrected rotation speeds of 50-275 km s -1. The fraction of disks within our sample is 75% ± 8%, consistent with previous results based on Hubble Space Telescope morphologies of H$\alpha$-selected galaxies at z ∼ 1 and confirming that disks dominate the SFR density at z ∼ 1. Our H$\alpha$ galaxies are well fitted by the z ∼ 1-2 Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, confirming the evolution seen in the zero point. Apart from having, on average, higher stellar masses and lower sSFRs, our group galaxies at z = 0.81 present the same mass-metallicity and TF relation as z ∼ 1 field galaxies and are all disk galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {We study the effects of local environment and stellar mass on galaxy properties using a mass complete sample of quiescent and star-forming systems in the COSMOS field at $z\lesssim$ 3. We show that at $z\lesssim$ 1, the median star-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR) of all galaxies depend on environment, but they become independent of environment at $z\gtrsim$ 1. However, we find that only for \textit{star-forming} galaxies, the median SFR and sSFR are similar in different environments, regardless of redshift and stellar mass. We find that the quiescent fraction depends on environment at $z\lesssim$ 1, and on stellar mass out to $z\sim$ 3. We show that at $z\lesssim$ 1, galaxies become quiescent faster in denser environments and that the overall environmental quenching efficiency increases with cosmic time. Environmental and mass quenching processes depend on each other. At $z\lesssim$ 1, denser environments more efficiently quench galaxies with higher masses (log($M/M_{\odot}$)$\gtrsim$ 10.7), possibly due to a higher merger rate of massive galaxies in denser environments, and that mass quenching is more efficient in denser regions. We show that the overall mass quenching efficiency ($\epsilon_{mass}$) for more massive galaxies (log($M/M_{\odot}$)$\gtrsim$ 10.2) rises with cosmic time until $z\sim$ 1 and flattens out since then. However, for less massive galaxies, the rise in $\epsilon_{mass}$ continues to the present time. Our results suggest that environmental quenching is only relevant at $z\lesssim$ 1, likely a fast process, whereas mass quenching is the dominant mechanism at $z\gtrsim$ 1, with a possible stellar feedback physics.},

abstract = {Star-forming galaxies at $z > 1$ exhibit significantly different properties to local galaxies of equivalent stellar mass. Not only are high-redshift star-forming galaxies characterized by higher star formation rates and gas fractions than their local counterparts, they also appear to host star-forming regions with significantly different physical conditions, including greater electron densities. To understand what physical mechanisms are responsible for the observed evolution of star-forming conditions we have assembled the largest sample of star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 1.5$ with emission-line measurements of the $\mathrm{[OII]} \lambda \lambda 3726,3729$ doublet. By comparing our $z\sim 1.5$ sample to local galaxy samples with equivalent distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate and specific star formation rate we investigate the proposed evolution in electron density and its dependence on global properties. We measure an average electron density of $114_{-27}^{+28} \, \mathrm {cm}^{-3} $ for our $z\sim 1.5$ sample, a factor of five greater than the typical electron density of local star-forming galaxies. However, we find no offset between the typical electron densities of local and high-redshift galaxies with equivalent star-formation rates. Our work indicates that the average electron density of a sample is highly sensitive to the star formation rates, implying that the previously observed evolution is mainly the result of selection effects.},

Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from late galaxy types in underdense regions to early galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types—spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems—and describe some of their more detailed properties.

However, pinning down the co-evolution of galaxies and BH on an object-by-object basis remains elusive. I present results from new models for the joint evolution of galaxies, SMBH, and AGN, which may be able to help resolve some of the observational puzzles. A unique aspect of these models is our treatment of self-regulated BH growth based on hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy-galaxy mergers. Although these models do quite well at reproducing the observed evolution of galaxies, they do not reproduce the observed history of BH accretion, predicting too much early accretion and not enough at late times. I suggest two possible resolutions to this problem.},

abstract = {In a protocluster USS1558-003 at z = 2.53, galaxies in the dense cores show systematically elevated star-forming activity compared to those in less dense regions. To understand its origin, we look into the gas properties of the galaxies in the dense cores by conducting deep 1.1 mm observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We detect interstellar dust continuum emission from 12 member galaxies and estimate their molecular gas masses. Comparing these gas masses with our previous measurements from the CO(3–2) line, we infer that the latter might be overestimated. We find that the gas to stellar mass ratios of the galaxies in the dense cores tend to be higher (at M * ∼ 10 10 M ⊙ where we see the enhanced star-forming activity), suggesting that such large gas masses can sustain their high star-forming activity. However, if we compare the gas properties of these protocluster galaxies with the gas scaling relations constructed for field galaxies at a similar cosmic epoch, we find no significant environmental difference at the same stellar mass and star formation rate. Although both gas mass ratios and star-forming activity are enhanced in the majority of member galaxies, they appear to follow the same scaling relation as field galaxies. Our results are consistent with the scenario in which the cold gas is efficiently supplied to protocluster cores and to galaxies therein along surrounding filamentary structures, which leads to the high gas mass fractions and thus the elevated star formation activity, but without changing the star formation law.},

abstract = {We examine the star formation properties of group and field galaxies in two surveys, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (at z∼ 0.08) and Group Environment Evolution Collaboration (GEEC; at z∼ 0.4). Using ultraviolet imaging from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer space telescope, along with optical and, for GEEC, near-infrared photometry, we compare the observed spectral energy distributions to large suites of stellar population synthesis models. This allows us to accurately determine star formation rates and stellar masses. We find that star-forming galaxies of all environments undergo a systematic lowering of their star formation rate between z= 0.4 and 0.08 regardless of mass. None the less, the fraction of passive galaxies is higher in groups than the field at both redshifts. Moreover, the difference between the group and field grows with time and is mass dependent, in the sense the difference is larger at low masses. However, the star formation properties of star-forming galaxies, as measured by their average specific star formation rates, are consistent within the errors in the group and field environment at fixed redshift. The evolution of passive fraction in groups between z= 0.4 and 0 is consistent with a simple accretion model, in which galaxies are environmentally affected 3Gyr after falling into a ∼1013M⊙ group. This long time-scale appears to be inconsistent with the need to transform galaxies quickly enough to ensure that star-forming galaxies appear similar in both the group and field, as observed. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {Standard LCDM predicts that the major merger rate of galaxy-size dark matter halos rises rapidly with redshift. The average number of close companions per galaxy, Nc, is often used to infer the galaxy merger rate, however, recent observational studies suggest that Nc evolves very little with redshift. Here we use a "hybrid" N- body simulation plus analytic substructure model to predict Nc directly. We identify dark matter subhalos with galaxies and show that the observed lack of close pair count evolution arises because the high merger rate per halo at early times is counteracted by a decrease in the number of halos massive enough to host a galaxy pair. We compare our results to data compiled from the DEEP2, SSRS2, and the UZC redshift surveys. Observed pair counts match our predictions if we assume a monotonic mapping between galaxy luminosity and the maximum circular velocity that each subhalo had when it was first accreted onto its host halo. This suggests that satellite galaxies are significantly more resilient to destruction than are dissipationless dark matter subhalos. We argue that while Nc does not provide a direct measure of the halo merger rate, it offers a powerful means to constrain the Halo Occupation Distribution and the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos. Interpreted in this way, close pair counts provide a useful test of galaxy formation processes on < 100 kpc scales.},

Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations reveal three cold gas filaments converging into the center of the potential well of its ∼4 × 1013 Mpdbl dark matter halo, hosting 1200 Mpdbl yr-1 of star formation as probed by Atacama Large Millimeter Array and NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array observations. The nebula morphological and kinematics properties and the prevalence of blueshifted components in the Ly$\alpha$ spectra are consistent with a scenario of gas accretion. The upper limits on active galactic nuclei activity and overall energetics favor gravity as the primary Ly$\alpha$ powering source and infall as the main source of gas flows to the system. Although interpretational difficulties remain, with outflows and likely also photoionization with ensuing recombination still playing a role, this finding provides arguably an ideal environment to quantitatively test models of cold gas accretion and galaxy feeding inside an actively star-forming massive halo at high redshift.},

abstract = {We present here a simple model for the star formation history (SFH) of galaxies that is successful in describing both the star formation rate density (SFRD) over cosmic time, as well as the distribution of specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of galaxies at the current epoch, and the evolution of this quantity in galaxy populations to a redshift of z = 1. We show first that the cosmic SFRD is remarkably well described by a simple log-normal in time. We next postulate that this functional form for the ensemble is also a reasonable description for the SFHs of individual galaxies. Using the measured sSFRs for galaxies at z ∼ 0 from Paper III in this series, we then construct a realization of a universe populated by such galaxies in which the parameters of the log-normal SFH of each galaxy are adjusted to match the sSFRs at z 0 as well as fitting, in ensemble, the cosmic SFRD from z = 0 to z = 8. This model predicts, with striking fidelity, the distribution of sSFRs in mass-limited galaxy samples to z = 1; this match is not achieved by other models with a different functional form for the SFHs of individual galaxies, but with the same number of degrees of freedom, suggesting that the log-normal form is well matched to the likely actual histories of individual galaxies. We also impose the sSFR versus mass distributions at higher redshifts from Paper III as constraints on the model, and show that, as previously suggested, some galaxies in the field, particularly low mass galaxies, are quite young at intermediate redshifts. As emphasized in Paper III, starbursts are insufficient to explain the enhanced sSFRs in intermediate redshift galaxies; we show here that a model using only smoothly varying log-normal SFHs for galaxies, which allows for some fraction of the population to have peak star formation at late times, does however fully explain the observations. Finally, we show that this model, constrained in detail only at redshifts z {\textless} 1, also produces the main sequence of star-formation observed at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5, again suggesting that the log-normal SFHs are a close approximation to the actual histories of typical galaxies. {\textcopyright}2013.

The paper also collects observational evidence for gas accretion sustaining star formation. It reviews evidence inferred from neutral and ionized hydrogen, as well as from stars. A number of properties characterizing large samples of star-forming galaxies can be explained by metal-poor gas accretion, in particular, the relationship among stellar mass, metallicity, and star-formation rate (the so-called fundamental metallicity relationship). They are put forward and analyzed. Theory predicts gas accretion to be particularly important at high redshift, so indications based on distant objects are reviewed, including the global star-formation history of the universe, and the gas around galaxies as inferred from absorption features in the spectra of background sources. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014.},

Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

Very low amounts of molecular gas seem to be responsible for this, at least in some cases2–7, although morphological gas stabilization, shock heating or activity associated with accretion onto a central supermassive black hole are invoked in other cases8–11. Recent studies of quenching by gas depletion have been based on upper limits that are insufficiently sensitive to determine this robustly2–7, or stacked emission with its problems of averaging8,9. Here we report 1.3 mm observations of dust emission from 6 strongly lensed galaxies where star formation has been quenched, with magnifications of up to a factor of 30. Four of the six galaxies are undetected in dust emission, with an estimated upper limit on the dust mass of 0.0001 times the stellar mass, and by proxy (assuming a Milky Way molecular gas-to-dust ratio) 0.01 times the stellar mass in molecular gas. This is two orders of magnitude less molecular gas per unit stellar mass than seen in star forming galaxies at similar redshifts12–14. It remains difficult to extrapolate from these small samples, but these observations establish that gas depletion is responsible for a cessation of star formation in some fraction of high-redshift galaxies.},

@article{Bekki2011a,
abstract = {Recent observations have revealed that the time-evolution of the S0 number fraction at intermediate and high redshifts (0.2 < z < 0.8) is more dramatic in groups of galaxies than in clusters. In order to understand the origin of S0s in groups, we investigate numerically the morphological transformation of spirals into S0s through group-related physical processes. Our chemodynamical simulations show that spirals in group environments can be strongly influenced by repetitive slow encounters with group member galaxies so that those with thin discs and prominent spiral arm structures can be transformed into S0s with thick discs and without any prominent spiral arm structure. Such tidal interactions can also trigger repetitive starbursts within the bulges of spirals and consequently increase significantly the masses of their bulges. Owing to the rapid consumption of gas initially in spirals during the bulge growth, the S0s can become gas-poor. The S0s transformed from spirals in this way have young and metal-rich stellar populations in the inner regions of their bulges. The simulated S0s have lower maximum rotational velocities and flatter radial line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles in comparison to their progenitor spirals. The formation processes of S0s due to tidal interactions depend not only on the masses and orbits of the progenitor spirals, but also on the group mass. A significant fraction (10-30 per cent) of stars and gas can be stripped during this spiral to S0 morphological transformation so that intragroup stars and gas can be formed. Based on these results, we discuss structures, kinematics, chemical properties and the Tully-Fisher relation of S0s in groups. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

@article{Cappellari2011,
abstract = {In Paper I of this series we introduced a volume-limited parent sample of 871 galaxies from which we extracted the ATLAS 3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs). In Papers II and III we classified the ETGs using their stellar kinematics, in a way that is nearly insensitive to the projection effects, and we separated them into fast and slow rotators. Here we look at galaxy morphology and note that the edge-on fast rotators generally are lenticular galaxies. They appear like spiral galaxies with the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals (E5 or flatter) with discy isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of bulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder (E4 or rounder, except for counter-rotating discs) and are generally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical galaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it gives a misleading description of ETGs by ignoring the large variation in the bulge sizes of fast rotators. Motivated by the fact that only one third (34 per cent) of the ellipticals in our sample are slow rotators, we study for the first time the kinematic morphology-density T-$\Sigma$ relation using fast and slow rotators to replace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than using classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density environments [per cent] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR) ≈ 4 per cent] of the total galaxy population in the relatively low-density environments explored by our survey, with the exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR) ≈ 20 per cent]. This contrasts with the classic studies that invariably find significant fractions of (misclassified) ellipticals down to the lowest environmental densities. We find a clean log-linear relation between the fraction f(Sp) of spiral galaxies and the local galaxy surface density $\Sigma$ 3, within a cylinder enclosing the three nearest galaxies. This holds for nearly four orders of magnitude in the surface density down to $\Sigma$ 3≈ 0.01Mpc -2, with f(Sp) decreasing by 10 per cent per dex in $\Sigma$ 3, while f(FR) correspondingly increases. The existence of a smooth kinematic T-$\Sigma$ relation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment, like e.g. ram-pressure stripping, as main contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast rotators in low-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local effects at the small-group scale. This is supported by the relation becoming shallower when using a surface density estimator $\Sigma$ 10 with a cluster scale. Only at the largest densities in the Virgo core does the f(Sp) relation break down and steepen sharply, while the fraction of slow rotators starts to significantly increase. This suggests that a different mechanism is at work there, possibly related to the stripping of the gas from spirals by the hot intergalactic medium in the cluster core and the corresponding lack of cold accretion. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) it has recently been shown that the red fraction of satellite galaxies increases with stellar mass. Semi-analytical models, however, predict red satellite fractions that are independent of stellar mass, and much higher than observed. It has been argued that this discrepancy owes to the fact that the models assume that satellite galaxies are instantaneously stripped of their hot gas reservoirs at the moment they are accreted into a bigger halo. In this letter we show that the fraction of red satellites can be brought in better agreement with the data by simply decreasing this stripping efficiency. However, this also results in a red fraction of massive centrals that is much too low. This owes to the fact that the massive centrals now accrete satellite galaxies that are bluer and more gas-rich. However, if a significant fraction of low mass satellite galaxies is tidally disrupted before being accreted by their central host galaxy, as suggested by recent studies, the red fractions of both centrals and satellites can be reproduced reasonably well. A problem remains with the red fraction of centrals of intermediate mass, which is likely to reflect an oversimplified treatment of AGN feedback.},

Using imaging from the Chandra X-ray Telescope, we find a large overdensity of AGN in the protocluster; a factor of 23 ± 9 times the field density of AGN. Only half of this AGN overdensity is due to the overdensity of massive galaxies in the protocluster (a factor of 11 ± 2), as we find that 17+6-5 per cent of massive galaxies (M* > 1010 M⊙) in the protocluster host an X-ray luminous AGN, compared to 8 ± 1 per cent in the field. This corresponds to an enhancement of AGN activity in massive protocluster galaxies by a factor of 2.1 ± 0.7 at 1.6$\sigma$ significance. We also find that the AGN overdensity is centrally concentrated, located within 3 arcmin and most pronounced within 1 arcmin of the centre of the protocluster. Our results confirm that there is a reversal in the local anticorrelation between galaxy density and AGN activity, so there is an enhancement of AGN in high-redshift protoclusters. We compare the properties of AGN in the protocluster to the field and find no significant differences in the distributions of their stellar mass, X-ray luminosity or hardness ratio. We therefore suggest that triggering mechanisms are similar in both environments, and that the mechanisms simply occur more frequently in denser environments.},

abstract = {Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs created from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we examine in detail the specific star formation rate (SSFR) distribution of satellite galaxies and its dependence on stellar mass, host halo mass, and halo-centric radius. All galaxies, regardless of central-satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR $\sim$ 10^-11 yr^-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the `green valley'. Satellite galaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched (`red sequence') side of the SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo masses down to 3 x 10^11 Msol and increases strongly with halo mass and toward halo center. We find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond $\sim$2R_vir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they cross within $\sim$R_vir of a more massive host halo, (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyrs, and (3) once begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results place strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as we will discuss further in companion papers.},

abstract = {In mergers of disk galaxies, gas plays a role quite out of proportion to its relatively modest contribution to the total mass. To study this behavior, we have included gasdynamics in self-consistent simulations of collisions between equal-mass disk galaxies. The large-scale dynamics of bridge- and tail-making, orbit decay, and merging are not much altered by the inclusion of a gaseous component. However, tidal forces during encounters cause otherwise stable disks to develop bars, and the gas in such barred disks, subjected to strong gravitational torques, flows toward the central regions where it may fuel the kiloparsec-scale starbursts seen in some interacting disk systems. Similar torques on the gas during the final stages of a collision yield massive gas concentrations in the cores of merger remnants, which may be plausibly identified with the molecular complexes seen in objects such as NGC 520 and Arp 220. This result appears insensitive to the detailed microphysics of the gas, provided that radiative cooling is permitted. The inflowing gas can dramatically alter the stellar morphology of a merger remnant, apparently by deepening the potential well and thereby changing the boundaries between the major orbital families.},

We split the samples according to density and luminosity, and recover the expected bimodal distribution in the colour-morphology plane, shown especially clearly by this subsampling. We quantify the bimodality by a sum of two Gaussians on the colour and morphology axes, and show that, for the red-/early-type population both colour and morphology do not change significantly as a function of density. For the blue-/late-type population, with increasing density the colour becomes redder but the morphology again does not change significantly. Both populations become monotonically redder and of earlier type with increasing luminosity. There is no significant qualitative difference between the behaviour of the two morphological measures. Motivated by their long-standing use in astronomy and their ability to utilize information not necessarily used by the concentration and S{\'{e}}rsic indices, we supplement the morphological sample with 13 655 galaxies assigned Hubble types by an artificial neural network. We find, however, that the resulting distribution is less well described by two Gaussians. Therefore, there are either more than two significant morphological populations, physical processes not seen in colour space, or the Hubble type, particularly the different subtypes of spirals Sa-Sd, has an irreducible fuzziness when related to environmental density. For each of the three measures of morphology, on removing the density relation due to it, we recover a strong residual relation in colour. However, on similarly removing the colour-density relation there is no evidence for a residual relation due to morphology. Therefore, either the morphology is not directly affected by the environmental density beyond the correlation to colour, or a single galaxy 'type' does not capture sufficient information. {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

abstract = {We present the first results from our CGM at Cosmic Noon with KCWI program to study gas flows in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) at $z=2-3$. Combining the power of a high-resolution VLT/UVES quasar spectrum, an HST/ACS image, and integral field spectroscopy with Keck/KCWI, we detected Lya emission from a $1.7L_{\ast}$ galaxy at $z_{\rm gal}=2.0711$ associated with a Lyman limit system with weak MgII ($W_r(2796)=0.24$ Ang) in quasar field J143040$+$014939. The galaxy is star-forming (${\rm SFR}_{\rm FUV}=37.8$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and clumpy: either an edge-on disk ($i=85^{\circ}$) or, less likely, a major merger. The background quasar probes the galaxy at an impact parameter of $D=66$ kpc along the projected galaxy minor axis ($\Phi=89^{\circ}$). From photoionization modeling of the absorption system, we infer a total line-of-sight CGM metallicity of ${\rm [Si/H]}=-1.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$. The absorption system is roughly kinematically symmetric about $z_{\rm gal}$, with a full MgII velocity spread of $\sim210$ km s$^{-1}$. Given the galaxy-quasar orientation, CGM metallicity, and gas kinematics, we interpret this gas as an outflow that has likely swept-up additional material. By modeling the absorption as a polar outflow cone, we find the gas is decelerating with average radial velocity $V_{\rm out}=109-588$ km s$^{-1}$ for half opening angles of $\theta_0=14^{\circ}-75^{\circ}$. Assuming a constant $V_{\rm out}$, it would take on average $t_{\rm out}\sim111-597$ Myr for the gas to reach 66 kpc. The outflow is energetic, with a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm out}<52{\pm37}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and mass loading factor of $\eta<1.4{\pm1.0}$. We aim to build a sample of $\sim50$ MgII absorber--galaxy pairs at this epoch to better understand gas flows when they are most actively building galaxies.},

abstract = {We investigate the relationship between the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) and star formation rate (SFR) for Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-mass progenitors from z = 0.2 to 2.5. We source galaxies from the Ks-band-selected ZFOURGE survey, which includes multiwavelength data spanning 0.3-160 $\mu$m. We use decomposition software to split the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of our galaxies into their active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star-forming components, which allows us to estimate BHARs and SFRs from the infrared (IR). We perform tests to check the robustness of these estimates, including a comparison with BHARs and SFRs derived from X-ray stacking and far-IR analysis, respectively. We find that, as the progenitors evolve their relative black hole-galaxy growth (i.e. their BHAR/SFR ratio) increases from low to high redshift. The MW-mass progenitors exhibit a log-log slope of 0.64 ± 0.11, while the M31-mass progenitors are 0.39 ± 0.08. This result contrasts with previous studies that find an almost flat slope when adopting X-ray-/AGNselected or mass-limited samples and is likely due to their use of a broad mixture of galaxies with different evolutionary histories. Our use of progenitor-matched samples highlights the potential importance of carefully selecting progenitors when searching for evolutionary relationships between BHAR/SFRs. Additionally, our finding that BHAR/SFR ratios do not track the rate at which progenitors quench casts doubts over the idea that the suppression of star formation is predominantly driven by luminous AGN feedback (i.e. high BHARs).},

abstract = {The last seven years have seen an explosion in the number of Integral Field galaxy surveys, obtaining resolved 2D spectroscopy, especially at high-redshift. These have taken advantage of the mature capabilities of 8-10 m class telescopes and the development of associated technology such as AO. Surveys have leveraged both high spectroscopic resolution enabling internal velocity measurements and high spatial resolution from AO techniques and sites with excellent natural seeing. For the first time, we have been able to glimpse the kinematic state of matter in young, assembling star-forming galaxies and learn detailed astrophysical information about the physical processes and compare their kinematic scaling relations with those in the local Universe. Observers have measured disc galaxy rotation, merger signatures, and turbulence-enhanced velocity dispersions of gas-rich discs. Theorists have interpreted kinematic signatures of galaxies in a variety of ways (rotation, merging, outflows, and feedback) and attempted to discuss evolution vs. theoretical models and relate it to the evolution in galaxy morphology. A key point that has emerged from this activity is that substantial fractions of high-redshift galaxies have regular kinematic morphologies despite irregular photometric morphologies and this is likely due to the presence of a large number of highly gas-rich discs. There has not yet been a review of this burgeoning topic. In this first Dawes review, I will discuss the extensive kinematic surveys that have been done and the physical models that have arisen for young galaxies at high-redshift. {\textcopyright} 2013 Astronomical Society of Australia.},

abstract = {We present initial results of a deep near-IR spectroscopic survey covering the 15 fields of the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey using the recently commissioned MOSFIRE spectrometer on the Keck 1 telescope. We focus on a sample of 251 galaxies with redshifts 2.0 < z < 2.6, star formation rates (SFRs) 2 ≲ SFR ≲ 200 M⊙ yr-1, and stellar masses 8.6 < log (M∗/M⊙) < 11.4, with high-quality spectra in both H- and K-band atmospheric windows. We show unambiguously that the locus of z ∼ 2.3 galaxies in the "BPT" nebular diagnostic diagram exhibits an almost entirely disjointed, yet similarly tight, relationship between the line ratios [N II] $\lambda$6585/H$\alpha$ and [O III]/H$\beta$ as compared to local galaxies. Using photoionization models, we argue that the offset of the z ∼ 2.3 BPT locus relative to that at z ∼ 0 is caused by a combination of harder stellar ionizing radiation field, higher ionization parameter, and higher N/O at a given O/H compared to most local galaxies, and that the position of a galaxy along the z ∼ 2.3 star-forming BPT locus is surprisingly insensitive to gas-phase oxygen abundance. The observed nebular emission line ratios are most easily reproduced by models in which the net stellar ionizing radiation field resembles a blackbody with effective temperature T eff = 50, 000-60, 000 K, the gas-phase oxygen abundances lie in the range 0.2 < Z/Z⊙ < 1.0, and the ratio of gas-phase N/O is close to the solar value. We critically assess the applicability at high redshift of commonly used strong line indices for estimating gas-phase metallicity, and consider the implications of the small intrinsic scatter of the empirical relationship between excitation-sensitive line indices and M ∗ (i.e., the "mass-metallicity" relation) at z ≃ 2.3.},

@article{DeLucia2012a,
abstract = {We use publicly available galaxy merger trees, obtained applying semi-analytic techniques to a large high-resolution cosmological simulation, to study the environmental history of group and cluster galaxies. Our results highlight the existence of an intrinsic history bias which makes the nature versus nurture (as well as the mass versus environment) debate inherently ill posed. In particular, we show that (i) surviving massive satellites were accreted later than their less massive counterparts, from more massive haloes and (ii) the mixing of galaxy populations is incomplete during halo assembly, which creates a correlation between the time a galaxy becomes satellite and its present distance from the parent halo centre. The weakest trends are found for the most massive satellites, as a result of efficient dynamical friction and late formation times of massive haloes. A large fraction of the most massive group/cluster members are accreted on to the main progenitor of the final halo as central galaxies, while about half of the galaxies with low and intermediate stellar masses are accreted as satellites. Large fractions of group and cluster galaxies (in particular those of low stellar mass) have therefore been 'pre-processed' as satellites of groups with mass ∼10 13M ⊙. To quantify the relevance of hierarchical structure growth on the observed environmental trends, we have considered observational estimates of the passive galaxy fractions and their variation as a function of halo mass and clustercentric distance. Comparisons with our theoretical predictions require relatively long times (∼5-7 Gyr) for the suppression of star formation in group and cluster satellites. It is unclear how such a gentle mode of strangulation can be achieved by simply relaxing the assumption of instantaneous stripping of the hot gas reservoir associated with accreting galaxies, or if the difficulties encountered by recent galaxy formation models in reproducing the observed trends signal a more fundamental problem with the treatment of star formation and feedback in these galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of local environment on the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) spanning a wide range of galaxy densities from the field up to dense cores of massive galaxy clusters. Data are drawn from a sample of eight fields from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. Deep photometry allow us to select mass-complete samples of galaxies down to 10^9 Msol. Taking advantage of >4000 secure spectroscopic redshifts from ORELSE and precise photometric redshifts, we construct 3-dimensional density maps between 0.55<z<1.3 using a Voronoi tessellation approach. We find that the shape of the SMF depends strongly on local environment exhibited by a smooth, continual increase in the relative numbers of high- to low-mass galaxies towards denser environments. A straightforward implication is that local environment proportionally increases the efficiency of (a) destroying lower-mass galaxies and/or (b) growth of higher-mass galaxies. We also find a presence of this environmental dependence in the SMFs of star-forming and quiescent galaxies, although not quite as strongly for the quiescent subsample. To characterize the connection between the SMF of field galaxies and that of denser environments we devise a simple semi-empirical model. The model begins with a sample of $\sim$10^6 galaxies at z_start=5 with stellar masses distributed according to the field. Simulated galaxies then evolve down to z_final=0.8 following empirical prescriptions for star-formation, quenching, and galaxy-galaxy merging. We run the simulation multiple times, testing a variety of scenarios with differing overall amounts of merging. Our model suggests that a large number of mergers are required to reproduce the SMF in dense environments. Additionally, a large majority of these mergers would have to occur in intermediate density environments (e.g. galaxy groups).},

abstract = {(Abridged) We use 101 galaxies selected from the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey (NFGS) to investigate the effect of aperture size on the star formation rate, metallicity and reddening determinations for galaxies. We compare the star formation rate, metallicity and reddening derived from nuclear spectra to those derived from integrated spectra. For apertures capturing <20% of the B(26) light, the differences between nuclear and global metallicity, extinction and star formation rate are substantial. We calculate an `expected' star formation rate using our nuclear spectra and apply the commonly-used aperture correction method. The expected star formation rate overestimates the global value for early type spirals, with large scatter for all Hubble types, particularly late types. The differences between the expected and global star formation rates probably result from the assumption that the distributions of the emission-line gas and the continuum are identical. We discuss the implications of these results for metallicity-luminosity relations and star formation history studies based on fiber spectra. To reduce systematic and random errors from aperture effects, we recommend selecting samples with fibers that capture >20% of the galaxy light. For the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2dFGRS, redshifts z>0.04 and z>0.06 are required, respectively, to ensure a covering fraction >20% for galaxies similar to the average size, type, and luminosity observed in our sample. Higher luminosity samples and samples containing many late-type galaxies require a larger minimum redshift to ensure that >20% of the galaxy light is enclosed by the fiber.},

The estimated stellar masses range from ∼108.5-109.5 MȮ, and a clear positive correlation between metallicity and stellar mass is observed. The average ionization parameter measured for the sample, log U ≈ -2.5, is significantly higher than what is found for most star-forming galaxies in the local universe, but similar to the values found for other star-forming galaxies at high redshift. We derive composite spectra from the FIRE sample, from which we measure typical nebular electron densities of ∼100-400 cm-3. Based on the location of the galaxies and composite spectra on diagnostic diagrams, we do not find evidence for significant active galactic nucleus activity in the sample. Most of the galaxies, as well as the composites, are offset diagram toward higher [O III]/H$\beta$ at a given [N II]/H$\alpha$, in agreement with other observations of z ≳ 1 star-forming galaxies, but composite spectra derived from the sample do not show an appreciable offset from the local star-forming sequence on the [O III]/H$\beta$ versus [S II]/H$\alpha$ diagram. We infer a high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio from the composite spectrum, which may contribute to the offset of the high-redshift galaxies from the local star-forming sequence in the [O III]/H$\beta$ versus [N II]/H$\alpha$ diagram. We speculate that the elevated nitrogen abundance could result from substantial numbers of Wolf-Rayet stars in starbursting galaxies at z ∼ 2. {\textcopyright} 2014.

abstract = {Aims. Cluster environments at z < 0.5 were found to increase the gas metallicities of galaxies which enter inner regions of the clusters where the density of the intracluster medium is high enough to remove their hot halo gas by ram-pressure stripping effects and to stop the inflow of pristine gas. To extend these studies to z > 1, the most massive clusters known at these redshifts are the sites where these environmental effects should be more pronounced and more easily observed with present day telescopes. Methods. We explore the massive cluster XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at z ∼ 1.5 with KMOS spectroscopy of H$\alpha$ and [N II] $\lambda$ 6584 covering a region that corresponds to about one virial radius. Using published spectroscopic redshifts of 108 galaxies in and around the cluster we computed the location of galaxies in the projected velocity-versus-position phase-space to separate our cluster sample into a virialized region of objects accreted longer ago (roughly inside half R200) and a region of infalling galaxies. We measured oxygen abundances for ten cluster galaxies with detected [N II] $\lambda$ 6584 lines in the individual galaxy spectra and compared the mass-metallicity relation of the galaxies inside half R200 with the infalling galaxies and a field sample at similar redshifts. Results. We find that the oxygen abundances of individual z ∼ 1.5 star-forming cluster galaxies inside half R200 are comparable, at the respective stellar mass, to the higher local SDSS metallicity values. We compare our measurements with a field galaxy sample from the KMOS3D survey at similar redshifts. We find that the [N II] $\lambda$ 6584/H$\alpha$ line ratios inside half R200 are higher by 0.2 dex and that the resultant metallicities of the galaxies in the inner part of the cluster are higher by about 0.1 dex, at a given mass, than the metallicities of infalling galaxies and of field galaxies at z ∼ 1.5. The enhanced metallicities of cluster galaxies at z ∼ 1.5 inside 0.5R200 indicate that the density of the intracluster medium in this massive cluster becomes high enough toward the cluster center such that the ram pressure exceeds the restoring pressure of the hot gas reservoir of cluster galaxies. This can remove the gas reservoir and initiate quenching; although the galaxies continue to form stars, albeit at slightly lower rates, using the available cold gas in the disk which is not stripped.},

abstract = { We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of giant Ly $\alpha$ halos surrounding nine galaxy groups and clusters at 2 < z < 3.3, including five new detections and one upper limit. We find observational evidence for the cold-stream to hot-accretion transition predicted by theory by measuring a decrease in the ratio between the spatially extended Ly $\alpha$ luminosity and the expected baryonic accretion rate (BAR), with increasing elongation above the transition mass ( M stream ). This implies a modulation of the share of BAR that remains cold, diminishing quasi-linearly (logarithmic slope of 0.97 ± 0.19, 5 $\sigma$ significance) with the halo to M stream mass ratio. The integrated star formation rates (SFRs) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) bolometric luminosities display a potentially consistent decrease, albeit significant only at 2.6 $\sigma$ and 1.3 $\sigma$ , respectively. The higher scatter in these tracers suggests the Ly $\alpha$ emission might be mostly a direct product of cold accretion in these structures rather than indirect, mediated by outflows and photoionization from SFR and AGNs; this is also supported by energetics considerations. Below M stream (cold-stream regime), we measure L  Ly $\alpha$  /BAR = 10 40.51±0.16 erg s −1        M   ⊙   − 1      yr, consistent with predictions, and SFR/BAR = 10 −0.54±0.23 : on average,        30   − 10   + 20      % of the cold streams go into stars. Above M stream (hot-accretion regime), L  Ly $\alpha$  is set by M stream (within 0.2 dex scatter in our sample), independent of the halo mass but rising 10-fold from z = 2 to 3. },

abstract = {Galaxy mergers are a major evolutionary transformation whose effects are borne out by a plethora of observations and numerical simulations. However, most previous simulations have used idealized, isolated, binary mergers and there has not been significant progress on studying statistical samples of galaxy mergers in large cosmological simulations. We present a sample of 27 691 post-merger (PM) galaxies (0c ≤ z ≤ 1) identified from IllustrisTNG: a cosmological, large box, magnetohydrodynamical simulation suite. The PM sample spans a wide range of merger and galaxy properties (M∗, $\mu$, fgas). We demonstrate that star-forming (SF) PMs exhibit enhanced star formation rates (SFRs) on average by a factor of $\sim$2, while the passive PMs showno statistical enhancement.We find that the SFR enhancements: (1) show no dependence on redshift, (2) anticorrelate with the PM's stellar mass, and (3) correlate with the gas fraction of the PM's progenitors. However, SF PMs show stronger enhancements which may indicate other processes being at play (e.g. gas phase, feedback efficiency). Although the SFR enhancement correlates mildly with the merger mass ratio, the more abundant minor mergers (0.1 ≤ $\mu$ < 0.3) still contribute $\sim$50 per cent of the total SFR enhancement. By tracing the PM sample forward in time, we find that galaxy mergers can drive significant SFR enhancements which decay over $\sim$0.5 Gyr independent of the merger mass ratio, although the decay time-scale is dependent on the simulation resolution. The strongest merger-driven starburst galaxies evolve to be passive/quenched on faster time-scales than their controls.},

abstract = {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESA star, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESA star solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M⊙ star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

abstract = {We introduce the IllustrisTNG project, a new suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO employing an updated Illustris galaxy formation model. Here we focus on the general properties of magnetic fields and the diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters. Magnetic fields are prevalent in galaxies, and their build-up is closely linked to structure formation. We find that structure formation amplifies the initial seed fields (10 −14 comoving Gauss) to the values observed in low-redshift galaxies (1-10 $\mu$G). The magnetic field topology is closely connected to galaxy morphology such that irregular fields are hosted by early-type galaxies, while large-scale, ordered fields are present in disc galaxies. Using two simple models for the energy distribution of relativistic electrons we predict the diffuse radio emission of 280 clusters with a baryonic mass resolution of 1.1 × 10 7 M, and generate mock observations for Very Large Array (VLA), Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our simulated clusters show extended radio emission, whose detectability correlates with their virial mass. We reproduce the observed scaling relations between total radio power and X-ray emission, M 500 , and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Y 500 parameter. The radio emission surface brightness profiles of our most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement with VLA measurements of Coma and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended radio haloes as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different instruments. Overall our results agree encouragingly well with observations, but a refined analysis requires a more sophisticated treatment of relativistic particles in large-scale galaxy formation simulations.},

abstract = {We evaluate the effects of environment and stellar mass on galaxy properties at 0.85 <z < 1.20 using a 3.6 $\mu$m-selected spectroscopic sample of 797 cluster and field galaxies drawn from the Gemini Cluster Astrophysics Spectroscopic Survey. We confirm that for galaxies with the well-known correlations between environment and properties such as star-forming fraction (f SF), star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (SSFR), D n(4000), and color are already in place at z ∼ 1. We separate the effects of environment and stellar mass on galaxies by comparing the properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at fixed environment and fixed stellar mass. The SSFR of star-forming galaxies at fixed environment is correlated with stellar mass; however, at fixed stellar mass it is independent of environment. The same trend exists for the D n(4000) measures of both the star-forming and quiescent galaxies and shows that their properties are determined primarily by their stellar mass, not by their environment. Instead, it appears that environment's primary role is to control the fraction of star-forming galaxies. Using the spectra we identify candidate poststarburst galaxies and find that those with 9.3 times more common in high-density regions compared to low-density regions. The clear association of poststarbursts with high-density regions as well as the lack of a correlation between the SSFRs and D n(4000)s of star-forming galaxies with their environment strongly suggests that at z 1 the environmental-quenching timescale must be rapid. Lastly, we construct a simple quenching model which demonstrates that the lack of a correlation between the D n(4000) of quiescent galaxies and their environment results naturally if self quenching dominates over environmental quenching at z > 1, or if the evolution of the self-quenching rate mirrors the evolution of the environmental-quenching rate at z > 1, regardless of which dominates.

Large spirals are severely stripped in rich clusters and may be mildly stripped in groups. Dwarf galaxies can be severely stripped in both clusters and groups. A model is developed that describes the stripping of a satellite galaxy's outer H \textsc{i} disk and hot galactic halo. The model can be applied to a wide range of environments and satellite galaxy masses. Whether ram pressure stripping of the outer disk or hot galactic halo occurs is found to depend primarily on the ratio of the satellite galaxy mass to the mass of the host group or cluster. How the effectiveness of ram pressure stripping depends on the density of the inter-group gas, the dark matter halo concentrations, and the scale lengths and masses of the satellite components is explored. The predictions of the model are shown to be well matched to H \textsc{i} observations of spirals in a sample of nearby clusters. The model is used to predict the range of H \textsc{i} gas fractions a satellite of mass $M_{v,sat}$ can lose orbiting in a cluster of mass $M_{v,gr}$.},

abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z > 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AON) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z ∼ 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z ∼ 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for 'antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {The density of the warm ionized gas in high-redshift galaxies is known to be higher than what is typical in local galaxies on similar scales. At the same time, the mean global properties of the high- and low-redshift galaxies are quite different. Here, we present a detailed differential analysis of the ionization parameters of 14 star-forming galaxies at redshift 2.6-3.4, compiled from the literature. For each of those high-redshift galaxies, we construct a comparison sample of low-redshift galaxies closely matched in specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass, thus ensuring that their global physical conditions are similar to the high-redshift galaxy. We find that the median log [OIII] 5007/ [OII] 3727 line ratio of the high-redshift galaxies is 0.5 dex higher than their local counterparts. We construct a new calibration between the [OIII] 5007/ [OII] 3727 emission line ratio and ionization parameter to estimate the difference between the ionization parameters in the high and low-redshift samples. Using this, we show that the typical density of the warm ionized gas in star-forming regions decreases by a median factor of $7.1^{+10.2}_{-5.4}$ from z $\sim$ 3.3 to z $\sim$ 0 at fixed mass and sSFR. We show that metallicity differences cannot explain the observed density differences. Because the high- and low-redshift samples are comparable in size, we infer that the relationship between star formation rate density and gas density must have been significantly less efficient at z $\sim$2-3 than what is observed in nearby galaxies with similar levels of star formation activity.},

The gas-phase oxygen abundance, ionization parameter, and electron density of ionized gas are derived from rest-frame optical strong emission lines measured on near-infrared spectra obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE. We remove the effect of these strong emission lines in the broad-band fluxes to compute stellar masses via spectral energy distribution fitting, while the SFR is derived from the dust-corrected ultraviolet luminosity. The ionization parameter is weakly correlated with the specific SFR, but otherwise the ionization parameter and electron density do not correlate with other global galaxy properties such as stellar mass, SFR, and metallicity. The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at {\$}z\backslashsimeq3.3{\$} shows lower metallicity by {\$}\backslashsimeq 0.7{\$} dex than that at {\$}z=0{\$} at the same stellar mass. Our sample shows an offset by {\$}\backslashsimeq 0.3{\$} dex from the locally defined mass-metallicity-SFR relation, indicating that simply extrapolating such relation to higher redshift may predict an incorrect evolution of MZR. Furthermore, within the uncertainties we find no SFR-metallicity correlation, suggesting a less important role of SFR in controlling the metallicity at high redshift.

abstract = {The abundance ratios between key elements such as iron and $\alpha$‐process elements carry a wealth of information on the star formation history (SFH) of galaxies. So far, simple chemical evolution models have linked [$\alpha$/Fe ] with the SFH time‐scale, correlating large abundance ratios with short‐lived SFH. The incorporation of full spectral fitting to the analysis of stellar populations allows for a more quantitative constraint between [$\alpha$/Fe ] and the SFH. In this letter, we provide, for the first time, an empirical correlation between [$\alpha$/Fe ] (measured from spectral indices) and the SFH (determined via a non‐parametric spectral‐fitting method). We offer an empirical version of the iconic outline of Thomas et al., relating star formation time‐scale with galaxy mass, although our results suggest, in contrast, a significant population of old (≳10 Gyr) stars even for the lowest mass ellipticals (M/dyn ∼ 3 × 1010 M⊙). In addition, the abundance ratio is found to be strongly correlated with the time to build up the stellar component, showing that the highest [$\alpha$/Fe ] (≳+0.2) are attained by galaxies with the shortest half‐mass formation time (≲2 Gyr), or equivalently, with the smallest (≲40 per cent) fraction of populations younger than 10 Gyr. These observational results support the standard hypothesis that star formation incorporates the Fe‐enriched interstellar medium into stars, lowering the high abundance ratio of the old populations. },

abstract = {Galaxy-galaxy interactions are predicted to cause gas inflows leading to enhanced nuclear star formation. This prediction is borne out observationally, and is also supported by the gas-phase metallicity dilution in the inner regions of galaxies in close pairs. In this paper we test the further prediction that the gas inflows lead to enhanced accretion on to the central supermassive black hole, triggering activity in the nucleus. Based on a sample of 11060 Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies with a close companion (rp < 80h-170 kpc, $\Delta$V < 200kms-1), we classify active galactic nuclei (AGN) based either on emission line ratios or on spectral classification as a quasar. The AGN fraction in the close pairs sample is compared to a control sample of 110600 mass- and redshift-matched control galaxies with no nearby companion. We find a clear increase in the AGN fraction in close pairs of galaxies with projected separations < 40 h-170 kpc by up to a factor of 2.5 relative to the control sample [although the enhancement depends on the chosen signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) cut of the sample]. The increase in AGN fraction is strongest in equal-mass galaxy pairings, and weakest in the lower mass component of an unequal-mass pairing. The increased AGN fraction at small separations is accompanied by an enhancement in the number of 'composite' galaxies whose spectra are the result of photoionization by both AGN and stars. Our results indicate that AGN activity occurs (at least in some cases) well before final coalescence and concurrently with ongoing star formation. Finally, we find a marked increase at small projected separations of the fraction of pairs in which both galaxies harbour AGN. We demonstrate that the fraction of double AGN exceeds the expected random fraction, indicating that some pairs undergo correlated nuclear activity. We discuss some of the factors that have led to conflicting results in previous studies of AGN in close pairs. Taken together with complementary studies, we favour an interpretation where interactions trigger AGN, but are not the only cause of nuclear activity. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {We use a mass complete (log($M/M_{\odot}$) $\geqslant$ 9.6) sample of galaxies with accurate photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field to construct the density field and the cosmic web to $z$=1.2. The comic web extraction relies on the density field Hessian matrix and breaks the density field into clusters, filaments and the field. We provide the density field and cosmic web measures to the community. We show that at $z$ $\lesssim$ 0.8, the median star-formation rate (SFR) in the cosmic web gradually declines from the field to clusters and this decline is especially sharp for satellites ($\sim$ 1 dex vs. $\sim$ 0.5 dex for centrals). However, at $z$ $\gtrsim$ 0.8, the trend flattens out for the overall galaxy population and satellites. For star-forming galaxies only, the median SFR is constant at $z$ $\gtrsim$ 0.5 but declines by $\sim$ 0.3-0.4 dex from the field to clusters for satellites and centrals at $z$ $\lesssim$ 0.5. We argue that for satellites, the main role of the cosmic web environment is to control their star-forming fraction, whereas for centrals, it is mainly to control their overall SFR at $z$ $\lesssim$ 0.5 and to set their fraction at $z$ $\gtrsim$ 0.5. We suggest that most satellites experience a rapid quenching mechanism as they fall from the field into clusters through filaments, whereas centrals mostly undergo a slow environmental quenching at $z$ $\lesssim$ 0.5 and a fast mechanism at higher redshifts. Our preliminary results highlight the importance of the large-scale cosmic web on galaxy evolution.},

abstract = {We revisit the question of 'hot mode' versus 'cold mode' accretion onto galaxies using steady-state cooling flow solutions and idealized 3D hydrodynamic simulations. We demonstrate that for the hot accretion mode to exist, the cooling time is required to be longer than the free-fall time near the radius where the gas is rotationally-supported, R_circ, i.e. the existence of the hot mode depends on physical conditions at the galaxy scale rather than on physical conditions at the halo scale. When allowing for the depletion of the halo baryon fraction relative to the cosmic mean, the longer cooling times imply that a virialized gaseous halo may form in halo masses below the threshold of $\sim$10^12 M_sun derived for baryon-complete halos. We show that for any halo mass there is a maximum accretion rate for which the gas is virialized throughout the halo and can accrete via the hot mode of Mdot_crit $\sim$ 0.7(v_c/100 km/s)^5.4 (R_circ / 10 kpc) (Z/Z_sun)^-0.9 M_sun / yr, where Z and v_c are the metallicity and circular velocity measured at R_circ. For accretion rates >$\sim$Mdot_crit the volume-filling gas phase can in principle be `transonic' -- virialized in the outer halo but cool and free-falling near the galaxy. We compare Mdot_crit to the average star formation rate (SFR) in halos at 0<z<10 implied by the stellar-mass halo-mass relation. For a plausible metallicity evolution with redshift, we find that SFR <$\sim$ Mdot_crit at most masses and redshifts, suggesting that the SFR of galaxies could be primarily sustained by the hot mode in halo masses well below the classic threshold of $\sim$10^12 M_sun.},

abstract = {We present spectra of the most massive quiescent galaxy yet discovered at $z>3$, spectroscopically confirmed via the detection of Balmer absorption features in the $H-$ and $K-$bands of Keck/MOSFIRE. The spectra confirm a galaxy with no significant ongoing star formation, consistent with the lack of rest-frame UV flux and overall photometric spectral energy distribution. With a stellar mass of $3.1^{+0.1}_{-0.2} \times 10^{11} \sim\rm{M}_\odot$ at $z = 3.493$, this galaxy is nearly three times more massive than the highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed absorption-line identified galaxy known. The star-formation history of this quiescent galaxy implies that it formed $>1000 \sim\rm{M}_\odot$/yr for almost 0.5 Gyr beginning at $z\sim7.2$, strongly suggestive that it is the descendant of massive dusty star-forming galaxies at $5<z<7$ recently observed with ALMA. While galaxies with similarly extreme stellar masses are reproduced in some simulations at early times, such a lack of ongoing star formation is not seen there. This suggests the need for a more rapid quenching process than is currently prescribed, challenging our current understanding of how ultra-massive galaxies form and evolve in the early Universe.},

The deep near-IR data select satellites down to log (M/M) {\textgreater} 9 at z {\textless} 3. The radial satellite distribution around centrals is consistent with a projected Navarro-Frenk-White profile. Massive quiescent centrals, log (M/M) {\textgreater} 10.78, have ∼2 times the number of satellites compared to star-forming centrals with a significance of 2.7$\sigma$ even after accounting for differences in the centrals' stellar-mass distributions. We find no statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-mass quiescent and star-forming centrals, 10.48 {\textless} log (M/M) {\textless} 10.78. Compared to the Guo et al. semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicates that quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-forming centrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. We use a simple toy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces the observed quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass between star-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenching probability that increases with halo mass from ∼0 for log (Mh/M) ∼ 11 to ∼1 for log (M h/M) ∼ 13.5. A single halo-mass quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction and satellite distribution of centrals. Therefore, while halo quenching may be an important mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. It remains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even in relatively massive halos. {\textcopyright}2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

abstract = {We derive stellar metallicities, light-weighted ages and stellar masses for a magnitude-limited sample of 175,128 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Two (SDSS DR2). We compute median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the alpha/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. We show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000AA-break strength (D4000). For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed D4000 is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3x10^9<M/Msun<3x10^10. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies.

abstract = {In the early Universe finding massive galaxies that have stopped forming stars present an observational challenge as their rest-frame ultraviolet emission is negligible and they can only be reliably identified by extremely deep near-infrared surveys. These have revealed the presence of massive, quiescent early-type galaxies appearing in the universe as early as z$\sim$2, an epoch 3 Gyr after the Big Bang. Their age and formation processes have now been explained by an improved generation of galaxy formation models where they form rapidly at z$\sim$3-4, consistent with the typical masses and ages derived from their observations. Deeper surveys have now reported evidence for populations of massive, quiescent galaxies at even higher redshifts and earlier times, however the evidence for their existence, and redshift, has relied entirely on coarsely sampled photometry. These early massive, quiescent galaxies are not predicted by the latest generation of theoretical models. Here, we report the spectroscopic confirmation of one of these galaxies at redshift z=3.717 with a stellar mass of 1.7$\times$10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ whose absorption line spectrum shows no current star-formation and which has a derived age of nearly half the age of the Universe at this redshift. The observations demonstrates that the galaxy must have quickly formed the majority of its stars within the first billion years of cosmic history in an extreme and short starburst. This ancestral event is similar to those starting to be found by sub-mm wavelength surveys pointing to a possible connection between these two populations. Early formation of such massive systems is likely to require significant revisions to our picture of early galaxy assembly.},

We quantify the systematic uncertainties related to different criteria to classify star-forming versus quiescent galaxies, different SFR estimates, and by accounting for the star formation measured within different physical apertures. The TNG model returns the observed features of the UVJ diagram at z ≤ 2, with a clear separation between two classes of galaxies. It also returns a tight star-forming main sequence (MS) for $M_{\rm stars}\lt 10^{10.5} \, ({\rm M}_\odot)$ with a ∼0.3 dex scatter at z ∼ 0 in our fiducial choices. If a UVJ-based cut is adopted, the TNG MS exhibits a downwardly bending at stellar masses of about 1010.5−10.7 M⊙. Moreover, the model predicts that ${\sim }80\, (50)$ per cent of 1010.5−11 M⊙ galaxies at z = 0 (z = 2) are quiescent and the numbers of quenched galaxies at intermediate redshifts and high masses are in better agreement with observational estimates than previous models. However, shorter SFR-averaging time-scales imply higher normalizations and scatter of the MS, while smaller apertures lead to underestimating the galaxy SFRs: overall we estimate the inspected systematic uncertainties to sum up to about 0.2−0.3 dex in the locus of the MS and to about 15 percentage points in the fraction of quenched galaxies. While TNG colour distributions are clearly bimodal, this is not the case for the SFR logarithmic distributions in bins of stellar mass (SFR ≳ 10−3 M⊙yr−1). Finally, the slope and z = 0 normalization of the TNG MS are consistent with observational findings; however, the locus of the TNG MS remains lower by about 0.2−0.5 dex at 0.75 ≤ z < 2 than the available observational estimates taken at face value.},

abstract = {We investigate the spatial structure and evolution of star formation and the interstellar medium (ISM) in interacting galaxies. We use an extensive suite of parsec-scale galaxy merger simulations (stellar mass ratio = 2.5:1), which employs the 'Feedback In Realistic Environments-2' model (fire-2). This framework resolves star formation, feedback processes, and the multi-phase structure of the ISM. We focus on the galaxy-pair stages of interaction. We find that close encounters substantially augment cool (HI) and cold-dense (H2) gas budgets, elevating the formation of new stars as a result. This enhancement is centrally-concentrated for the secondary galaxy, and more radially extended for the primary. This behaviour is weakly dependent on orbital geometry. We also find that galaxies with elevated global star formation rate (SFR) experience intense nuclear SFR enhancement, driven by high levels of either star formation efficiency (SFE) or available cold-dense gas fuel. Galaxies with suppressed global SFR also contain a nuclear cold-dense gas reservoir, but low SFE levels diminish SFR in the central region. Concretely, in the majority of cases, SFR-enhancement in the central kiloparsec is fuel-driven (55% for the secondary, 71% for the primary) - whilst central SFR-suppression is efficiency-driven (91% for the secondary, 97% for the primary). Our numerical predictions underscore the need of substantially larger, and/or merger-dedicated, spatially-resolved galaxy surveys - capable of examining vast and diverse samples of interacting systems - coupled with multi-wavelength campaigns aimed to capture their internal ISM structure.},

A simple two-component (accretion, outflow) analytical model generally reproduces the observed line-of-sight kinematics and projected spatial distribution of HI. The best-fitting model suggests that galaxy-scale outflows with initial velocity vout ≃ 600 km s-1 dominate the kinematics of circumgalactic HI out to Dtran ≃ 50 kpc, while HI at Dtran ≳100 kpc is dominated by infall with characteristic vin ≲circular velocity. Over the impact parameter range 80≲Dtran/pkpc ≲ 200, the HI line-of-sight velocity range reaches a minimum, with a corresponding flattening in the rest-frame Ly $\alpha$ equivalent width. These observations can be naturally explained as the transition between outflow-dominated and accretion-dominated flows. Beyond Dtran ≃ 300 pkpc (∼1 cMpc), the line-of-sight kinematics are dominated by Hubble expansion.},

Galaxies residing outside of 2 Rvir of both the cluster centres and additional candidate over-densities are defined as our field sample. Galaxy structural parameters are measured from the COSMOS legacy HST/ACS F814W image. The sizes and Sersic indices of quiescent field and cluster galaxies have the same distribution regardless of Rvir. However, cluster star-forming galaxies within 0.5 Rvir have lower mass-normalised average sizes, by 16{\$}{\{}\backslashpm{\}}7\backslash{\%}{\$}, and a higher fraction of Sersic indices with n{\textgreater}1, than field star-forming galaxies. The average SFRs of star-forming cluster galaxies show a trend of decreasing SFR with clustocentric radius. The mass-normalised average SFR of cluster star-forming galaxies is a factor of 2-2.5 (7-9 sigma) lower than that of star-forming galaxies in the field. While we find no significant dependence on environment for quiescent galaxies, the properties of star-forming galaxies are affected, which could be the result of environment acting on their gas content.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli . We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii , as well as E. coli acrAB , in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli , and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present day and initial mass functions in various components of the Galaxy, disk, spheroid, young and globular clusters. As a general feature, the IMF is well described by a power-law form for $m\ga 1 \msol$ and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk IMF into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one $\sim 0.1 \pc3$. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below $\sim 1 \msol$. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. (shortened)},

This galaxy cluster was first reported in the ZFOURGE survey as harboring evolved massive galaxies using photometric redshifts derived with deep near-infrared (NIR) medium-band filters. We obtain medium-resolution (R ∼ 3600) NIR spectroscopy with MOSFIRE on the Keck 1 telescope and secure 180 redshifts in a 12′ x 12′ region. We find a prominent spike of 57 galaxies at z = 2.095 corresponding to the galaxy cluster. The cluster velocity dispersion is measured to be $\sigma$v1D = 552 ± 52 km s-1. This is the first study of a galaxy cluster in this redshift range (z 2.0) with the combination of spectral resolution (∼26 km s-1) and the number of confirmed members (>50) needed to impose a meaningful constraint on the cluster velocity dispersion and map its members over a large field of view. Our $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation suggests that this cluster will most likely evolve into a Virgo-like cluster with Mvir = 1014.4 (68 confidence) at z ∼ 0. The theoretical probability of finding such a cluster is Our results demonstrate the feasibility of studying galaxy clusters at z > 2 in the same detailed manner using multi-object NIR spectrographs as has been done in the optical in lower-redshift clusters.},

abstract = {In the redshift interval of $2<z<3$, the physical conditions of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) in star-forming galaxies are likely to be different from those in the local Universe because of lower gaseous metallicities, higher gas fractions, and higher star formation activities. In fact, observations suggest that higher electron densities, higher ionization parameters, and harder UV radiation fields are common. In this paper, based on the spectra of H$\alpha$-selected star-forming galaxies at $z=2.5$ taken with Multi-Object Spectrometer for InfraRed Exploration (MOSFIRE) on Keck-1 telescope, we measure electron densities ($n_e$) using the oxygen line ratio ( [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729), and investigate the relationships between the electron density of ionized gas and other physical properties. As a result, we find that the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and the surface density of SFR ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$) are correlated with the electron density at $z=2.5$ for the first time. The $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}-n_e$ relation is likely to be linked to the star formation law in HII regions (where star formation activity is regulated by interstellar pressure). Moreover, we discuss the mode of star formation in those galaxies. The correlation between sSFR and $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ suggests that highly star-forming galaxies (with high sSFR) tend to be characterized by higher surface densities of star formation ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$) and thus higher $n_e$ values as well.},

abstract = {We introduce an updated physical model to simulate the formation and evolution of galaxies in cosmological, large-scale gravity+magnetohydrodynamical simulations with the moving mesh code AREPO. The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and multimode feedback. In this paper, we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances that form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) framework.We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black-hole-driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25Mpc h-1)3 cosmological boxes, we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a selfconsistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of 1012M⊙ haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low-mass end of the galaxy population.},

We use the GIZMO code and the second version of the 'Feedback in Realistic Environments' model (FIRE-2), which captures the multi-phase structure of the ISM. Our simulations are designed to represent galaxy mergers in the local Universe. In this work, we focus on the 'galaxy-pair period' between first and second pericentric passage. We split the ISM into four regimes: hot, warm, cool and cold-dense, motivated by the hot, ionised, atomic and molecular gas phases observed in real galaxies. We find that, on average, interactions enhance the star formation rate of the pair ($\sim$30%, merger-suite sample average) and elevate their cold-dense gas content ($\sim$18%). This is accompanied by a decrease in warm gas ($\sim$11%), a negligible change in cool gas ($\sim$4% increase), and a substantial increase in hot gas ($\sim$400%). The amount of cold-dense gas with densities above 1000 cm^3 (the cold ultra-dense regime) is elevated significantly ($\sim$240%), but only accounts for 0.15% (on average) of the cold-dense gas budget.},

abstract = {Formation of galaxy clusters corresponds to the collapse of the largest gravitationally bound overdensities in the initial density field and is accompanied by the most energetic phenomena since the Big Bang and by the complex interplay between gravity-induced dynamics of collapse and baryonic processes associated with galaxy formation. Galaxy clusters are, thus, at the cross-roads of cosmology and astrophysics and are unique laboratories for testing models of gravitational structure formation, galaxy evolution, thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium, and plasma physics. At the same time, their large masses make them a useful probe of growth of structure over cosmological time, thus providing cosmological constraints that are complementary to other probes. In this review, we describe our current understanding of cluster formation: from the general picture of collapse from initial density fluctuations in an expanding Universe to detailed simulations of cluster formation including the effects of galaxy formation. We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting clusters, their mass function, and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions and the thermodynamical and nonthermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intracluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and, thus, can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in nonstandard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.

abstract = {Tidal forces acting on galaxies in clusters lead to a strong dynamical evolution. In order to quantify the amount of evolution, I run self-consistent N-body simulations of disk galaxies for a variety of models in the hierarchically forming clusters. The tidal field along the galactic orbits is extracted from the simulations of cluster formation in the $\Omega$0=1, 0.4, and 0.4, $\Omega$$\Lambda$=0.6 cosmological scenarios. For large spiral galaxies with a rotation speed of 250 km s-1, tidal interactions truncate massive dark matter halos at 30+/-6 kpc and thicken stellar disks by a factor of 2-3, increasing Toomre's parameter to Q>$\sim$2 and halting star formation. Low-density galaxies, such as the dwarf spheroidals with a circular velocity of 20 km s-1 and the extended low surface brightness galaxies with a scale length of 10-15 kpc, are completely disrupted by tidal shocks. Their debris contribute to the diffuse intracluster light. The tidal effects are significant not only in the core but throughout the cluster and can be parametrized by the critical tidal density. The tidally induced evolution results in the transformation of the infalling spirals into S0 galaxies and in the depletion of the low surface brightness galaxy population. In the low-$\Omega$0 cosmological models, clusters form earlier and produce stronger evolution of galaxies.},

These measurements constrain the internal dynamics, the intrinsic velocity dispersions ($\sigma$int) and rotation velocities (VC) of galaxies in the high-redshift Universe. The mean velocity dispersion of the galaxies in our sample is $\sigma$int = 70.8 -3.1+3.3 km s-1, revealing that the increasing average $\sigma$int with increasing redshift, reported for z≲2, continues out to z ≃ 3.5. Only 36 ± 8 per cent of our galaxies are rotation-dominated (VC/$\sigma$ int > 1), with the sample average VC/$\sigma$ int value much smaller than at lower redshift. After carefully selecting comparable star-forming samples at multiple epochs, we find that the rotationdominated fraction evolves with redshift with a z-0.2 dependence. The rotation-dominated KDS galaxies show no clear offset from the local rotation velocity-stellar mass (i.e. VC-M*) relation, although a smaller fraction of the galaxies are on the relation due to the increase in the dispersion-dominated fraction. These observations are consistent with a simple equilibrium model picture, in which random motions are boosted in high-redshift galaxies by a combination of the increasing gas fractions, accretion efficiency, specific star formation rate and stellar feedback and which may provide significant pressure support against gravity on the galactic disc scale.},

abstract = {We use our state-of-the-art semi-analytic model for GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA), and observational measurements of nearby galaxies to study the influence of the environment on the gas content and gaseous/stellar disc sizes of star-forming galaxies. We analyse the origin of differences between physical properties of satellites and those of their central counterparts, identified by matching the Vmax of their host haloes at the accretion time of the satellites. Our model nicely reproduces the differences between centrals and satellites measured for the HI mass, size of the star-forming region, and stellar radii. In contrast, our model predicts larger differences with respect to data for the molecular gas mass and star formation rate. By analysing the progenitors of central and satellite model galaxies, we find that differences in the gas content arise after accretion, and can be entirely ascribed to the instantaneous stripping of the hot gas reservoir. The suppression of cold gas replenishment via cooling and star formation leads to a reduction of the cold gas and of its density. Therefore, more molecular gas is lost than lower density HI gas, and model satellites have less molecular gas and lower star formation rates than observed satellites. We argue that these disagreements could be largely resolved with the inclusion of a proper treatment for ram-pressure stripping of cold gas and a more gradual stripping of the hot gas reservoir. A more sophisticated treatment of angular momentum exchanges, accounting for the multi-phase nature of the gaseous disc, is also required.},

abstract = {We describe the Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS (CSI) Survey, a wide-field, near-IR selected spectrophotometric redshift survey with the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) on Magellan-Baade. By defining a flux-limited sample of galaxies in Spitzer Infrared Array Camera 3.6 $\mu$m imaging of SWIRE fields, the CSI Survey efficiently traces the stellar mass of average galaxies to z ∼ 1.5. This first paper provides an overview of the survey selection, observations, processing of the photometry and spectrophotometry. We also describe the processing of the data: new methods of fitting synthetic templates of spectral energy distributions are used to derive redshifts, stellar masses, emission line luminosities, and coarse information on recent star formation. Our unique methodology for analyzing low-dispersion spectra taken with multilayer prisms in IMACS, combined with panchromatic photometry from the ultraviolet to the IR, has yielded high-quality redshifts for 43,347 galaxies in our first 5.3 deg2 of the SWIRE XMM-LSS field. We use three different approaches to estimate our redshift errors and find robust agreement. Over the full range of 3.6 $\mu$m fluxes of our selection, we find typical redshift uncertainties of $\sigma$z /(1 + z) ≲ 0.015. In comparisons with previously published spectroscopic redshifts we find scatters of $\sigma$z /(1 + z) = 0.011 for galaxies at 0.7 ≤ z ≤ 0.9, and $\sigma$z /(1 + z) = 0.014 for galaxies at 0.9 ≤ z ≤ 1.2. For galaxies brighter and fainter than i = 23 mag, we find $\sigma$z /(1 + z) = 0.008 and $\sigma$z /(1 + z) = 0.022, respectively. Notably, our low-dispersion spectroscopy and analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and success rates for both red and blue galaxies, largely eliminating color-based systematics that can seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution on environment. {\textcopyright} 2014.

In recent years this component of galaxies has assumed an important role in our understanding of galaxy evolution owing to rapid advances in observational access to this diffuse, nearly invisible material. Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions for future research.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate environment-driven gas depletion in satellite galaxies, taking full advantage of the atomic hydrogen (H I) spectral stacking technique to quantify the gas content for the entire gas-poor to -rich regimes. We do so using a multiwavelength sample of 10 600 satellite galaxies, selected according to stellar mass (log M★/M☉ ≥ 9) and redshift (0.02 ≤ z ≤ 0.05) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with H I data from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. Using key H I-to-stellar mass scaling relations, we present evidence that the gas content of satellite galaxies is, to a significant extent, dependent on the environment in which a galaxy resides. For the first time, we demonstrate that systematic environmental suppression of gas content at both fixed stellar mass and fixed specific star formation rate in satellite galaxies begins in halo masses typical of the group regime (log Mh/M☉ < 13.5), well before galaxies reach the cluster environment. We also show that environment-driven gas depletion is more closely associated with halo mass than local density. Our results are then compared with state-of-the-art semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations and discussed within this framework, showing that more work is needed if models are to reproduce the observations. We conclude that the observed decrease of gas content in the group and cluster environments cannot be reproduced by starvation of the gas supply alone and invoke fast acting processes such as ram-pressure stripping of cold gas to explain this.},

abstract = {Using high resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, we study the gas accretion history of low mass halos located in a field-like, low density environment. We track their evolution individually from the early, pre-reionization era, through reionization, and beyond until $z=0$. Before reionization, low mass halos accrete cool cosmic web gas at a very rapid rate, often reaching the highest gas mass they will ever have. But when reionization occurs, we see that almost all halos lose significant quantities of their gas content, although some respond less quickly than others. We find that the response rate is influenced by halo mass first, and secondarily by their internal gas density at the epoch of reionization. Reionization also fully ionises the cosmic web gas by z$\sim$6. As a result, the lowest mass halos (M$\sim$10$^6\simh^{-1}$M$_\odot$ at $z=6$) can never again re-accrete gas from the cosmic web, and by $z\sim5$ have lost all their internal gas to ionisation, resulting in a halt in star formation at this epoch. However, more massive halos can recover from their gas mass loss, and re-accrete ionised cosmic web gas. We find the efficiency of this re-accretion is a function of halo mass first, followed by local surrounding gas density. Halos that are closer to the cosmic web structure can accrete denser gas more rapidly. We find that our lower mass halos have a sweet spot for rapid, dense gas accretion at distances of roughly 1-5 virial radii from the most massive halos in our sample ($>$10$^8\simh^{-1}$M$_\odot$), as these tend to be embedded deeply within the cosmic web.},

abstract = {In the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation, a galaxy overdensity is a hallmark of a massive cosmic structure. However, it is less well understood how different types of galaxies trace the underlying large-scale structure. Motivated by the discovery of a z=3.13 protocluster, we examine how the same structure is populated by Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs). To this end, we have undertaken a deep narrow-band imaging survey sampling Ly$\alpha$ emission at this redshift. Of the 93 LAE candidates within a 36'x36'$\sim$(70x70$\sim$Mpc^2) field, 21 galaxies form a significant surface overdensity (delta_g=3.3+/-0.9), which is spatially segregated from the Lyman break galaxy (LBG) overdensity. One possible interpretation is that they trace two separate structures of comparable masses ($\sim$ 10^{15}M_sun) where the latter is hosted by a halo assembled at an earlier time. We speculate that the dearth of LAEs in the LBG overdensity region may signal the role of halo assembly bias in galaxy formation, which would suggest that different search techniques may be biased accordingly to the formation age or dynamical state of the host halo. The median Ly$\alpha$- and UV luminosity is 30--70\% higher for the protocluster LAEs relative to the field. This difference cannot be explained by the galaxy overdensity alone, and may require a top-heavy mass function, higher star formation efficiency for protocluster halos, or suppression of galaxy formation in low-mass halos. A luminous Ly$\alpha$ blob and an ultramassive galaxy found in this region paint a picture consistent with the expected early growth of galaxies in clusters.},

abstract = {We have modeled a large sample of infrared starburst galaxies using both the PEGASE v2.0 and STARBURST99 codes to generate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the young star clusters. PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks, while STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allow-ing comparison between the two. We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models that include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the stan-dard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV radiation Ðeld in these gal-axies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation Ðeld in the 1{\`{E}}4 ryd region. We Ðnd that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard EUV Ðeld in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in the 1{\`{E}}4 ryd range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this discrepancy is most likely due to the di erences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R stars. The PEGASE models use the Clegg & Middlemass planetary nebula nuclei (PNN) atmosphere models for the W-R stars, whereas the STARBURST99 models use the Schmutz, Leitherer, & Gruenwald W-R atmosphere models. We believe that the Schmutz et al. atmospheres are more applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample ; however, they do not produce the hard EUV Ðeld in the 1{\`{E}}4 ryd region required by our observations. The inclusion of continuum metal blanketing in the models may be one solution. Supernova remnant (SNR) shock modeling shows that the contribution by mechanical energy from SNRs to the photoionization models is >20%. The models presented here are used to derive a new theoretical classiÐcation scheme for starbursts and active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies based on the optical diagnostic diagrams.},

abstract = {One of the key open questions in extragalactic astronomy is what stops star formation in galaxies. While it is clear that the cold gas reservoir, which fuels the formation of new stars, must be affected first, how this happens and what are the dominant physical mechanisms involved is still a matter of debate. At least for satellite galaxies, it is generally accepted that internal processes alone cannot be responsible for fully quenching their star formation, but that environment should play an important, if not dominant, role. In nearby clusters, we see examples of cold gas being removed from the star-forming discs of galaxies moving through the intracluster medium, but whether active stripping is widespread and/or necessary to halt star formation in satellites, or quenching is just a consequence of the inability of these galaxies to replenish their cold gas reservoirs, remains unclear. In this work, we review the current status of environmental studies of cold gas in star-forming satellites in the local Universe from an observational perspective, focusing on the evidence for a physical link between cold gas stripping and quenching of the star formation. We find that stripping of cold gas is ubiquitous in satellite galaxies in both group and cluster environments. While hydrodynamical mechanisms such as ram pressure are important, the emerging picture across the full range of dark matter halos and stellar masses is a complex one, where different physical mechanisms may act simultaneously and cannot always be easily separated. Most importantly, we show that stripping does not always lead to full quenching, as only a fraction of the cold gas reservoir might be affected at the first pericentre passage. We argue that this is a key point to reconcile apparent tensions between statistical and detailed analyses of satellite galaxies, as well as disagreements between various estimates of quenching timescales. We conclude by highlighting several outstanding questions where we expect to see substantial progress in the coming decades, thanks to the advent of the Square Kilometre Array and its precursors, as well as the next-generation optical and millimeter facilities.},

We find that the 'two-phase' picture of galaxy formation predicted by some models is a good approximation only for the most massive galaxies in our simulation - namely, the stellar mass growth of galaxies below a few times 1011M⊙ is dominated by in situ star formation at all redshifts. The fraction of the total stellar mass of galaxies at z = 0 contributed by accreted stars shows a strong dependence on galaxy stellar mass, ranging from about 10 per cent for Milky Way-sized galaxies to over 80 per cent for M* ≈ 1012M⊙ objects, yet with a large galaxy-to-galaxy variation. At a fixed stellar mass, elliptical galaxies and those formed at the centres of younger haloes exhibit larger fractions of ex situ stars than disc-like galaxies and those formed in older haloes. On average, $\sim$50 per cent of the ex situ stellar mass comes from major mergers (stellar mass ratio $\mu$ > 1/4), $\sim$20 per cent from minor mergers (1/10 < $\mu$ < 1/4), $\sim$20 per cent from very minor mergers ($\mu$ < 1/10), and $\sim$10 per cent from stars that were stripped from surviving galaxies (e.g. flybys or ongoing mergers). These components are spatially segregated, with in situ stars dominating the innermost regions of galaxies, and ex situ stars being deposited at larger galactocentric distances in order of decreasing merger mass ratio.},

abstract = {We report the first results from the Z -FOURGE survey: the discovery of a candidate galaxy cluster at z = 2.2 consisting of two compact overdensities with red galaxies detected at ≳ 20$\sigma$ above the mean surface density. The discovery was made possible by a new deep (Ks ≲ 24.8 AB 5$\sigma$) Magellan/FOURSTAR near-IR imaging survey with five custom medium-bandwidth filters. The filters pinpoint the location of the Balmer/4000 break in evolved stellar populations at 1.5 < z < 3.5, yielding significantly more accurate photometric redshifts than possible with broadband imaging alone. The overdensities are within 1′ of each other in the COSMOS field and appear to be embedded in a larger structure that contains at least one additional overdensity (10$\sigma$). Considering the global properties of the overdensities, the z = 2.2 system appears to be the most distant example of a galaxy cluster with a population of red galaxies. A comparison to a large $\Lambda$CDM simulation suggests that the system may consist of merging subclusters, with properties in between those of z > 2 protoclusters with more diffuse distributions of blue galaxies and the lower-redshift galaxy clusters with prominent red sequences. The structure is completely absent in public optical catalogs in COSMOS and only weakly visible in a shallower near-IR survey. The discovery showcases the potential of deep near-IR surveys with medium-band filters to advance the understanding of environment and galaxy evolution at z > 1.5. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Local galaxies are broadly divided into two main classes, star-forming (gas-rich) and quiescent (passive and gas-poor). The primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into quiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through outflows or stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative mechanism is so-called "strangulation", in which the supply of cold gas to the galaxy is halted. Here we report that the difference between quiescent and star forming galaxies in terms of stellar metallicity (i.e. the fraction of metals heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) can be used to discriminate efficiently between the two mechanisms. The analysis of the stellar metallicity in local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, clearly reveals that strangulation is the primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical timescale of 4 billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass less than 10^11 solar masses. This result is further supported independently by the stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which indicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 10^11 solar masses are on average observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.},

abstract = {Star formation is observed to be suppressed in group and cluster galaxies compared to the field. To gain insight into the quenching process, we have analysed $\sim$2000 galaxies formed in the GIMIC suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The time of quenching varies from $\sim$2Gyr before accretion (first crossing of r200, c) to>4 Gyr after, depending on satellite and host mass. Once begun, quenching is rapid ( 500 Myr) in low-mass galaxies (Mstar < 1010M), but significantly more protracted formoremassive satellites. The simulations predict a substantial role of outflows driven by ram pressure - but not tidal forces - in removing the star-forming interstellar matter (ISM) from satellite galaxies, especially dwarfs (Mstar ≈ 109M) where they account for nearly two thirds of ISM loss in both groups and clusters. Immediately before quenching is complete, this fraction rises to $\sim$80 per cent even for Milky Way analogues (Mstar ≈ 1010.5M) in groups (Mhost ≈ 1013.5M). We show that (i) ISM stripping was significantly more effective at early times than at z = 0; (ii) approximately half the gas is stripped from 'galactic fountains' and half directly from the star-forming disc; (iii) galaxies undergoing stripping experience ram pressure up to $\sim$100 times the average at a given group-/clustercentric radius, because they are preferentially located in overdense regions of the intracluster medium. Remarkably, stripping causes at most half the loss of the extended gas haloes surrounding our simulated satellites. These results contrast sharply with the current picture of strangulation - removal of the ISM through star formation after stripping of the hot halo - being the dominant mechanism quenching group and cluster satellites.},

abstract = {We present reduced data and data products from the 3D-HST survey, a 248-orbit HST Treasury program. The survey obtained WFC3 G141 grism spectroscopy in four of the five CANDELS fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS, along with WFC3 {\$}H{\_}{\{}140{\}}{\$} imaging, parallel ACS G800L spectroscopy, and parallel {\$}I{\_}{\{}814{\}}{\$} imaging. In a previous paper (Skelton et al. 2014) we presented photometric catalogs in these four fields and in GOODS-N, the fifth CANDELS field. Here we describe and present the WFC3 G141 spectroscopic data, again augmented with data from GO-1600 in GOODS-N. The data analysis is complicated by the fact that no slits are used: all objects in the WFC3 field are dispersed, and many spectra overlap. We developed software to automatically and optimally extract interlaced 2D and 1D spectra for all objects in the Skelton et al. (2014) photometric catalogs. The 2D spectra and the multi-band photometry were fit simultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking the morphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. The resulting catalog has 98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to {\$}JH{\_}{\{}IR{\}}\backslashleq 26{\$} and 22,548 with {\$}JH{\_}{\{}IR{\}}\backslashleq 24{\$}, where we comfortably detect continuum emission.

abstract = {Context. Studying the evolution of galaxies located within groups may have important implications for our understanding of the global evolution of the galaxy population as a whole. The fraction of galaxies bound in groups at z ∼ 0 is as high as 60% and therefore any mechanism (among the many suggested) that could quench star formation when a galaxy enters group environment would be an important driver for galaxy evolution. Aims. Using the group catalog obtained from zCOSMOS spectroscopic data and the complementary photometric data from the COSMOS survey, we explore segregation effects occurring in groups of galaxies at intermediate/high redshifts. Our aim is to reveal if, and how significantly, group environment affects the evolution of infalling galaxies. Methods. We built two composite groups at intermediate (0.2 ≤ z ≤ 0.45) and high (0.45 < z ≤ 0.8) redshifts, and we divided the corresponding composite group galaxies into three samples according to their distance from the group center. The samples roughly correspond to galaxies located in a group's inner core, intermediate, and infall region. We explored how galaxy stellar masses and colors-working in narrow bins of stellar masses-vary as a function of the galaxy distance from the group center. Results. We found that the most massive galaxies in our sample (log(M gal/M ⊙) ≥ 10.6) do not display any strong group-centric dependence of the fractions of red/blue objects. For galaxies of lower masses (9.8 ≤ log(M gal/M ⊙) ≤ 10.6) there is a radial dependence in the changing mix of red and blue galaxies. This dependence is most evident in poor groups, whereas richer groups do not display any obvious trend of the blue fraction. Interestingly, mass segregation shows the opposite behavior: it is visible only in rich groups, while poorer groups have a a constant mix of galaxy stellar masses as a function of radius. Conclusions. These findings can be explained in a simple scenario where color-and mass-segregation originate from different physical processes. While dynamical friction is the obvious cause for establishing mass segregation, both starvation and galaxy-galaxy collisions are plausible mechanisms to quench star formation in groups at a faster rate than in the field. In poorer groups the environmental effects are caught in action superimposed to secular galaxy evolution. Their member galaxies display increasing blue fractions when moving from the group center to more external regions, presumably reflecting the recent accretion history of these groups. {\textcopyright} 2012 ESO.},

abstract = {The process that quenched star formation in galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts is still the subject of considerable debate. One way to investigate this puzzling issue is to study the number density of quiescent galaxies at z ≃ 2 and its dependence on mass. Here we present the results of a new study based on very deep Ks-band imaging (with the HAWK-I instrument on the VLT) of two HST CANDELS fields (the UKIDSS Ultra-deep survey (UDS) field and GOODS-South). The new HAWK-I data (taken as part of the HUGS VLT Large Program) reach detection limits of Ks > 26 (AB mag). We have combined this imaging with the other ground-based and HST data in the CANDELS fields to select a sample of passively-evolving galaxies in the redshift range 1.4 < z < 2.5 (via the pBzK color-based selection criterion). Thanks to the depth and wide area coverage of our imaging, we have been able to extend the selection of quiescent galaxies to a magnitude fainter than previous analyses. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, that the observed turnover in the number of quiescent galaxies at K > 22 is not due to incompleteness, but is real. This has enabled us to establish unambiguously that the number counts of quiescent galaxies at z - 2 flatten and slightly decline at magnitudes fainter than Ks ∼ 22 (AB mag.), in contrast to the number density of star-forming galaxies, which continues to rise to fainter magnitudes. We show that this trend corresponds to a stellar mass threshold M∗ ≃ 1010.8 M⊙ below which the mechanism that halts the star formation in high-redshift galaxies seems to be inefficient. We also show that, while pBzK galaxies at K < 23 are in the redshift range 1.4 < z < 2.5, as expected, at K > 23 a higher redshift population of z ≃ 3 pBzK galaxies is detected and dominates the counts at the faintest magnitudes. Finally, we compare the observed pBzK number counts with those of quiescent galaxies extracted from four different semi-analytic models. We find that only two of these models reproduce the observed trend in the number counts, even qualitatively, and that none of the models provides a statistically acceptable description of the number density of quiescent galaxies at these redshifts. We conclude that the mass function of quiescent galaxies as a function of redshift continues to present a key and demanding challenge for proposed models of galaxy formation and evolution.},

We use a homogeneously selected sample of field and cluster galaxies whose membership is derived from dynamical analysis. Using [$\rm{O{\small II}}$]-derived star formation rates (SFRs), we find that cluster galaxies have suppressed SFRs at fixed stellar mass in comparison to their field counterparts by a factor of 1.4 ± 0.1 (∼3.3$\sigma$) across the stellar mass range: 9.0 < log (M*/M⊙) < 11.2. We also find that this modest suppression in the cluster galaxy star-forming main sequence is mass and redshift dependent: the difference between cluster and field increases towards lower stellar masses and lower redshift. When comparing the distribution of cluster and field galaxy SFRs to the star-forming main sequence, we find an overall shift towards lower SFRs in the cluster population, and note the absence of a tail of high SFR galaxies as seen in the field. Given this observed suppression in the cluster galaxy star-forming main sequence, we explore the implications for several scenarios such as formation time differences between cluster and field galaxies, and environmentally induced star formation quenching and associated time-scales.},

abstract = {We introduce the Hydrangea simulations, a suite of 24 cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of massive galaxy clusters (M_200c = 10^14-10^15 M_Sun) with baryon particle masses of $\sim$10^6 M_Sun. Designed to study the impact of the cluster environment on galaxy formation, they are a key part of the `Cluster-EAGLE' project (Barnes et al. 2017). They use a galaxy formation model developed for the EAGLE project, which has been shown to yield both realistic field galaxies and hot gas fractions of galaxy groups consistent with observations. The total stellar mass content of the simulated clusters agrees with observations, but central cluster galaxies are too massive, by up to 0.6 dex. Passive satellite fractions are higher than in the field, and at stellar masses Mstar > 10^10 M_Sun this environmental effect is quantitatively consistent with observations. The predicted satellite stellar mass function matches data from local cluster surveys. Normalized to total mass, there are fewer low-mass (Mstar < 10^10 M_Sun) galaxies within the virial radius of clusters than in the field, primarily due to star formation quenching. Conversely, the simulations predict an overabundance of massive galaxies in clusters compared to the field that persists to their far outskirts (> 5r_200c). This is caused by a significantly increased stellar mass fraction of (sub-)haloes in the cluster environment, by up to $\sim$0.3 dex even well beyond r_200c. Haloes near clusters are also more concentrated than equally massive field haloes, but these two effects are largely uncorrelated.},

abstract = {We present Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation, or BAGPIPES, a new PYTHON tool that can be used to rapidly generate complex model galaxy spectra and to fit these to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric data using the MULTINEST nested sampling algorithm. We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star formation histories (SFHs) by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9289 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, M* > 1010M⊙ and redshifts 0.25 < z < 3.75. Themajority of our sample exhibit SFHs that rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly over 1-2 Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. At z > 1, we also find a class of objects with SFHs that rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching time-scales of < 1 Gyr, consistent with quasar-mode AGN feedback. Finally, at z < 1 we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over > 3 Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. We confirm the mass-accelerated evolution (downsizing) trend, and a trend towards more rapid quenching at higher stellar masses. However, our results suggest that the latter is a natural consequence of mass-accelerated evolution, rather than a change in quenching physics with stellar mass. We find 61 ± 8 per cent of z > 1.5 massive-quenched galaxies undergo significant further evolution by z = 0.5. BAGPIPES is available at bagpipes.readthedocs.io.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, increasingly robust estimates of the dense molecular gas content in galaxy populations between redshift z = 0 and the peak of cosmic galaxy/star formation (z ∼ 1-3) have become available. This rapid progress has been possible due to the advent of powerful ground- and space-based telescopes for the combined study of several millimeter to far-IR, line or continuum tracers of the molecular gas and dust components. The main conclusions of this review are as follows: ▪Star-forming galaxies contained much more molecular gas at earlier cosmic epochs than at the present time. ▪The galaxy-integrated depletion timescale for converting the gas into stars depends primarily on z or Hubble time and, at a given z, on the vertical location of a galaxy along the star-formation rate versus stellar mass main sequence (MS) correlation. ▪Global rates of galaxy gas accretion primarily control the evolution of the cold molecular gas content and star-formation rates of the dominant MS galaxy population, which in turn vary with cosmological expansion. Another key driver may be global disk fragmentation in high-z, gas-rich galaxies, which ties local free-fall timescales to galactic orbital times and leads to rapid radial matter transport and bulge growth. The low star-formation efficiency inside molecular clouds is plausibly set by supersonic streaming motions and internal turbulence, which in turn may be driven by conversion of gravitational energy at high z and/or by local feedback from massive stars at low z. ▪A simple gas regulator model is remarkably successful in predicting the combined evolution of molecular gas fractions, star-formation rates, galactic winds, and gas-phase metallicities.},

abstract = {Using deep multi-wavelength photometry of galaxies from ZFOURGE, we group galaxies at $2.5<z<4.0$ by the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We identify a population of galaxies with excess emission in the $K_s$-band, which corresponds to [OIII]+H$\beta$ emission at $2.95<z<3.65$. This population includes 78% of the bluest galaxies with UV slopes steeper than $\beta = -2$. We de-redshift and scale this photometry to build two composite SEDs, enabling us to measure equivalent widths of these Extreme [OIII]+H$\beta$ Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) at $z\sim3.5$. We identify 60 galaxies that comprise a composite SED with [OIII]+H$\beta$ rest-frame equivalent width of $803\pm228$\AA\ and another 218 galaxies in a composite SED with equivalent width of $230\pm90$\AA. These EELGs are analogous to the `green peas' found in the SDSS, and are thought to be undergoing their first burst of star formation due to their blue colors ($\beta < -1.6$), young ages ($\log(\rm{age}/yr)\sim7.2$), and low dust attenuation values. Their strong nebular emission lines and compact sizes (typically $\sim1.4$ kpc) are consistent with the properties of the star-forming galaxies possibly responsible for reionizing the universe at $z>6$. Many of the EELGs also exhibit Lyman-$\alpha$ emission. Additionally, we find that many of these sources are clustered in an overdensity in the Chandra Deep Field South, with five spectroscopically confirmed members at $z=3.474 \pm 0.004$. The spatial distribution and photometric redshifts of the ZFOURGE population further confirm the overdensity highlighted by the EELGs.},

All 19 spirals were observed at the position of their optical center and for a subset, at multiple positions. For each spiral the integrated CO (J = 1 - 0) intensity from the central pointing, in few cases supplemented with intensities from offset pointings, was used to estimate its molecular hydrogen mass and H_2 deficiency. Accepting the considerable uncertainties involved in determining H_2 deficiencies, spirals previously identified by us to have redder colours and higher HI deficiencies as a result of environmental influence, were found to be more H_2 deficient compared to members of the sample in less advanced evolutionary states. For eight of the observed spirals multiple pointing observations were made to investigate the distribution of their molecular gas. For these spirals we fitted Gaussians to the CO intensities projected in a line across the galaxy. In two cases, CGCG 097-079 and CGCG 097-102(N), the offset between the CO and optical intensity maxima was significantly larger than the pointing uncertainty and the FWHMs of the fits were significantly greater than those of the other spirals, irrespective of optical size. Both signatures are indicators of an abnormal molecular gas distribution. In the case of CGCG 097-079, which is considered an archetype for ram pressure stripping, our observations indicate the CO intensity maximum lies $\sim$ 15.6 +/- 8.5 arcsec (6 kpc) NW of the optical centre at the same projected position as the HI intensity maximum.},

abstract = {We study galactic star-formation activity as a function of environment and stellar mass over 0.5<z<2.0 using the FourStar Galaxy Evolution (ZFOURGE) survey. We estimate the galaxy environment using a Bayesian-motivated measure of the distance to the third nearest neighbor for galaxies to the stellar mass completeness of our survey, $\log(M/M_\odot)>9 (9.5)$ at z=1.3 (2.0). This method, when applied to a mock catalog with the photometric-redshift precision ($\sigma_z / (1+z) \lesssim 0.02$), recovers galaxies in low- and high-density environments accurately. We quantify the environmental quenching efficiency, and show that at z> 0.5 it depends on galaxy stellar mass, demonstrating that the effects of quenching related to (stellar) mass and environment are not separable. In high-density environments, the mass and environmental quenching efficiencies are comparable for massive galaxies ($\log (M/M_\odot)\gtrsim$ 10.5) at all redshifts. For lower mass galaxies ($\log (M/M)_\odot) \lesssim$ 10), the environmental quenching efficiency is very low at $z\gtrsim$ 1.5, but increases rapidly with decreasing redshift. Environmental quenching can account for nearly all quiescent lower mass galaxies ($\log(M/M_\odot) \sim$ 9-10), which appear primarily at $z\lesssim$ 1.0. The morphologies of lower mass quiescent galaxies are inconsistent with those expected of recently quenched star-forming galaxies. Some environmental process must transform the morphologies on similar timescales as the environmental quenching itself. The evolution of the environmental quenching favors models that combine gas starvation (as galaxies become satellites) with gas exhaustion through star-formation and outflows ("overconsumption"), and additional processes such as galaxy interactions, tidal stripping and disk fading to account for the morphological differences between the quiescent and star-forming galaxy populations.},

We determine the SFHs of individual galaxies by simultaneously fitting rest-frame optical spectroscopy and broadband photometry to stellar population models. We confirm that the SFHs are consistent with more massive galaxies having on average earlier formation times. Comparing galaxies found in massive clusters with those in the field, we find galaxies with M* < 1011.3 M⊙ in the field have more extended SFHs. From the SFHs we calculate the mass-weighted ages, and compare age distributions of galaxies between the two environments, at fixed mass. We constrain the difference in mass-weighted ages between field and cluster galaxies to $0.31_{^{-0.33}}^{_{+0.51}}$ Gyr, in the sense that cluster galaxies are older. We place this result in the context of two simple quenching models and show that neither environmental quenching based on time since infall (without pre-processing) nor a difference in formation times alone can reproduce both the average age difference and relative quenched fractions. This is distinctly different from local clusters, for which the majority of the quenched population is consistent with having been environmentally quenched upon infall. Our results suggest that quenched population in galaxy clusters at z >1 has been driven by different physical processes than those at play at z = 0.},

Theoretical predictions have so far led to contradictory conclusions about whether ram pressure can enhance the star formation in the gas disks and tails or not and until now a statistically significant observed sample of stripping galaxies was lacking. We find that stripping galaxies occupy the upper envelope of the control sample SFR-M{\_}ast relation, showing a systematic enhancement of the SFR at any given mass. The star formation enhancement occurs in the disk (0.2 dex), and additional star formation takes place in the tails. Our results suggest that strong ram pressure stripping events can moderately enhance the star formation also in the disk prior to gas removal.},

abstract = {We investigate active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates within the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) to determine the impact they have on star formation in their host galaxies. We first identify a population of radio, X-ray, and infrared-selected AGN by cross-matching the deep Ks-band imaging of ZFOURGE with overlapping multiwavelength data. From this, we construct a mass-complete (log(M*/M⊙) =9.75), AGN luminosity limited sample of 235 AGN hosts over z = 0.2-3.2. We compare the rest-frame U - V versus V - J (UVJ) colours and specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of the AGN hosts to a mass-matched control sample of inactive (non-AGN) galaxies. UVJ diagnostics reveal AGN tend to be hosted in a lower fraction of quiescent galaxies and a higher fraction of dusty galaxies than the control sample. Using 160 $\mu$m Herschel PACS data, we find the mean specific star formation rate of AGN hosts to be elevated by 0.34 ± 0.07 dex with respect to the control sample across all redshifts. This offset is primarily driven by infrared-selected AGN, where the mean sSFR is found to be elevated by as much as a factor of $\sim$5. The remaining population, comprised predominantly of X-ray AGN hosts, is found mostly consistent with inactive galaxies, exhibiting only a marginal elevation. We discuss scenarios that may explain these findings and postulate that AGN are less likely to be a dominant mechanism for moderating galaxy growth via quenching than has previously been suggested.},

abstract = {We examine the origin of clustercentric gradients in the star formation rates and colors of rich cluster galaxies within the context of a simple model where clusters are built through the ongoing accretion of field galaxies. The model assumes that after galaxies enter the cluster their star formation rates decline on a timescale of a few Gyrs, the typical gas consumption timescale of disk galaxies in the field. Such behaviour might be expected if tides and ram pressure strip off the gaseous envelopes that normally fuel star formation in spirals over a Hubble time. Combining these timescales with mass accretion histories derived from N-body simulations of cluster formation in a Lambda-CDM universe, we reproduce the systematic differences observed in the color distribution of cluster and field galaxies, as well as the strong suppression of star formation in cluster galaxies and its dependence on clustercentric radius. The simulations also indicate that a significant fraction of galaxies beyond the virial radius of the cluster may have been within the main body of the cluster in the past, a result that explains naturally why star formation in the outskirts of clusters (and as far out as two virial radii) is systematically suppressed relative to the field. The agreement with the data beyond the cluster virial radius is also improved if we assume that stripping happens within lower mass systems, before the galaxy is accreted into the main body of the cluster. We conclude that the star formation rates of cluster galaxies depend primarily on the time elapsed since their accretion onto massive virialized systems, and that the cessation of star formation may have taken place gradually over a few Gyrs.},

abstract = {Galaxy clusters grow by accreting galaxies from the field and along filaments of the cosmic web. As galaxies are accreted they are affected by their local environment before they enter (pre-processing), and traverse the cluster potential. Observations that aim to constrain pre-processing are challenging to interpret because filaments comprise a heterogeneous range of environments including groups of galaxies embedded within them and backsplash galaxies that contain a record of their previous passage through the cluster. This motivates using modern cosmological simulations to dissect the population of galaxies found in filaments that are feeding clusters, to better understand their history, and aid the interpretation of observations. We use zoom-in simulations from The ThreeHundred project to track haloes through time and identify their environment. We establish a benchmark for galaxies in cluster infall regions that supports the reconstruction of the different modes of pre-processing. We find that up to 45 per cent of all galaxies fall into clusters via filaments (closer than 1 h−1Mpc from the filament spine). 12 per cent of these filament galaxies are long-established members of groups and between 30 and 60 per cent of filament galaxies at R200 are backsplash galaxies. This number depends on the cluster's dynamical state and sharply drops with distance. Backsplash galaxies return to clusters after deflecting widely from their entry trajectory, especially in relaxed clusters. They do not have a preferential location with respect to filaments and cannot collapse to form filaments. The remaining pristine galaxies (∼30–60 per cent) are environmentally affected by cosmic filaments alone.},

The analytic model has been set to match the evolution of the global stellar mass function since redshift {\$}z\backslashsim 2.3{\$} and give reasonable predictions of the star formation history of galaxies at the same time. We find that stellar mass and environment play different roles: the star formation rate/specific star formation rate-{\$}M{\_}*{\$} relations are independent of the environment (defined as the halo mass) at any redshift probed, {\$}0{\textless}z{\textless}1.5{\$}, for both star forming and quiescent galaxies, while the star formation rate-{\$}M{\_}{\{}halo{\}}{\$} relation strongly depends on stellar mass in the same redshift range, for both star forming and quiescent galaxies. Moreover, the star formation rate and the specific star formation rate are strongly dependent on stellar mass even when the distance from the cluster core is used as a proxy for the environment, rather than the halo mass. We then conclude that stellar mass is the main driver of galaxy quenching at any redshift probed in this study, not just at {\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$} as generally claimed, while the environment has a minimal role. All the physical processes linked to the environment must act on very short timescales, such that they do not influence the star formation of active galaxies, but increase the probability of a given galaxy to become quiescent.},

abstract = {The clustering of dark haloes depends not only on their mass but also on their assembly history, a dependence we term 'assembly bias'. Using a galaxy formation model grafted on to the Millennium Simulation of the ACDM cosmogony, we study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original simulation to 'shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly swapped among haloes of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations between assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are ignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark matter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more realistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances two-point correlations by 10 per cent for galaxies with MbJ - 5 log h brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar amount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour, assembly bias is 5 per cent stronger for red galaxies and 5 per cent weaker for blue ones. Halo central galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of all types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central galaxies. Shuffling galaxies among haloes of fixed formation redshift or concentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much smaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation of environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of these parameters. It induces effects which could compromise precision measurements of cosmological parameters from large galaxy surveys. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {Recently a number of studies have found a similarity between the passive fraction of central and satellite galaxies when controlled for both stellar and halo mass. These results suggest that the quenching processes that affect galaxies are largely agnostic to central/satellite status, which contradicts the traditional picture of increased satellite quenching via environmental processes such as stripping, strangulation and starvation. Here we explore this further using the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey which extends to $\sim$2dex lower in stellar mass than SDSS, is more complete for closely-separated galaxies (>95% compared to >70%), and identifies lower-halo-mass groups outside of the very local Universe (M$_{\backslashmathrm{\{}halo{\}}}\backslashsim10^{12}$M$_{\backslashodot{\}}$ at $0.1<z<0.2$). As far as possible we aim to replicate the selections, completeness corrections and central/satellite division of one of the previous studies but find clear differences between passive fractions of centrals and satellites. We also find that our passive fractions increase with both halo-to-satellite mass ratio and central-to-second rank mass ratio. This suggests that quenching is more efficient in satellites that are low-mass for their halo ($i.e$ at high halo-to-satellite mass ratio in comparison to low halo-to-satellite mass ratio) and are more likely to be passive in older groups - forming a consistent picture of environmental quenching of satellites. We then discuss potential explanations for the previously observed similarity, such as dependence on the group-finding method.},

We can constrain the SFH with high level of precision from galaxies with resolved stellar populations, since we are able to discriminate between stars of different ages from the spectrum they emit. However, the relative importance of secular evolution (nature) over nurture is not yet clear, and separating the effects of interaction-driven evolution in the observed galaxy properties is not trivial. The aim of this study is to use MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO) Integral Field Unit (IFU) data, in combination with multi-wavelength data, to constrain the SFH of nearby isolated galaxies. We present here the new techniques we are developing to constrain the SFH with high level of precision from Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting.

abstract = {The question of whether galaxy mergers are linked to the triggering of active galactic nuclei (AGN) continues to be a topic of considerable debate. The issue can be broken down into two distinct questions: (1) Can galaxy mergers trigger AGN? (2) Are galaxy mergers the dominant AGN triggering mechanism? A complete picture of the AGN-merger connection requires that both of these questions are addressed with the same data set. In previous work, we have shown that galaxy mergers selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) show an excess of both optically selected, and mid-IR colour-selected AGN, demonstrating that the answer to the first of the above questions is affirmative. Here, we use the same optical and mid-IR AGN selection to address the second question, by quantifying the frequency of morphological disturbances in low-surface brightness r-band images from the Canada France Imaging Survey (CFIS). Only $\sim$30 per cent of optical AGN host galaxies are morphologically disturbed, indicating that recent interactions are not the dominant trigger. However, almost 60 per cent of mid-IR AGN hosts show signs of visual disturbance, indicating that interactions play a more significant role in nuclear feeding. Both mid-IR and optically selected AGN have interacting fractions that are a factor of two greater than a mass and redshift matched non-AGN control sample, an excess that increases with both AGN luminosity and host galaxy stellar mass.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate environment driven gas depletion in satellite galaxies, taking full advantage of the atomic hydrogen (HI) spectral stacking technique to quantify the gas content for the entire gas-poor to -rich regime. We do so using a multi-wavelength sample of 10,600 satellite galaxies, selected according to stellar mass (log M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$ $\geq$ 9) and redshift (0.02 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.05) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with HI data from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. Using key HI-to-stellar mass scaling relations, we present evidence that the gas content of satellite galaxies is, to a significant extent, dependent on the environment in which a galaxy resides. For the first time, we demonstrate that systematic environmental suppression of gas content at both fixed stellar mass and fixed specific star formation rate (sSFR) in satellite galaxies begins in halo masses typical of the group regime (log M$_{h}$/M$_{\odot}$ < 13.5), well before galaxies reach the cluster environment. We also show that environment driven gas depletion is more closely associated to halo mass than local density. Our results are then compared with state-of-the-art semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations and discussed within this framework, showing that more work is needed if models are to reproduce the observations. We conclude that the observed decrease of gas content in the group and cluster environments cannot be reproduced by starvation of the gas supply alone and invoke fast acting processes such as ram-pressure stripping of cold gas to explain this.},

abstract = {In two-dimensional spectrographs, the optical distortions in the spatial and dispersion directions produce variations in the sub-pixel sampling of the background spectrum. Using knowledge of the camera distortions and the curvature of the spectral features, one can recover information regarding the background spectrum on wavelength scales much smaller than a pixel. As a result, one can propagate this better-sampled background spectrum through inverses of the distortion and rectification transformations, and accurately model the background spectrum in two-dimensional spectra for which the distortions have not been removed (i.e. the data have not been rebinned/rectified). The procedure, as outlined in this paper, is extremely insensitive to cosmic rays, hot pixels, etc. Because of this insensitivity to discrepant pixels, sky modeling and subtraction need not be performed as one of the later steps in a reduction pipeline. Sky-subtraction can now be performed as one of the earliest tasks, perhaps just after dividing by a flat-field. Because subtraction of the background can be performed without having to ``clean'' cosmic rays, such bad pixel values can be trivially identified after removal of the two-dimensional sky background.},

abstract = {Using the publicly available vespa data base of SDSS Data Release 7 spectra, we calculate the stellar mass weighted age (hereafter MWA) as a function of local galaxy density and dark matter halo mass. We compare our results with semi-analytic models from the public Millennium Simulation. We find that the stellar MWA has a large scatter which is inherent in the data and consistent with that seen in semi-analytic models. The stellar MWA is consistent with being independent (to first order) with local galaxy density, which is also seen in semi-analytic models. By splitting the sample into bins of total stellar mass, we find a strong dependence, with stellar MWA increasing for more massive galaxies. As a function of increasing dark matter halo mass (using the SDSS New York Value Added Group catalogues), we find that the average stellar MWA for member galaxies increases, which is again found in semi-analytic models. We again split the sample into bins of total stellar mass, and still find a strong dependence on stellar MWA for increasing mass galaxies, but additionally a second order trend of increasing stellar MWA with increasing dark matter mass of the host halo. Furthermore we use public dark matter mass accretion history (MAH) code calibrated on simulations, to calculate the dark matter MWA as a function of dark matter halo mass. In agreement with earlier analyses, we find that the stellar MWA and the dark matter MWA are anticorrelated for large mass haloes, i.e, dark matter accretion does not seem to be the primary factor in determining when stellar mass was assembled. This effect can be described by downsizing. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {We examine the connection between the properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the quenching and morphological evolution of central galaxies in the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG simulations. The simulations yield very different median CGM mass fractions, fCGM, as a function of halo mass, M200, with low-mass haloes being significantly more gas-rich in IllustrisTNG than in EAGLE. Nonetheless, in both cases scatter in fCGM at fixed M200 is strongly correlated with the specific star formation rate and the kinematic morphology of central galaxies. The correlations are strongest for ∼L∗galaxies, corresponding to the mass scale atwhichAGNfeedback becomes efficient. This feedback elevates theCGMcooling time, preventing gas from accreting on to the galaxy to fuel star formation, and thus establishing a preference for quenched, spheroidal galaxies to be hosted by haloes with low fCGM for their mass. In both simulations, fCGM correlates negatively with the host halo's intrinsic concentration, and hence with its binding energy and formation redshift, primarily because early halo formation fosters the rapid early growth of the central black hole (BH). This leads to a lower fCGM at fixed M200 in EAGLE because the BH reaches high accretion rates sooner, whilst in IllustrisTNG it occurs because the central BH reaches the mass threshold at which AGN feedback is assumed to switch from thermal to kinetic injection earlier. Despite these differences, there is consensus from these state-of-the-art simulations that the expulsion of efficiently cooling gas from the CGM is a crucial step in the quenching and morphological evolution of central galaxies.},

We find that the rotation velocity-stellar mass relationship (the inverse of the Tully- Fisher relationship) for our rotationally dominated sources (vC/$\sigma$ 0 > 1) has a consistent slope and normalization as that observed for z = 0 discs. In contrast, the specific angular momentum (j* angular momentum divided by stellar mass) is ≈0.2-0.3 dex lower on average compared to z = 0 discs. The specific angular momentum scales as js ∝ M*0.6±0.2, consistent with that expected for dark matter (i.e. jDM ∝ MDM2/3). We find that z≈ 0.9 star-forming galaxies have decreasing specific angular momentum with increasing S{\'{e}}rsic index. Visually, the sources with the highest specific angular momentum, for a given mass, have the most disc-dominated morphologies. This implies that an angular momentum-mass-morphology relationship, similar to that observed in local massive galaxies, is already in place by z ≈ 1.},

abstract = {This paper presents an environment and stellar mass study of a large sample of star-forming H$\alpha$ emitters at z= 0.84 from the High-z Emission Line Survey (HiZELS), over 1.3 deg2 split over two fields (COSMOS and UKIDSS UDS). By taking advantage of a truly panoramic coverage of a wide range of environments, from the field to a rich cluster, it is shown that both stellar mass and environment play crucial roles in determining the properties of star-forming galaxies. Specific star formation rates (sSFRs) decline with stellar mass in all environments, and the fraction of H$\alpha$ star-forming galaxies declines sharply from ≈40 per cent for galaxies with masses around 1010M⊙ to effectively zero above 1011.5M⊙, confirming that mass-downsizing is generally in place by z∼ 1. The fraction of star-forming galaxies is also found to fall sharply as a function of local environmental density from ≈40 per cent in the field to approaching zero at rich group/cluster densities. When star formation does occur in such high density regions, it is found to be mostly dominated by potential mergers and, indeed, if only non-merging star-forming galaxies are considered, then the environment and mass trends are even stronger and are qualitatively similar at all masses and environments, respectively, as in the local Universe. The median SFR of H$\alpha$ emitters at z= 0.84 is found to increase with density for both field and intermediate (group or cluster outskirts) densities; this is clearly seen as a change in the faint-end slope of the H$\alpha$ luminosity function from steep ($\alpha$≈-1.9), in poor fields, to shallow ($\alpha$≈-1.1) in groups and clusters. Interestingly, the relation between median SFR and environment is only found for low- to moderate-mass galaxies (with stellar masses below about 1010.6M⊙), and is not seen for the most massive star-forming galaxies. Overall, these observations provide a detailed view over a sufficiently large range of mass and environment to reconcile previous observational claims: stellar mass is the primary predictor of star formation activity at z∼ 1, but the environment, while initially enhancing the median SFR of (lower mass) star-forming galaxies, is ultimately responsible for suppressing star formation activity in all galaxies above surface densities of 10-30 Mpc-2 (group and cluster environments). {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

We perform bulge-to-disc decomposition of the surface brightness profiles and find ∼41  ±  3% of > 1010  M⊙ galaxies to be best fitted with two components. We complement our analysis with non-parametric morphological measurements and qualitative visual classifications. We find that both galaxy structure and morphology depend on stellar mass and environment for our sample as a whole. We only find an impact of the environment on galaxy size for galaxies more massive than 1011  M⊙ . We find higher S{\'{e}}rsic indices (n) and bulge-to-total ratios (B/T) in high-density regions when compared to low-density counterparts at similar stellar masses. We also find that galaxies with higher stellar mass have steeper light profiles (high n, B/T) compared to galaxies with lower stellar mass. Using visual classifications, we find a morphology-density relation at z  ∼  0.84 for galaxies more massive than 1010  M⊙ , with elliptical galaxies being dominant at high-density regions and disc galaxies more common in low-density regions. However, when splitting the sample into colour-colour-selected star-forming and quiescent sub-populations, there are no statistically significant differences between low- and high-density regions. We find that quiescent galaxies are smaller, have higher S{\'{e}}rsic indices (for single profiles, around n  ∼  4), and higher bulge-to-total light ratios (for decomposed profiles, around B/T  ∼  0.5) when compared to star-forming counterparts (n  ∼  1 and B/T  ∼  0.3, for single and double profiles, respectively). We confirm these trends with non-parametric quantities, finding quiescent galaxies to be smoother (lower asymmetry, lower M20) and to have most of their light over smaller areas (higher concentration and Gini coefficient) than star-forming galaxies. Overall, we find a stronger dependence of structure and morphology on stellar mass than on local density and these relations are strongly correlated with the quenching fraction. The change in average structure or morphology corresponds to a change in the relative fractions of blue disc-like galaxies and red elliptical galaxies with stellar mass and environment. We hypothesise that the processes responsible for the quenching of star formation must also affect the galaxy morphology on similar timescales.},

We have developed and applied a code for kinematic substructure detection to a sample of 412 galaxy clusters drawn from the \citet[]{tempel2012} catalogue, finding a frequency of substructures of 45\%. We have extracted mean stellar ages with the {\sc{starlight}} spectral synthesis code applied to SDSS-III spectra of the sample galaxies. We found lower mean stellar ages in unrelaxed clusters relative to relaxed clusters. For unrelaxed clusters, we separated primary and secondary subhalos and found that, while relaxed clusters and primaries present similar masses and age distributions, secondaries present younger stellar populations, mainly due to low-mass galaxies ($\log M_\star/M_\odot \lesssim 11$\,dex). An age-clustercentric radius relation is seen for all subhalos irrespective of the presence of substructures. We also observe relations between the mean stellar age and mass of relaxed and unrelaxed clusters, massive systems presenting higher mean ages. The locus of these relations is distinct between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters, but become indistinguishable when separating primaries and secondaries. Our results suggest that differences between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters are mainly driven by low-mass systems in the clusters outskirts, and that, while pre-processing can be seen in the subcomponents of dynamically young clusters, some evolution in the stellar populations must occur during the clusters relaxation.},

abstract = {The co-evolution between supermassive black holes and their environment is most directly traced by the hot atmospheres of dark matter halos. The cooling of the hot atmosphere supplies the central regions with fresh gas, igniting active galactic nuclei (AGN) with long duty cycles. Outflows from the central engine tightly couple with the surrounding gaseous medium and provide the dominant heating source preventing runaway cooling by carving cavities and driving shocks across the medium. The AGN feedback loop is a key feature of all modern galaxy evolution models. Here, we review our knowledge of the AGN feedback process in the specific context of galaxy groups. Galaxy groups are uniquely suited to constrain the mechanisms governing the cooling-heating balance. Unlike in more massive halos, the energy that is supplied by the central AGN to the hot intragroup medium can exceed the gravitational binding energy of halo gas particles. We report on the state-of-the-art in observations of the feedback phenomenon and in theoretical models of the heating-cooling balance in galaxy groups. We also describe how our knowledge of the AGN feedback process impacts galaxy evolution models and large-scale baryon distributions. Finally, we discuss how new instrumentation will answer key open questions on the topic.},

abstract = {We explore the radial distribution of star formation in galaxies in the SAMI Galaxy Survey as a function of their Local Group environment. Using a sample of galaxies in groups (with halo masses less than ≃ 1014M⊙) from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey, we find signatures of environmental quenching in high-mass groups (MG ≥ 1012.5M⊙). The mean integrated specific star formation rate (sSFR) of star-forming galaxies in high-mass groups is lower than for galaxies in low-mass groups or those that are ungrouped, with $\Delta$log(sSFR/yr-1) = 0.45 ± 0.07. This difference is seen at all galaxy stellar masses. In high-mass groups, starforming galaxies more massive than M∗ ∼ 1010M⊙ have centrally concentrated star formation. These galaxies also lie below the star formation main sequence, which suggests they may be undergoing outside-in quenching. Lower mass galaxies in high-mass groups do not show evidence of concentrated star formation. In groups less massive than MG = 1012.5M⊙, we do not observe these trends. In this regime, we find a modest correlation between centrally concentrated star formation and an enhancement in the total star formation rate, consistent with triggered star formation in these galaxies.},

abstract = {Cluster star-forming galaxies are found to have an excess of far-infrared emission relative to H$\alpha$, when compared to those in the field, which could be caused by intense active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, dust and/or declining star formation histories. Here we present spectroscopic observations of H$\alpha$ emitters in the Cl 0939+4713 (Abell 851) super-cluster at z = 0.41, using AF2+ WYFFOS on the William Herschel Telescope. We measure [O II], H$\beta$, [O III], H$\alpha$ and [N II] for a sample of 119 H$\alpha$ emitters in and around the cluster. We find that 17 ± 5 per cent of the H$\alpha$ emitters are AGN, irrespective of environment. For star-forming galaxies, we obtain Balmer decrements, metallicities and ionization parameters with different methods, individually and by stacking. We find a strong mass-metallicity relation at all environments, with no significant dependence on environment. The ionization parameter declines with increasing stellar mass for low-mass galaxies. H$\alpha$ emitters residing in intermediate environments show the highest ionization parameters (along with high [O III]/H$\alpha$ and high [O III]/[O II] line ratios, typically twice as large as in the highest and lowest densities), which decline with increasing environmental density. Dust extinction (AH$\alpha$) correlates strongly with stellar mass, but also with environmental density. Star-forming galaxies in the densest environments are found to be significantly dustier (AH$\alpha$ ≈ 1.5 - 1.6) than those residing in the lowest density environments (AH$\alpha$ ≈ 0.6), deviating significantly from what would be predicted given their stellar masses.},

abstract = {Radiation, winds and jets from the active nucleus of a massive galaxy can interact with its interstellar medium leading to ejection or heating of the gas. This can terminate star formation in the galaxy and stifle accretion onto the black hole. Such Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback can account for the observed proportionality between central black hole and host galaxy mass. Direct observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback, which occurs when the AGN is very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is accumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio mode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when the AGN is operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical galaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the central galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot surrounding medium. The energy flow, which is roughly continuous, heats the hot intracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by an order of magnitude. Feedback appears to maintain a long-lived heating/cooling balance. Powerful, jetted radio outbursts may represent a further mode of energy feedback which affect the cores of groups and subclusters. New telescopes and instruments from the radio to X-ray bands will come into operation over the next few years and lead to a rapid expansion in observational data on all modes of AGN feedback.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate how massive central galaxies cease their star formation by comparing theoretical predictions from cosmological simulations: EAGLE, Illustris and IllustrisTNG with observations of the local Universe from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our machine learning (ML) classification reveals supermassive black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) as the most predictive parameter in determining whether a galaxy is star forming or quenched at redshift $z=0$ in all three simulations. This predicted consequence of active galactic nucleus (AGN) quenching is reflected in the observations, where it is true for a range of indirect estimates of $M_{\rm BH}$ via proxies as well as its dynamical measurements. Our partial correlation analysis shows that other galactic parameters lose their strong association with quiescence, once their correlations with $M_{\rm BH}$ are accounted for. In simulations we demonstrate that it is the integrated power output of the AGN, rather than its instantaneous activity, which causes galaxies to quench. Finally, we analyse the change in molecular gas content of galaxies from star forming to passive populations. We find that both gas fractions ($f_{\rm gas}$) and star formation efficiencies (SFEs) decrease upon transition to quiescence in the observations but SFE is more predictive than $f_{\rm gas}$ in the ML passive/star-forming classification. These trends in the SDSS are most closely recovered in IllustrisTNG and are in direct contrast with the predictions made by Illustris. We conclude that a viable AGN feedback prescription can be achieved by a combination of preventative feedback and turbulence injection which together quench star formation in central galaxies.},

abstract = {The metallicity and its relationship with other galactic properties is a fundamental probe of the evolution of galaxies. In this work, we select about 750,000 star-forming spatial pixels from 1122 blue galaxies in the MaNGA survey to investigate the global stellar mass - local stellar mass surface density - gas-phase metallicity ($M_*$ - $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ ) relation. At a fixed $M_*$, the metallicity increases steeply with increasing $\Sigma_*$. Similarly, at a fixed $\Sigma_*$, the metallicity increases strongly with increasing $M_*$ at low mass end, while this trend becomes less obvious at high mass end. We find the metallicity to be more strongly correlated to $\Sigma_*$ than to $M_*$. Furthermore, we construct a tight (0.07 dex scatter) $M_*$ - $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ relation, which reduces the scatter in the $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ relation by about 30$\%$ for galaxies with $7.8 < {\rm log}(M_*/M_\odot) < 11.0$, while the reduction of scatter is much weaker for high-mass galaxies. This result suggests that, especially for low-mass galaxies, the $M_*$ - $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ relation is largely more fundamental than the $M_*$ - $Z$ and $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ relations, meaning that both $M_*$ and $\Sigma_*$ play important roles in shaping the local metallicity. We also find that the local metallicity is probably independent on the local star formation rate surface density at a fixed $M_*$ and $\Sigma_*$. Our results are consistent with the scenario that the local metallicities in galaxies are shaped by the combination of the local stars formed in the history and the metal loss caused by galactic winds.},

abstract = {We present a new model to compute the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized prescription of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of HII regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the HII regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding HI regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of a homogeneous sample of nearby UV-selected starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-IR to UV luminosities, the ratio of Halpha to Hbeta luminosities, the Halpha equivalent width, and the UV spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient to resolve an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to lambda^-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-IR to UV luminosities and the UV spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. Our model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model. (abridged)},

abstract = {Aims. We present a new analysis of the rest-frame B-band COMBO-17 and DEEP2 luminosity functions (LFs) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) as a function of luminosity and mass. Our aim is to place new stringent constraints on the evolution of ETGs since z ∼ 1. Methods. We correct the LF(z) data for the luminosity dimming assuming pure luminosity evolution. However, instead of relying on stellar population synthesis model-dependent assumptions, we adopt the empirical luminosity dimming rate derived from the evolution of the Fundamental Plane of field and cluster massive ETGs. Results. Our results show that the amount of evolution for the ETG population depends critically on the range of luminosity and masses considered. While the number density of luminous (massive) ETGs with MB(z = 0) < -20.5 (M > 1011 M⊙) is nearly constant since z ∼ 0.8, less luminous galaxies display a deficit which grows with redshift and that can be explained with a gradual population of the ETG "red sequence" by the progressive quenching of star formation in galaxies less massive than ∼1011 Ṁ. At each redshift there is a critical mass above which virtually all ETGs appear to be in place, and this fits well in the now popular "downsizing" scenario. However, "downsizing" does not appear to be limited to star formation, but the concept may have to be extended to the mass assembly itself as the build-up of the most massive galaxies preceeds that of the less massive ones. This evolutionary trend is not reproduced by the most recent theoretical simulations even when they successfully reproduce "downsizing" in star formation. {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe STECMAP (STEllar Content via Maximum A Posteriori), a flexible, non-parametric inversion method for the interpretation of the integrated light spectra of galaxies, based on synthetic spectra of single stellar populations (SSPs). We focus on the recovery of a galaxy's star formation history and stellar age-metallicity relation. We use the high-resolution SSPs produced by p{\'{e}}gase-hr to quantify the informational content of the wavelength range $\lambda$$\lambda$= 4000-6800. Regularization of the inversion is achieved by requiring that the solutions are relatively smooth functions of age. The smoothness parameter is set automatically via generalized cross validation. A detailed investigation of the properties of the corresponding simplified linear problem is performed using singular value decomposition. It turns out to be a powerful tool for explaining and predicting the behaviour of the inversion, and may help designing SSP models in the future. We provide means of quantifying the fundamental limitations of the problem considering the intrinsic properties of the SSPs in the spectral range of interest, as well as the noise in these models and in the data. We demonstrate that the information relative to the stellar content is relatively evenly distributed within the optical spectrum. We show that one should not attempt to recover more than about eight characteristic episodes in the star formation history from the wavelength domain we consider. STECMAP preserves optimal (in the cross validation sense) freedom in the characterization of these episodes for each spectrum. We performed a systematic simulation campaign and found that, when the time elapsed between two bursts of star formation is larger than 0.8 dex, the properties of each episode can be constrained with a precision of 0.02 dex in age and 0.04 dex in metallicity from high-quality data [R= 10 000, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) = 100 per pixel], not taking model errors into account. We also found that the spectral resolution has little effect on population separation provided low- and high-resolution experiments are performed with the same SNR per {\AA}. However, higher spectral resolution does improve the accuracy of metallicity and age estimates in double-burst separation experiments. When the fluxes of the data are properly calibrated, extinction can be estimated; otherwise the continuum can be discarded or used to estimate flux correction factors. The described methods and error estimates will be useful in the design and in the analysis of extragalactic spectroscopic surveys. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

We used the Keck/Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph and the William Herschel Telescope/AutoFib2+WYFFOS to confirm 83 H$\alpha$ emitters in and around the merging cluster. We find that cluster star-forming galaxies in the hottest X-ray gas and/or in the cluster subcores (away from the shock fronts) show high [S II]6716/[S II]6761 and high [S II] 6716/H$\alpha$, implying very low electron densities (<30 × lower than all other star-forming galaxies outside the cluster) and/or significant contribution from supernovae, respectively. All cluster star-forming galaxies near the cluster centre show evidence of significant outflows (blueshifted Na D $\sim$200-300 km s-1), likely driven by supernovae. Strong outflows are also found for the cluster H$\alpha$ active galactic nucleus (AGN). H$\alpha$ star-forming galaxies in the merging cluster follow the z $\sim$ 0 mass-metallicity relation, showing systematically higher metallicity ($\sim$0.15-0.2 dex) than H$\alpha$ emitters outside the cluster (projected R > 2.5 Mpc). This suggests that the shock front may have triggered remaining metal-rich gas which galaxies were able to retain into forming stars. Our observations show that the merger of impressively massive ($\sim$1015 M⊙) clusters can provide the conditions for significant star formation and AGN activity, but, as we witness strong feedback by star-forming galaxies and AGN (and given how massive the merging cluster is), such sources will likely quench in a few 100 Myr.},

Five rebrightenings were observed after the main superoutburst. The spectra during the post- superoutburst stage showed the Balmer, He I and possible sodium doublet features. The mass ratio is derived as 0.0880(9) from the period of the superhump. During the third and fifth re- brightenings, growing superhumps and superoutbursts were observed, which have never been detected during a rebrightening phase among WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebright- enings. To induce a superoutburst during the brightening phase, the accretion disk was needed to expand beyond the 3:1 resonance radius of the system again after the main superoutburst.These peculiar phenomena can be explained by the enhanced viscosity and large radius of the disk suggested by the higher luminosity and the presence of late-stage superhumps during the post-superoutburst stage, plus by more mass supply from the cool mass reservoir and/or from the secondary because of the enhanced mass transfer than those of other WZ Sge-type dwarf novae.},

abstract = {We have constructed merger trees for galaxies in the Illustris simulation by directly tracking the baryonic content of subhaloes. These merger trees are used to calculate the galaxy-galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellar mass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. We demonstrate that the most appropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy-galaxy merger consists in taking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reaches its maximum stellar mass. Additionally, we avoid effects from 'orphaned' galaxies by allowing some objects to 'skip' a snapshot when finding a descendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined 'infall' moment. Adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which are qualitatively similar to the halo-halo merger rate except for the last one: a strong correlation with redshift that evolves as {\$\sim${}}(1 + z)2.4-2.8, a power law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence on descendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellar masses greater than {\$\sim${}}2 × 1011M⊙. These trends are consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies (M* ≳ 1010M⊙), but in tension with some recent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies (M* ≳ 1011M⊙), which report a nearly constant or decreasing evolution with redshift. Finally, we provide a fitting function for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate which is accurate over a wide range of stellar masses, progenitor mass ratios, and redshifts.},

abstract = {The massive galaxy population above the characteristic Schechter mass M*{\$\sim${}}10{\^{}}10.6 Msun contributes to about half of the total stellar mass in the local Universe. These massive galaxies usually reside in hot dark matter haloes above the critical shock-heating mass {\$\sim${}}10{\^{}}12 Msun, where the external cold gas supply to these galaxies is expected to be suppressed. When galaxies run out of their cold gas reservoir, they become dead and quiescent. Therefore, massive quiescent galaxies living in hot haloes are commonly believed to be gas-poor. Based on the data from SDSS, ALFALFA, GASS and COLD GASS surveys, here we show that the vast majority of the massive, quiescent, central disk galaxies in the nearby Universe have a remarkably large amount of cold atomic hydrogen gas, surprisingly similar to star-forming galaxies. Both star-forming and quiescent disk galaxies show identical symmetric double-horn HI spectra, indicating similar regularly rotating HI disks. Relative to their star-forming counterparts, massive quiescent central disk galaxies are quenched because of their significantly reduced molecular gas content, lower dust content, and lower star formation efficiency. Our findings reveal a new picture, which clearly demonstrates the detailed star-formation quenching process in massive galaxies and provides a stringent constraint on the physical mechanism of quenching.},

abstract = {We investigate the nature of gas accretion onto haloes and galaxies at z=2 using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with the moving mesh code AREPO. Implementing a Monte Carlo tracer particle scheme to determine the origin and thermodynamic history of accreting gas, we make quantitative comparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3. Contrasting these two numerical approaches, we find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of accreted gas in haloes above 10^10.5 solar masses. In agreement with previous work, GADGET simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming in massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats to an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same galaxies in AREPO show a much lower cold fraction, <20% in haloes above 10^11 solar masses. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same halo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with GADGET, while the cold accretion rate is also lower. These discrepancies increase for more massive systems, and we explain both as due to numerical inaccuracies in the standard formulation of SPH. We also observe that the relatively sharp transition from cold to hot mode dominated accretion, at a halo mass of $\sim$10^11, is a consequence of comparing past gas temperatures to a constant threshold value independent of virial temperature. Examining the spatial distribution of accreting gas, we find that gas filaments in GADGET tend to remain collimated and flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large number of purely numerical "blobs". Similar gas streams in AREPO show increased heating and disruption at 0.25-0.5 virial radii and contribute to the hot gas accretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.},

We measure the effective radius of the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) emission for 62 massive SFGs. They are distributed over wide ranges of FIR size from Re,FIR =0.4 kpc to Re,FIR =6 kpc. The effective radius of the FIR emission is smaller by a factor of 2.3+1−190 than the effective radius of the optical emission and by a factor of 1.9+1−190 smaller than the half-mass radius. Even with taking into account potential extended components, the FIR size would change by ∼10%. By combining the spatial distributions of the FIR and optical emission, we investigate how galaxies change the effective radius of the optical emission and the stellar mass within a radius of 1 kpc, M1kpc. The compact starburst puts most of massive SFGs on the mass–size relation for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z ∼ 2 within 300 Myr if the current star formation activity and its spatial distribution are maintained. We also find that within 300 Myr, ∼38% of massive SFGs can reach the central mass of M1kpc = 1010.5 M☉, which is around the boundary between massive SFGs and QGs. These results suggest an outside-in transformation scenario in which a dense core is formed at the center of a more extended disk, likely via dissipative in-disk inflows. Synchronized observations at ALMA 870 µm and JWST 3–4 µm will explicitly verify this scenario.},

We characterize the environment by: (1) ∑ 5, the surface number density of galaxies determined by the projected distance to the fifth nearest neighbour; and (2) $\rho$ 1.1 and $\rho$ 5.5, three-dimensional density estimates obtained by convolving the galaxy distribution with Gaussian kernels of dispersion 1.1 and 5.5 Mpc, respectively. We find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies form two distinct populations, as characterized by their H$\alpha$ equivalent width, W 0(H$\alpha$). The relative numbers of star-forming and quiescent galaxies vary strongly and continuously with local density. However, the distribution of W 0(H$\alpha$) amongst the star-forming population is independent of environment. The fraction of star-forming galaxies shows strong sensitivity to the density on large scales, $\rho$ 5.5, which is likely independent of the trend with local density, $\rho$ 1.1. We use two differently selected group catalogues to demonstrate that the correlation with galaxy density is approximately independent of group velocity dispersion, for $\sigma$ = 200-1000 km s -1. Even in the lowest-density environments, no more than ∼70 per cent of galaxies show significant H$\alpha$ emission. Based on these results, we conclude that the present-day correlation between star formation rate and environment is a result of short-time-scale mechanisms that take place preferentially at high redshift, such as starbursts induced by galaxy-galaxy interactions.},

We analyse the abundance ratios of magnesium and europium in Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG100 simulation (stellar masses log (M*/M⊙) $\sim$ 9.7-11.2). Comparison of observed magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way with the stellar abundances in our more than 850 Milky Way-like galaxies provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. Here, we use the magnesium-to-iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII (core-collapse supernovae) and SNIa (Type Ia supernovae) metal return prescription and as a comparison to a variety of galactic observations. The europium-to-iron ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star-neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site of europium production in our models, and is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in MilkyWay-like galaxies show no correlation with assembly history, present-day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar population age. We reproduce the europium-to-iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, and find it is sensitive to gas properties during redshifts z ≈ 2-4. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is quite robust.},

Both galaxies have log(${\cal M_{\star}}$/\msol)$>11$ and are gas rich, with ${\cal M}_{\rm mol}$/(${\cal M_{\star}}+{\cal M}_{\rm mol}$)$\sim 0.17-0.45$. One of these galaxies lies on the star formation rate (SFR)-${\cal M_{\star}}$ sequence while the other lies an order of magnitude below. We compare the cluster galaxies to other SFR-selected galaxies with CO measurements and find that they have CO luminosities consistent with expectations given their infrared luminosities. We also find that they have comparable gas fractions and star formation efficiencies (SFE) to what is expected from published field galaxy scaling relations. The galaxies are compact in their stellar light distribution, at the extreme end for all high redshift star-forming galaxies. However, their SFE is consistent with other field galaxies at comparable compactness. This is similar to two other sources selected in a blind CO survey of the HDF-N. Despite living in a highly quenched proto-cluster core, the molecular gas properties of these two galaxies, one of which may be in the processes of quenching, appear entirely consistent with field scaling relations between the molecular gas content, stellar mass, star formation rate, and redshift. We speculate that these cluster galaxies cannot have any further substantive gas accretion if they are to become members of the dominant passive population in $z<1$ clusters.},

The sample includes all Hubble types and contains SFRs ranging from 0.01 to 100 Msun/yr. We compare the Kennicutt [OII] and H-alpha SFR calibrations and show that there are two significant effects which produce disagreement between SFR[OII] and SFR(H-alpha): reddening and metallicity. Differences in the ionization state of the ISM do not contribute significantly to the observed difference between SFR([OII]) and SFR(H-alpha) for the NFGS galaxies with metallicities log(O/H)12>8.5. The Kennicutt [OII]-SFR relation assumes a typical reddening for nearby galaxies; in practice, the reddening differs significantly from sample to sample. We derive a new SFR([OII]) calibration which does not contain a reddening assumption. Our new SFR([OII]) calibration also provides an optional correction for metallicity. Our SFRs derived from [OII] agree with those derived from H-alpha to within 0.03-0.05 dex. We apply our SFR([OII]) calibration with metallicity correction to two samples: high-redshift 0.8<z<1.6 galaxies from the NICMOS H-alpha survey, and 0.5<z<1.1 galaxies from the Canada-France Redshift Survey. The SFR([OII]) and SFR(H-alpha) for these samples agree to within the scatter observed for the NFGS sample, indicating that our SFR([OII]) relation can be applied to both local and high-z galaxies. Finally, we apply our SFR([OII]) to estimates of the cosmic star formation history. After reddening and metallicity corrections, the star formation rate densities derived from [OII] and H-alpha agree to within 30%.},

abstract = {In the redshift interval of 2 < z < 3, the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) in star-forming galaxies are likely to be different from those in the local Universe because of lower gaseous metallicities, higher gas fractions, and higher star formation activities. In fact, observations suggest that higher electron densities, higher ionization parameters, and harder UV radiation fields are common. In this paper, based on the spectra of H $\alpha$-selected starforming galaxies at z = 2.5 taken with Multi-Object Spectrometer for InfraRed Exploration on Keck-1 telescope, we measure electron densities (ne) using the oxygen line ratio ([O II] $\lambda$$\lambda$3726,3729), and investigate the relationships between the electron density of ionized gas and other physical properties. As a result, we find that the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and the surface density of SFR ($\Sigma$SFR) are correlated with the electron density at z =2.5 for the first time. The $\Sigma$SFR-ne relation is likely to be linked to the star formation law in HII regions (where star formation activity is regulated by interstellar pressure). Moreover, we discuss the mode of star formation in those galaxies. The correlation between sSFR and $\Sigma$SFR suggests that highly star-forming galaxies (with high sSFR) tend to be characterized by higher surface densities of star formation ($\Sigma$SFR) and thus higher ne values as well.},

Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic "dark ages" to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z$\sim$1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than $\sim$1% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

abstract = {The inflow of cosmological gas on to haloes, while challenging to directly observe and quantify, plays a fundamental role in the baryon cycle of galaxies. Using the eagle suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we present a thorough exploration of the physical properties of gas accreting on to haloes - namely, its spatial characteristics, density, temperature, and metallicity. Classifying accretion as 'hot' or "cold' based on a temperature cut-off 105.5 K, we find that the covering fraction (fcov) of cold-mode accreting gas is significantly lower than the hot-mode, with z = 0 fcov values of ${\approx}50{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ and ${\approx}80{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$, respectively. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in eagle reduces inflow fcov values by ${\approx}10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$, with outflows decreasing the solid angle available for accretion flows. Classifying inflow by particle history, we find that gas on first-infall on to a halo is metal depleted by ≈2 dex compared to pre-processed gas, which we find to mimic the circum-galactic medium (CGM) in terms of metal content. We also show that high (low) halo-scale gas accretion rates are associated with metal-poor (rich) CGM in haloes below $10^{12}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, and that variation in halo-scale gas accretion rates may offer a physical explanation for the enhanced scatter in the star-forming main sequence at low (${\lesssim}10^{9}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) and high (${\gtrsim}10^{10}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) stellar masses. Our results highlight how gas inflow influences several halo- and galaxy-scale properties, and the need to combine kinematic and chemical data in order to confidently break the degeneracy between accreting and outgoing gas in CGM observations.},

abstract = {Star-forming galaxies can in principle be transformed into passive systems by a multitude of processes that quench star formation, such as the halting of gas accretion (starvation) or the rapid removal of gas in AGN-driven outflows. However, it remains unclear which processes are the most significant, primary drivers of the SF-passive bimodality. We address this key issue in galaxy evolution by studying the chemical properties of 80 000 local galaxies in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. In order to distinguish between different quenching mechanisms, we analyse the stellar metallicities of star-forming, green valley, and passive galaxies. We find that the significant difference in stellar metallicity between passive galaxies and their star-forming progenitors implies that for galaxies at all masses, quenching must have involved an extended phase of starvation. However, some form of gas ejection also has to be introduced into our models to best match the observed properties of local passive galaxies, indicating that, while starvation is likely to be the prerequisite for quenching, it is the combination of starvation and outflows that is responsible for quenching the majority of galaxies. Closed-box models indicate that the duration of the quenching phase is 2–3 Gyr, with an e-folding time of 2–4 Gyr, after which further star formation is prevented by an ejective/heating mode. Alternatively, leaky-box models find a longer duration for the quenching phase of 5–7 Gyr and an e-folding time of ∼1 Gyr, with outflows becoming increasingly important with decreasing stellar mass. Finally, our analysis of local green valley galaxies indicates that quenching is slower in the local Universe than at high redshift.},

abstract = {Recent observations of galaxies in a cluster at z=0.35 show that their integrated gas-phase metallicities increase with decreasing cluster-centric distance. To test if ram pressure stripping (RPS) is the underlying cause, we use a semi-analytic model to quantify the "observational bias" that RPS introduces into the aperture-based metallicity measurements. We take integral field spectroscopy of local galaxies, remove gas from their outer galactic disks via RPS, and then conduct mock slit observations of cluster galaxies at z=0.35. Our RPS model predicts a typical cluster-scale metallicity gradient of -0.03 dex/Mpc. By removing gas from the outer galactic disks, RPS introduces a mean metallicity enhancement of +0.02 dex at a fixed stellar mass. This gas removal and subsequent quenching of star formation preferentially removes low mass cluster galaxies from the observed star-forming population. As only the more massive star-forming galaxies survive to reach the cluster core, RPS produces a cluster-scale stellar mass gradient of -0.05 log(M_*/M_sun)/Mpc. This mass segregation drives the predicted cluster-scale metallicity gradient of -0.03 dex/Mpc. However, the effects of RPS alone can not explain the higher metallicities measured in cluster galaxies at z=0.35. We hypothesize that additional mechanisms including steep internal metallicity gradients and self-enrichment due to gas strangulation are needed to reproduce our observations at z=0.35.},

abstract = {We review the observed demographics and inferred evolution of supermassive black holes (BHs) found by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass and the velocity dispersion of the host-galaxy bulge. It and other correlations led to the belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. BHs are found in pure-disk galaxies, so classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary to grow BHs. But BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. And any correlations with disk-grown pseudobulges or halo dark matter are so weak as to imply no close coevolution. We suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. 1- Local, stochastic feeding of small BHs in mainly bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. 2- Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers grows giant BHs in short, quasar-like "AGN" events whose feedback does affect galaxies. This makes classical bulges and coreless-rotating ellipticals. 3- At the highest BH masses, maintenance-mode feedback into X-ray gas has the negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating ellipticals. They inherit coevolution magic from smaller progenitors. 4- Independent of any feedback physics, the averaging that results from successive mergers helps to engineer tight BH correlations.},

abstract = {Understanding the interaction between galaxies and their surroundings is central to building a coherent picture of galaxy evolution. Here we use GALEX imaging of a statistically representative sample of 23 galaxy groups at z=0.06 to explore how local and global group environment affect the UV properties and dust-corrected star formation rates of their member galaxies. The data provide star formation rates out to beyond 2R_200 in all groups, down to a completeness limit and limiting galaxy stellar mass of 0.06 M_sun/yr and 10^8 M_sun, respectively. At fixed galaxy stellar mass, we find that the fraction of star-forming group members is suppressed relative to the field out to an average radius of R $\sim$ 1.5 Mpc $\sim$ 2R_200, mirroring results for massive clusters. For the first time we also report a similar suppression of the specific star formation rate within such galaxies, on average by 40% relative to the field, thus directly revealing the impact of the group environment in quenching star formation within infalling galaxies. At fixed galaxy density and stellar mass, this suppression is stronger in more massive groups, implying that both local and global group environment play a role in quenching. The results favor an average quenching timescale of at least $\sim$2 Gyr and strongly suggest that a combination of tidal interactions and starvation is responsible. Despite their past and ongoing quenching, galaxy groups with more than four members still account for at least $\sim$25% of the total UV output in the nearby universe.},

abstract = {Galaxy groups and poor clusters are more common than rich clusters, and host the largest fraction of matter content in the Universe. Hence, their studies are key to understand the gravitational and thermal evolution of the bulk of the cosmic matter. Moreover, because of their shallower gravitational potential, galaxy groups are systems where non-gravitational processes (e.g., cooling, AGN feedback, star formation) are expected to have a higher impact on the distribution of baryons, and on the general physical properties, than in more massive objects, inducing systematic departures from the expected scaling relations. Despite their paramount importance from the astrophysical and cosmological point of view, the challenges in their detection have limited the studies of galaxy groups. Upcoming large surveys will change this picture, reassigning to galaxy groups their central role in studying the structure formation and evolution in the Universe, and in measuring the cosmic baryonic content. Here, we review the recent literature on various scaling relations between X-ray and optical properties of these systems, focusing on the observational measurements, and the progress in our understanding of the deviations from the self-similar expectations on groups' scales. We discuss some of the sources of these deviations, and how feedback from supernovae and/or AGNs impacts the general properties and the reconstructed scaling laws. Finally, we discuss future prospects in the study of galaxy groups.},

abstract = {We present the results of a series of numerical simulations aimed to study the evolution of a disc galaxy within the global tidal field of a group environment. Both the disc galaxy and the group are modelled as multicomponent, collisionless, N-body systems, composed of both dark matter and stars. In our simulations, the evolution of disc galaxies is followed after they are released from the group virial radius, and as their orbits sink towards the group centre, under the effect of dynamical friction. We explore a broad parameter space, covering several aspects of the galaxy-group interaction that are potentially relevant to galaxy evolution. Namely, prograde and retrograde orbits, orbital eccentricities, disc inclination, role of a central bulge in discs, internal disc kinematics and galaxy-to-group mass ratios. We find that significant disc transformations occur only after the mean density of the group, measured within the orbit of the galaxy, exceeds $\sim$0.3-1 times the central mean density of the galaxy. The morphological evolution of discs is found to be strongly dependent on the initial inclination of the disc with respect to its orbital plane, i.e. discs on face-on and retrograde orbits are shown to retain their disc structures and kinematics longer, in comparison to prograde discs. This suggests that after interacting with the global tidal field alone, a significant fraction of disc galaxies should be found in the central regions of groups. Prominent central bulges are not produced, and pre-existing bulges are not enhanced in discs after the interaction with the group. Assuming that most S0 are formed in group environments, this implies that prominent bulges should be formed mostly by young stars, created only after a galaxy has been accreted by a group. Finally, contrary to some current implementations of tidal stripping in semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution, we find that more massive galaxies suffer more tidal stripping. This is because dynamical friction brings them faster to the group centre, in comparison to their lower mass counterparts. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

In recent years, the quality and quantity of the available data have increased, and there have been corresponding efforts to increase the realism of the stellar population models used to interpret these observations. Describing the observed galaxy spectral energy distributions in detail now requires physical models with a large number of highly correlated parameters. These models do not fit easily on grids and necessitate a full exploration of the available parameter space. We present Prospector , a flexible code for inferring stellar population parameters from photometry and spectroscopy spanning UV through IR wavelengths. This code is based on forward modeling the data and Monte Carlo sampling the posterior parameter distribution, enabling complex models and exploration of moderate dimensional parameter spaces. We describe the key ingredients of the code and discuss the general philosophy driving the design of these ingredients. We demonstrate some capabilities of the code on several data sets, including mock and real data. },

abstract = {The timescales for galaxy quenching offer clues to its underlying physical drivers. We investigate central galaxy quenching timescales in the IllustrisTNG 100-1 simulation, their evolution over time, and the pre-quenching properties of galaxies that predict their quenching timescales. Defining quenching duration $\tau$q as the time between crossing sSFR thresholds, we find that $\sim 40\%$ of galaxies quench rapidly with $\tau$q <1 Gyr, but a substantial tail of galaxies can take up to 10 Gyr to quench. Furthermore, 29% of galaxies that left the star forming main sequence (SFMS) more than 2 Gyr ago never fully quench by z = 0. While the median $\tau$q is fairly constant with epoch, the rate of galaxies leaving the SFMS increases steadily over cosmic time, with the rate of slow quenchers being dominant around z ∼ 2 to 0.7. Compared to fast quenchers ($\tau$q <1 Gyr), slow-quenching galaxies ($\tau$q >1 Gyr) were more massive, had more massive black holes, had larger stellar radii and accreted gas with higher specific angular momentum (AM) prior to quenching. These properties evolve little by z = 0, except for the accreting gas AM for fast quenchers, which reaches the same high AM as the gas in slow quenchers. By z = 0, slow quenchers also have residual star formation in extended gas rings. Using the expected relationship between stellar age gradient and $\tau$q for inside-out quenching we find agreement with MaNGA IFU observations. Our results suggest the accreting gas AM and potential well depth determine the quenching timescale.},

This bimodal behavior is seen up to z{\$\sim${}}2. Due to a combination of measurement errors and passive evolution, the color-color diagram is not suitable to distinguish the galaxy bimodality at z{\textgreater}2 for this sample, but we show that MIPS 24um data suggest that a significant population of quiescent galaxies exists even at these higher redshifts. At z=1-2, the most luminous objects in the sample are divided roughly equally between star-forming and quiescent galaxies, while at lower redshifts most of the brightest galaxies are quiescent. Moreover, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts are clustered more strongly than those actively forming stars, indicating that galaxies with early-quenched star formation may occupy more massive host dark matter halos. This suggests that the end of star formation is associated with, and perhaps brought about by, a mechanism related to halo mass.},

Our high-z dataset comprises 16 clusters, 10 groups and another 250 galaxies in poorer groups and the field at z=0.4-0.8 from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey, plus another 9 massive clusters at similar redshifts. As a local comparison, we use samples of galaxy systems selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at 0.04< z < 0.08. At high-z most systems follow a broad anticorrelation between the fraction of star-forming galaxies and the system velocity dispersion. At face value, this suggests that at z=0.4-0.8 the mass of the system largely determines the proportion of galaxies with ongoing star formation. At these redshifts the strength of star formation (as measured by the [OII] equivalent width) in star-forming galaxies is also found to vary systematically with environment. Sloan clusters have much lower fractions of star-forming galaxies than clusters at z=0.4-0.8 and, in contrast with the distant clusters, show a plateau for velocity dispersions $ \ge 550 km s^-1$, where the fraction of galaxies with [OII] emission does not vary systematically with velocity dispersion. We quantify the evolution of the proportion of star-forming galaxies as a function of the system velocity dispersion and find it is strongest in intermediate-mass systems (sigma $\sim$ 500-600 km s^-1 at z=0). To understand the origin of the observed trends, we use the Press-Schechter formalism and the Millennium Simulation and show that galaxy star formation histories may be closely related to the growth history of clusters and groups.

Our study utilizes a sample of 10 800 spectroscopic galaxy pairs and 97 post-mergers selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with matches to multiwavelength data sets. The LERG fraction amongst interacting galaxies is a factor of 3.5 higher than that of a control sample matched in local galaxy density, redshift and stellar mass. However, the LERG excess in pairs does not depend on projected separation and remains elevated out to at least 500 h<sup>-1</sup> <inf>70</inf> kpc, suggesting that major mergers are not their main fuelling channel. In order to identify the primary fuelling mechanism of LERGs, we compile samples of control galaxies that are matched in various host galaxy and environmental properties. The LERG excess is reduced, but not completely removed, when halo mass or D<inf>4000</inf> are included in the matching parameters. However, when both M<inf>halo</inf> and D<inf>4000</inf> are matched, there is no LERG excess and the 1.4 GHz luminosities (which trace jet mechanical power) are consistent between the pairs and control. In contrast, the excess of optical and mid-IR selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy pairs is unchanged when the additional matching parameters are implemented. Our results suggest that whilst major interactions may trigger optically and mid-IR selected AGN, the gas which fuels the LERGs has two secular origins: one associated with the large-scale environment, such as accretion from the surrounding medium or minor mergers, plus an internal stellar mechanism, such as winds from evolved stars.},

Similarly, the massive population (log10(M⋆ /M⊙ ) > 11) shows an increase in H$\delta$ absorption strengths in intermediate-density environments (e.g. filaments). Galaxies with intermediate stellar mass (10.5  <   log10(M⋆ /M⊙ ) < 11) have similar H$\delta$ absorption profiles in all environments, but show an indication of enhanced [OII] emission in intermediate-density environments. This indicates that field galaxies with low stellar mass and filament galaxies with high stellar mass are more likely to have experienced a recent burst of star formation, while galaxies of the intermediate stellar-mass show an increase of star formation at filament-like densities. We also find that the median [OII] equivalent width (|EW[OII]|) decreases from 27  ±  2 {\AA} to 2.0+0.5-0.4 {\AA} and Dn4000 increases from 1.09  ±  0.01 to 1.56  ±  0.03 with increasing stellar mass (from ∼109.25 to ∼1011.35  M⊙ ). For the dependence on the environment, we find that at fixed stellar mass, |EW[OII]| is tentatively lower in environments with higher density. We find for Dn4000 that the increase with stellar mass is sharper in denser environments, which indicates that these environments may accelerate galaxy evolution. Moreover, we find higher Dn4000 values in denser environments at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that galaxies are on average older and/or more metal rich in these dense environments. This set of tracers depicts a scenario where the most massive galaxies have, on average, the lowest specific star formation rates and the oldest stellar populations (age ≳ 1 Gyr, showing a mass-downsizing effect). We also hypothesize that the observed increase in star formation (higher EW[OII]|, higher specific star formation rate) at intermediate densities may lead to quenching because we find that the quenched fraction increases sharply from the filament to cluster-like regions at similar stellar masses.},

abstract = {Using observations made with MOSFIRE on Keck I as part of the ZFIRE survey, we present the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation at 2.0 < z < 2.5. The sample was drawn from a stellar mass limited, Ks-band selected catalog from ZFOURGE over the CANDELS area in the COSMOS field. We model the shear of the Halpha emission line to derive rotational velocities at 2.2X the scale radius of an exponential disk (V2.2). We correct for the blurring effect of a two-dimensional PSF and the fact that the MOSFIRE PSF is better approximated by a Moffat than a Gaussian, which is more typically assumed for natural seeing. We find for the Tully-Fisher relation at 2.0 < z < 2.5 that logV2.2 =(2.18 +/- 0.051)+(0.193 +/- 0.108)(logM/Msun - 10) and infer an evolution of the zeropoint of Delta M/Msun = -0.25 +/- 0.16 dex or Delta M/Msun = -0.39 +/- 0.21 dex compared to z = 0 when adopting a fixed slope of 0.29 or 1/4.5, respectively. We also derive the alternative kinematic estimator S0.5, with a best-fit relation logS0.5 =(2.06 +/- 0.032)+(0.211 +/- 0.086)(logM/Msun - 10), and infer an evolution of Delta M/Msun= -0.45 +/- 0.13 dex compared to z < 1.2 if we adopt a fixed slope. We investigate and review various systematics, ranging from PSF effects, projection effects, systematics related to stellar mass derivation, selection biases and slope. We find that discrepancies between the various literature values are reduced when taking these into account. Our observations correspond well with the gradual evolution predicted by semi-analytic models.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the [NII]/Ha ratio as a probe of gas-phase oxygen abundance for a sample of 419 star-forming galaxies at z=0.6-2.7 from the KMOS3D near-IR multi-IFU survey. The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) is determined consistently with the same sample selection, metallicity tracer, and methodology over the wide redshift range probed by the survey. We find good agreement with long-slit surveys in the literature, except for the low-mass slope of the relation at z$\sim$2.3, where this sample is less biased than previous samples based on optical spectroscopic redshifts. In this regime we measure a steeper slope than some literature results. Excluding the AGN contribution from the MZR reduces sensitivity at the high mass end, but produces otherwise consistent results. There is no significant dependence of the [NII]/Ha ratio on SFR or environment at fixed redshift and stellar mass. The IFU data allow spatially resolved measurements of [NII]/Ha, from which we can infer abundance gradients for 180 galaxies, thus tripling the current sample in the literature. The observed gradients are on average flat, with only 15 gradients statistically offset from zero at >3sigma. We have modelled the effect of beam-smearing, assuming a smooth intrinsic radial gradient and known seeing, inclination and effective radius for each galaxy. Our seeing-limited observations can recover up to 70% of the intrinsic gradient for the largest, face-on disks, but only 30% for the smaller, more inclined galaxies. We do not find significant trends between observed or corrected gradients and any stellar population, dynamical or structural galaxy parameters, mostly in agreement with existing studies with much smaller sample sizes. In cosmological simulations, strong feedback is generally required to produce flat gradients at high redshift.},

abstract = {Combining resolved optical spectroscopy with panoramic HST imaging, we study the dynamical properties of spiral galaxies as a function of position across two intermediate-redshift clusters, and we compare the cluster population to field galaxies in the same redshift range. By modeling the observed rotation curves, we derive maximal rotation velocities for 40 cluster spirals and 37 field spirals, yielding one of the largest matched samples of cluster and field spirals at intermediate redshift. We construct the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation in both V and Ks bands, and find that the cluster Tully-Fisher relation exhibits significantly higher scatter than the field relation, in both V and Ks bands. Under the assumption that this increased scatter is due to an interaction with the cluster environment, we examine several dynamical quantities (dynamical mass, mass-to-light ratio, and central mass density) as a function of cluster environment. We find that the central mass densities of star-forming spirals exhibit a sharp break near the cluster virial radius, with spirals in the cluster outskirts exhibiting significantly lower densities. We argue that the lower density spirals in the cluster outskirts, combined with the high scatter in both Ks- and V-band TF relations, demonstrate that cluster spirals are kinematically disturbed by their environment, even as far as 2Rvir from the cluster center. We propose that such disturbances may be due to a combination of galaxy merging and harassment.},

abstract = {This book covers water waves, surf zone hydrodynamics, tides in oceans and estuaries, storm surges, estuarine mixing, basic sediment transport, coastal morphodynamics and coastal groundwater dynamics. It is an introductory treatment, suitable for a first course in coastal and estuarine processes for earth scientists or engineers. Yet, there are substantial amounts of new material that are included, such as the explicit, analytical treatment of transient, forced long waves. Inclusion of this material will in turn strongly enhance the introductory treatment of tsunami, storm surges and surf beat. The treatment of sine wave theory emphasizes expressions which are explicit in the water depth h (using koh instead of kh) so that they can easily be differentiated or integrated with respect to h. This is a major pedagogical advantage because of the enhanced transparency. The treatment of turbulent mixing includes finite mixing length effects which provide an explanation for differential diffusion of different sediment sizes in suspension. The effects of acceleration skewness and boundary layer streaming are also included in the basic sediment transport models. The inclusion of beach groundwater dynamics - including the mechanisms by which waves as well as tides drive groundwater motion - provides a link between the previously unconnected fields of coastal hydraulics and regional groundwater modeling. Serving as a good reference book, it is fully indexed and comprehensively cross referenced. Abundant references to more detailed texts are also provided.},

We find: lower HI and H$_2$ mass fractions and higher star-formation efficiencies (SFEs) from HI and H$_2$ in the Virgo galaxies than the field galaxies for matched stellar masses; the Virgo galaxies generally follow the field relationships between the offset from the main sequence of the star-forming galaxies [$\Delta$(MS)] with gas fractions and SFEs but slightly offset to lower gas fractions or higher SFEs than field galaxies at $\Delta({\rm MS})\lesssim 0$; lower gas fractions in galaxies with smaller clustocentric distance and velocity; lower gas fractions in the galaxies in the W cloud, a substructure of the Virgo cluster. Our results suggest the cold-gas properties of some Virgo galaxies are affected by their environment at least at $3 R_{200}$ maybe via strangulation and/or pre-processes and HI and H$_2$ in some galaxies are removed by ram pressure at $<1.5 R_{200}$. Our data cannot rule the possibility of the other processes such as strangulation and galaxy harassment accounting for the gas reduction in some galaxies at $<1.5 R_{200}$.

abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z ∼ 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z ∼ 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30%-70% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate.We show that the observed constancy of the SchechterM* and $\alpha$s for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M* must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a valueM* that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by $\Delta$$\alpha$s ∼ 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and $\alpha$s as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M* and making $\alpha$s slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation ofstar formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative $\alpha$-element abundances. {\textcopyright} 2010.

For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 10^10(10^10.8) Msun at z<0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFR) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 micron photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct "main sequence (MS)", with a limited range of SFR at a given M* and z (1 sigma < +-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to log(M*). The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z>1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF, and the effect of mergers on SFR. Typical galaxies spend $\sim$67(95)% of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of <$\sim$ 2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z$\sim$1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFR are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z$\sim$1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs star formation prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

Our sample consists of cluster and field galaxies from $2.0 < z < 2.5$ with K band multi-object slit spectroscopic measurements of their H$\alpha$ emission lines. H$\alpha$ rotational velocities and gas velocity dispersions are measured using the Heidelberg Emission Line Algorithm (HELA), which compares directly to simulated 3D data-cubes. Using a suite of simulated emission lines, we determine that HELA reliably recovers input S$_{0.5}$ and angular momentum at small offsets, but $V_{2.2}/\sigma_g$ values are offset and highly scattered. We examine the role of regular and irregular morphology in the stellar mass kinematic scaling relations, deriving the kinematic measurement S$_{0.5}$, and finding $\log(S_{0.5}) = (0.38\pm0.07)\log(M/M_{\odot}-10) + (2.04\pm0.03)$ with no significant offset between morphological populations and similar levels of scatter ($\sim0.16$ dex). Additionally, we identify a correlation between M$_{\star}$ and $V_{2.2}/\sigma_g$ for the total sample, showing an increasing level of rotation dominance with increasing M$_{\star}$, and a high level of scatter for both regular and irregular galaxies. We estimate the specific angular momenta ($j_{disk}$) of these galaxies and find a slope of $0.36\pm0.12$, shallower than predicted without mass-dependent disk growth, but this result is possibly due to measurement uncertainty at M$_{\star}$ $<$ 9.5. However, through a K-S test we find irregular galaxies to have marginally higher $j_{disk}$ values than regular galaxies, and high scatter at low masses in both populations.},

abstract = {We present ALMA CO (2-1) detections in 11 gas-rich cluster galaxies at z$\sim$1.6, constituting the largest sample of molecular gas measurements in z>1.5 clusters to date. The observations span three galaxy clusters, derived from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-sequence Cluster Survey. We augment the >5sigma detections of the CO (2-1) fluxes with multi-band photometry, yielding stellar masses and infrared-derived star formation rates, to place some of the first constraints on molecular gas properties in z$\sim$1.6 cluster environments. We measure sizable gas reservoirs of 0.5-2x10^11 solar masses in these objects, with high gas fractions and long depletion timescales, averaging 62% and 1.4 Gyr, respectively. We compare our cluster galaxies to the scaling relations of the coeval field, in the context of how gas fractions and depletion timescales vary with respect to the star-forming main sequence. We find that our cluster galaxies lie systematically off the field scaling relations at z=1.6 toward enhanced gas fractions, at a level of $\sim$4sigma, but have consistent depletion timescales. Exploiting CO detections in lower-redshift clusters from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the gas fraction in cluster galaxies, finding it to mimic the strong rise with redshift in the field. We emphasize the utility of detecting abundant gas-rich galaxies in high-redshift clusters, deeming them as crucial laboratories for future statistical studies.},

abstract = {We present results from Subaru/FMOS near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of 118 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ in the Subaru Deep Field. These galaxies are selected as [OII]$\lambda$3727 emitters at $z\approx$ 1.47 and 1.62 from narrow-band imaging. We detect H$\alpha$ emission line in 115 galaxies, [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission line in 45 galaxies, and H$\beta$, [NII]$\lambda$6584, and [SII]$\lambda\lambda$6716,6731 in 13, 16, and 6 galaxies, respectively. Including the [OII] emission line, we use the six strong nebular emission lines in the individual and composite rest-frame optical spectra to investigate physical conditions of the interstellar medium in star-forming galaxies at $z\sim$1.5. We find a tight correlation between H$\alpha$ and [OII], which suggests that [OII] can be a good star formation rate (SFR) indicator for galaxies at $z\sim1.5$. The line ratios of H$\alpha$/[OII] are consistent with those of local galaxies. We also find that [OII] emitters have strong [OIII] emission lines. The [OIII]/[OII] ratios are larger than normal star-forming galaxies in the local Universe, suggesting a higher ionization parameter. Less massive galaxies have larger [OIII]/[OII] ratios. With evidence that the electron density is consistent with local galaxies, the high ionization of galaxies at high redshifts may be attributed to a harder radiation field by a young stellar population and/or an increase in the number of ionizing photons from each massive star.},

We select 1197 Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) groups at $0.05\leq z \leq 0.2$ and analyze the projected phase space (PPS) diagram, i.e. the galaxy velocity as a function of projected group-centric radius, as a local environmental metric in the low-mass halo regime $10^{12}\leq (M_{200}/M_{\odot})< 10^{14}$. We study the properties of star-forming group galaxies, exploring the correlation of star formation rate (SFR) with radial distance and stellar mass. We find that the fraction of star-forming group members is higher in the PPS regions dominated by recently accreted galaxies, whereas passive galaxies dominate the virialized regions. We observe a small decline in specific SFR of star-forming galaxies towards the group center by a factor $\sim 1.2$ with respect to field galaxies. Similar to cluster studies, we conclude for low-mass halos that star-forming group galaxies represent an infalling population from the field to the halo and show suppressed star formation.},

abstract = {We derive new self-consistent theoretical UV, optical, and IR diagnostics for the interstellar medium (ISM) pressure and electron density in the ionized nebulae of star-forming galaxies. Our UV diagnostics utilize the intercombination, forbidden, and resonance lines of silicon, carbon, aluminum, neon, and nitrogen. We also calibrate the optical and IR forbidden lines of oxygen, argon, nitrogen, and sulfur. We show that line ratios used as ISM pressure diagnostics depend on the gas-phase metallicity with a residual dependence on the ionization parameter of the gas. In addition, the traditional electron density diagnostic [S ii] $\lambda$6731/[S ii] $\lambda$6717 is strongly dependent on the gas-phase metallicity. We show how different emission-line ratios are produced in different ionization zones in our theoretical nebulae. The [S ii] and [O ii] ratios are produced in different zones and should not be used interchangeably to measure the electron density of the gas unless the electron temperature is known to be constant. We review the temperature and density distributions observed within H ii regions and discuss the implications of these distributions on measuring the electron density of the gas. Many H ii regions contain radial variations in density. We suggest that the ISM pressure is a more meaningful quantity to measure in H ii regions or galaxies. Specific combinations of line ratios can cover the full range of ISM pressures (4 {\textless} log(P/k) {\textless} 9). As H ii regions become resolved at increasingly high redshift through the next generation of telescopes, we anticipate that these diagnostics will be important for understanding the conditions around the young, hot stars from the early universe to the present day.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of local environment on the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) spanning a wide range of galaxy densities from the field up to dense cores of massive galaxy clusters. Data are drawn from a sample of eight fields from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. Deep photometry allow us to select mass-complete samples of galaxies down to 109M⊙. Taking advantage of > 4000 secure spectroscopic redshifts from ORELSE and precise photometric redshifts, we construct threedimensional density maps between 0.55 < z < 1.3 using a Voronoi tessellation approach. We find that the shape of the SMF depends strongly on local environment exhibited by a smooth, continual increase in the relative numbers of high- to low-mass galaxies towards denser environments. A straightforward implication is that local environment proportionally increases the efficiency of (a) destroying lower mass galaxies and/or (b) growth of higher mass galaxies. We also find a presence of this environmental dependence in the SMFs of starforming and quiescent galaxies, although not quite as strongly for the quiescent subsample. To characterize the connection between the SMFof field galaxies and that of denser environments, we devise a simple semi-empirical model. The model begins with a sample of ≈106 galaxies at zstart = 5 with stellar masses distributed according to the field. Simulated galaxies then evolve down to zfinal = 0.8 following empirical prescriptions for star-formation, quenching and galaxy-galaxy merging.We run the simulationmultiple times, testing a variety of scenarios with differing overall amounts of merging. Our model suggests that a large number of mergers are required to reproduce the SMF in dense environments. Additionally, a large majority of these mergers would have to occur in intermediate density environments (e.g. galaxy groups).},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ∼ 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915-0.01+0.02 (random)-0.42+0.14 (systematic) h70l0-2 M⊙ yr-1 Mpc-3 at z = 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (10100-1011 M ⊙), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 1010 M⊙. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408-0.002+0.005 (random) -0.090+0.029 (systematic)h70-1. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7-1.5-0.7 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA} break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {Galaxies that have fallen into massive haloes may no longer be able to accrete gas from their surroundings: a process referred to as 'starvation' or 'strangulation' of satellites. We study the environmental dependence of gas accretion on to galaxies using the cosmological, hydrodynamical EAGLE simulation. We quantify the dependence of gas accretion on stellar mass, redshift, and environment, using halo mass and galaxy overdensity as environmental indicators.We find a strong suppression, of many orders of magnitude, of the gas accretion rate in dense environments, primarily for satellite galaxies. This suppression becomes stronger at lower redshift. However, the scatter in accretion rates is very large for satellites. This is (at least in part) due to the variation in the halocentric radius, since gas accretion is more suppressed at smaller radii. Central galaxies are influenced less strongly by their environment and exhibit less scatter in their gas accretion rates. The star formation rates of both centrals and satellites show similar behaviour to their gas accretion rates. The relatively small differences between gas accretion and star formation rates demonstrate that galaxies generally exhaust their gas reservoir somewhat faster at higher stellar mass, lower redshift, and in denser environments. We conclude that the environmental suppression of gas accretion could directly result in the quenching of star formation.},

We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus-H II (AGN-H II) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [O III] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [O III] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[OIII]/$\sigma$4 which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[O III]/$\sigma$4 all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/LEDD and Seyferts dominant at high L/LEDD. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation Held with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {Aims. Star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point during hierarchical mass assembly. To understand where and when the quenching processes takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rate per unit total halo mass ($\Sigma$(SFR)/M) in three different mass scales: low mass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift z ≈ 1.6. Methods. We use deep far-infrared PACS data at 100 and 160 $\mu$m to accurately estimate the total star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9 clusters with mass ∼1015 M⊙, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ∼5 × 1013 M⊙. Estimates of the field $\Sigma$(SFR)/M are derived from the literature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comoving matter density of the universe. Results. The field $\Sigma$(SFR)/M increases with redshift up to z ∼ 1 and it is constant thereafter. The evolution of the $\Sigma$(SFR)/M-z relation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. Up to redshift z ∼ 0.2, the field has a higher $\Sigma$(SFR)/M than galaxy groups and galaxy clusters. At higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar $\Sigma$(SFR)/M, while massive clusters have significantly lower $\Sigma$(SFR)/M than both groups and the field. There is a hint of a reversal of the SFR activity vs. environment at z ∼ 1.6, where the group $\Sigma$(SFR)/M lies above the field $\Sigma$(SFR)/M-z relation. We discuss possible interpretations of our results in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching. {\textcopyright} 2012 ESO.},

abstract = {We study the role of the environment on galaxy evolution using a sample of 868 galaxies in the Virgo cluster and in its surrounding regions that are selected from the GALEX Ultraviolet Virgo Cluster Survey (GUViCS) with the purpose of understanding the origin of the red sequence in dense environments. The sample spans a wide range in morphological types (from dwarf ellipticals to Im and BCD) and stellar masses (107 Mstar 1011.5M{\^{a}}{\v{S}}™). We collected multifrequency data covering the whole electromagnetic spectrum for most of the galaxies, including UV, optical, mid-and far-infrared imaging data, as well as optical and HI spectroscopic data. We first identify the different dynamical substructures that compose the Virgo cluster, and we calculate the local density of galaxies using different methods. We then study the distribution of galaxies belonging to the red sequence, the green valley, and the blue cloud within the different cluster substructures or as a function of galaxy density. Our analysis indicates that all the most massive galaxies (Mstar 1011M{\^{a}}{\v{S}}™) are slow rotators and are the dominant galaxies of the different cluster substructures, which are generally associated with a diffuse X-ray emission. They are probably the result of major merging events that occurred at early epochs, as also indicated by their very old stellar populations. Slow rotators of lower stellar mass (108.5 Mstar 1011M{\^{a}}{\v{S}}™) are also preferentially located within the different high-density substructures of the cluster. Their position in the velocity space indicates that they are virialised within the cluster; thus, they are Virgo members since its formation. They have been shaped by gravitational perturbations occurring within the infalling groups that later form the cluster (pre-processing). On the contrary, low-mass star-forming systems are extremely rare in the inner regions of the Virgo cluster A, where the density of the intergalactic medium is at its maximum. Our ram pressure stripping models consistently indicate that these star-forming systems can be rapidly deprived of their interstellar medium during their interaction with the intergalactic medium. The lack of gas quenches their star-formation activity transforming them into quiescent dwarf ellipticals. This mild transformation does not perturb the kinematic properties of these galaxies, which still have rotation curves typical of star-forming systems.},

abstract = {We report the detection of CO(2-1) emission coincident with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of the high-redshift galaxy cluster SpARCS1049+56, with the Redshift Search Receiver (RSR) on the Large Millimetre Telescope (LMT). We confirm a spectroscopic redshift for the gas of z = 1.7091+/-0.0004, which is consistent with the systemic redshift of the cluster galaxies of z = 1.709. The line is well-fit by a single component Gaussian with a RSR resolution-corrected FWHM of 569+/-63 km/s. We see no evidence for multiple velocity components in the gas, as might be expected from the multiple image components seen in near-infrared imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope. We measure the integrated flux of the line to be 3.6+/-0.3 Jy km/s and, using alpha_CO = 0.8 Msun (K km s^-1 pc^2)^-1 we estimate a total molecular gas mass of 1.1+/-0.1x10^11 Msun and a M_H2/M_star $\sim$ 0.4. This is the largest gas reservoir detected in a BCG above z > 1 to date. Given the infrared-estimated star formation rate of 860+/-130 Msun/yr, this corresponds to a gas depletion timescale of $\sim$0.1Gyr. We discuss several possible mechanisms for depositing such a large gas reservoir to the cluster center -- e.g., a cooling flow, a major galaxy-galaxy merger or the stripping of gas from several galaxies -- but conclude that these LMT data are not sufficient to differentiate between them.},

abstract = {Cold-mode gas accretion onto galaxies is a direct prediction of LCDM simulations and provides galaxies with fuel that allows them to continue to form stars over the lifetime of the Universe. Given its dramatic influence on a galaxy's gas reservoir, gas accretion has to be largely responsible for how galaxies form and evolve. Therefore, given the importance of gas accretion, it is necessary to observe and quantify how these gas flows affect galaxy evolution. However, observational data have yet to conclusively show that gas accretion ubiquitously occurs at any epoch. Directly detecting gas accretion is a challenging endeavor and we now have obtained a significant amount of observational evidence to support it. This chapter reviews the current observational evidence of gas accretion onto star-forming galaxies.},

abstract = {Understanding the variability of galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) across a range of timescales provides insight into the underlying physical processes that regulate star formation within galaxies. We compile the SFHs of galaxies at z = 0 from an extensive set of models, ranging from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (Illustris, IllustrisTNG, Mufasa, Simba, EAGLE), zoom simulations (FIRE-2, g14, and Marvel/Justice League), semi-analytic models (Santa Cruz SAM) and empirical models (UniverseMachine), and quantify the variability of these SFHs on different timescales using the power spectral density (PSD) formalism. We find that the PSDs are well described by broken power-laws, and variability on long timescales (≳ 1 Gyr) accounts for most of the power in galaxy SFHs. Most hydrodynamical models show increased variability on shorter timescales (≲ 300 Myr) with decreasing stellar mass. Quenching can induce ∼0.4 − 1 dex of additional power on timescales >1 Gyr. The dark matter accretion histories of galaxies have remarkably self-similar PSDs and are coherent with the in-situ star formation on timescales >3 Gyr. There is considerable diversity among the different models in their (i) power due to SFR variability at a given timescale, (ii) amount of correlation with adjacent timescales (PSD slope), (iii) evolution of median PSDs with stellar mass, and (iv) presence and locations of breaks in the PSDs. The PSD framework is a useful space to study the SFHs of galaxies since model predictions vary widely. Observational constraints in this space will help constrain the relative strengths of the physical processes responsible for this variability.},

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare to those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early-types. The hosts of high- luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high- luminosity AGN have strong H$\delta$ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and QSOs with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

abstract = {We report a survey of molecular gas in galaxies in the XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 cluster at $z=1.46$. We have detected emission lines from 17 galaxies within a radius of $R_{200}$ from the cluster center, in Band 3 data of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with a coverage of 93 -- 95 GHz in frequency and 2.33 arcmin$^2$ in spatial direction. The lines are all identified as CO $J$=2--1 emission lines from cluster members at $z\sim1.46$ by their redshifts and the colors of their optical and near-infrared (NIR) counterparts. The line luminosities reach down to $L'_{\rm CO(2-1)}=4.5\times10^{9}$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$. The spatial distribution of galaxies with a detection of CO(2--1) suggests that they disappear from the very center of the cluster. The phase-space diagram showing relative velocity versus cluster-centric distance indicates that the gas-rich galaxies have entered the cluster more recently than the gas-poor star-forming galaxies and passive galaxies located in the virialized region of this cluster. The results imply that the galaxies have experienced ram-pressure stripping and/or strangulation during the course of infall towards the cluster center and then the molecular gas in the galaxies at the cluster center is depleted by star formation.},

abstract = {We study the structural evolution of isolated star-forming (SF) galaxies in the IllustrisTNG100-1 hydrodynamical simulation, with a focus on investigating the growth of the central core density within 2 kpc ($\Sigma$∗,2 kpc) in relation to total stellar mass (M∗) at z < 0.5. First, we show that several observational trends in the $\Sigma$∗,2 kpc-M∗ plane are qualitatively reproduced in IllustrisTNG, including the distributions of active galactic nuclei (AGN), SF galaxies, quiescent galaxies, and radial profiles of stellar age, specific star formation rate (sSFR), and metallicity. We find that galaxies with dense cores evolve parallel to the $\Sigma$∗,2 kpc-M∗ relation, while galaxies with diffuse cores evolve along shallower trajectories. We investigate possible drivers of rapid growth in $\Sigma$∗,2 kpc compared to M∗. Both the current sSFR gradient and the black hole (BH) accretion rate are indicators of past core growth, but are not predictors of future core growth. Major mergers (although rare in our sample; ∼10 per cent) cause steeper core growth, except for high-mass (M ∗ ≳ 1010 M $\Theta$) mergers, which are mostly dry. Disc instabilities, as measured by the fraction of mass with Toomre Q < 2, are not predictive of rapid core growth. Instead, rapid core growth results in more stable discs. The cumulative BH feedback history sets the maximum rate of core growth, preventing rapid growth in high-mass galaxies (≳ 109.5, M $\Theta$). For massive galaxies, the total specific angular momentum of accreting gas is the most important predictor of future core growth. Our results suggest that the angular momentum of accreting gas controls the slope, width, and zero-point evolution of the $\Sigma$∗,2 kpc-M∗ relation.},

Their uniformity in V/V{\_}max and co-moving volume density suggest they go even further, spanning a total time more than an order of magnitude larger than their instantaneous star formation times.

Those preceding could be the pre-merger objects that combined to make red spheroidal types at z{\$\sim${}}2 to 3. Clumpy disks that do not undergo mergers are likely to evolve into spirals. The morphology of clumpy disks, the size and separation of the clumps, and the prevalence of this type of structure in the early Universe suggests that most star formation occurs by self-gravitational collapse of disk gas.},

This method, when applied to a mock catalog with the photometric-redshift precision ({\$}\backslashsigma{\_}z / (1+z) \backslashlesssim 0.02{\$}), recovers galaxies in low- and high-density environments accurately. We quantify the environmental quenching efficiency, and show that at z{\textgreater} 0.5 it depends on galaxy stellar mass, demonstrating that the effects of quenching related to (stellar) mass and environment are not separable. In high-density environments, the mass and environmental quenching efficiencies are comparable for massive galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog (M/M{\_}\backslashodot)\backslashgtrsim{\$} 10.5) at all redshifts. For lower mass galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog (M/M){\_}\backslashodot) \backslashlesssim{\$} 10), the environmental quenching efficiency is very low at {\$}z\backslashgtrsim{\$} 1.5, but increases rapidly with decreasing redshift. Environmental quenching can account for nearly all quiescent lower mass galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog(M/M{\_}\backslashodot) \backslashsim{\$} 9-10), which appear primarily at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1.0. The morphologies of lower mass quiescent galaxies are inconsistent with those expected of recently quenched star-forming galaxies. Some environmental process must transform the morphologies on similar timescales as the environmental quenching itself. The evolution of the environmental quenching favors models that combine gas starvation (as galaxies become satellites) with gas exhaustion through star-formation and outflows ("overconsumption"), and additional processes such as galaxy interactions, tidal stripping and disk fading to account for the morphological differences between the quiescent and star-forming galaxy populations.},

abstract = {We present a panoramic narrow-band imaging survey of [Oii] emitters in and around the ClG J0218.3-0510 cluster at z= 1.62 with Suprime-Cam on Subaru Telescope. 352 [Oii] emitters were identified on the basis of narrow-band excesses and photometric redshifts. We discovered a huge filamentary structure with some clumps traced by [Oii] emitters and found that the ClG J0218.3-0510 cluster is embedded in an even larger superstructure than the one reported previously. 31 [Oii] emitters were spectroscopically confirmed with the detection of H$\alpha$ and/or [Oiii] emission lines by Fibre Multi Object Spectrograph observations. In the high-density regions such as cluster core and clumps, star-forming [Oii] emitters show a high overdensity by a factor of more than 10 compared to the field region. Interestingly, the relative fraction of [Oii] emitters in photo-z selected sample does not depend significantly on the local density. Although the star formation activity is very high even in the cluster core, some massive quiescent galaxies also exist at the same time. Furthermore, the properties of the individual [Oii] emitters, such as star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses and specific SFRs, do not show a significant dependence on the local density, either. Such a lack of environmental dependence is consistent with our earlier result by Hayashi et al. on a z= 1.5 cluster and its surrounding region. The fact that the star-forming activity of galaxies in the cluster core is as high as that in the field at z$\sim$ 1.6 may suggest that the star-forming galaxies are probably just in a transition phase from a starburst mode to a quiescent mode, and are thus showing comparable level of star formation rates to those in lower density environments. We may be witnessing the start of the reversal of the local SFR-density relation due to the 'biased' galaxy formation and evolution in high-density regions at this high redshift, beyond which massive galaxies would be forming vigorously in a more biased way in protocluster cores. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {We construct a sample of 75863 star-forming galaxies with robust metallicity and star formation rate (SFR) measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, from which we select a clean sample of compact group (CG) galaxies. The CGs are defined to be close configurations of at least four galaxies that are otherwise apparently isolated. Our selection results in a sample of 112 spectroscopically identified CG galaxies, which can be further divided into groups that are either embedded within a larger structure, such as a cluster or large group, or truly isolated systems. The CGs then serve as a probe into the influence of large-scale environment on a galaxy's evolution, while keeping the local density fixed at high values. We find that the SFRs of star-forming galaxies in CGs are significantly different between isolated and embedded systems. Galaxies in isolated systems show significantly enhanced SFR, relative to a control sample matched in mass and redshift, a trend not seen in the embedded systems. Galaxies in isolated systems exhibit a median SFR enhancement at a fixed stellar mass of +0.07 ± 0.03 dex. These dependences on large-scale environment are small in magnitude relative to the apparent influence of local-scale effects found in previous studies, but the significance of the difference in SFRs between our two samples constrains the effect of large-scale environment to be non-zero. We find no significant change in the gas-phase interstellar metallicity for either the isolated or embedded CG sample relative to their controls. However, simulated samples that include artificial offsets indicate that we are only sensitive to metallicity changes of log O/H> 0.13dex (at 99per cent confidence), which is considerably larger than the typical metallicity differences seen in previous environmental studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {We explore star-formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies based on the evolution of the star-formation rate stellar mass relation (SFR-M*). Using data from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) in combination with far-IR imaging from the Spitzer and Herschel observatories we measure the SFR-M* relation at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. Similar to recent works we find that the average infrared SEDs of galaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broad range of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations. We find that the SFR-M* relation is not consistent with a single power-law of the form SFR {\$\sim${}} M*{\^{}}a at any redshift; it has a power-law slope of a{\$\sim${}}1 at low masses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass (M{\_}0) that ranges from 10{\^{}}9.5 - 10{\^{}}10.8 Msol, with evidence that M{\_}0 increases with redshift. We compare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the SFR-M* relation albeit with systematic offsets. We use the evolving SFR-M* sequence to generate SFHs, finding that typical SFRs of individual galaxies rise at early times and decline after reaching a peak. This peak occurs earlier for more massive galaxies. We integrate these SFHs to generate mass-growth histories and compare to the implied mass-growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function. We find that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but that there is room for improvement at a more detailed level. At early times the SFHs suggest mass-growth rates that are as much as 10x higher than inferred from the stellar mass function. However, at later times the SFHs under-predict the inferred evolution, as is expected in the case of additional growth due to mergers.},

abstract = {Ever deeper and wider look-back surveys have led to a fairly robust outline of the cosmic star-formation history, which culminated around ; this period is often nicknamed "cosmic noon." Our knowledge about star-forming galaxies at these epochs has dramatically advanced from increasingly complete population censuses and detailed views of individual galaxies. We highlight some of the key observational insights that influenced our current understanding of galaxy evolution in the equilibrium growth picture: ▪Scaling relations between galaxy properties are fairly well established among massive galaxies at least out to , pointing to regulating mechanisms already acting on galaxy growth. ▪Resolved views reveal that gravitational instabilities and efficient secular processes within the gas- and baryon-rich galaxies at play an important role in the early buildup of galactic structure. ▪Ever more sensitive observations of kinematics at are probing the baryon and dark matter budget on galactic scales and the links between star-forming galaxies and their likely descendants. ▪Toward higher masses, massive bulges, dense cores, and powerful AGNs and AGN-driven outflows are more prevalent and likely play a role in quenching star formation. We outline emerging questions and exciting prospects for the next decade with upcoming instrumentation, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the next generation of extremely large telescopes.},

abstract = {The study of stellar populations in galaxies is entering a new era with the availability of large and high-quality data bases of both observed galactic spectra and state-of-the-art evolutionary synthesis models. In this paper we investigate the power of spectral synthesis as a means to estimate the physical properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more than the decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a base of simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities, producing as output the star formation and chemical histories of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. Our implementation of this method uses the recent models of Bruzual & Chariot and observed spectra in the 3650-8000 {\AA} range. The reliability of this approach is studied by three different means: (1) simulations, (2) comparison with previous work based on a different technique, and (3) analysis of the consistency of results obtained for a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that spectral synthesis provides reliable physical parameters as long as one does not attempt a very detailed description of the star formation and chemical histories. Robust and physically interesting parameters are obtained by combining the (individually uncertain) strengths of each simple stellar population in the base. In particular, we show that, besides providing excellent fits to observed galaxy spectra, this method is able to recover useful information on the distributions of stellar ages and, more importantly, stellar metallicities. Stellar masses, velocity dispersion and extinction are also found to be accurately retrieved for realistic signal-to-noise ratios. We apply this synthesis method to a volume-limited sample of 50 362 galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalogue of stellar population properties. Emission lines are also studied, their measurement being performed after subtracting the computed starlight spectrum from the observed one. A comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement, despite substantial differences in the methods of analysis. The confidence in the present method is further strengthened by several empirical and astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong correlations between stellar and nebular metallicities, stellar and nebular extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of H$\alpha$ and 4000-{\AA} break, and between stellar mass and velocity dispersion. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

The two galaxy cluster candidates were originally identified as overdensities of objects using deep mid-infrared imaging and observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and were subsequently followed up with HST/WFC3 imaging and grism observations. We identify galaxy-galaxy merger candidates using high resolution imaging with the WFC3 in the F105W, F125W, and F160W bands. Coarse redshifts for the same objects are obtained with grism observations in G102 for the z ∼ 1.6 cluster (IRC0222A) and G141 for the z ∼ 2 cluster (IRC0222B). Using visual classifications as well as a variety of selection techniques, we measure merger fractions of 11+8.2-3.2in IRC0222A and 18+7.8-4.5in IRC0222B. In comparison, we measure a merger fraction of 5.0+1.1-0.8% for field galaxies at z ∼ 2. Our study indicates that the galaxy-galaxy merger fraction in clusters at z ∼ 2 is enhanced compared the field population, but note that more cluster measurements at this epoch are needed to confirm our findings.},

abstract = {We make an in-depth comparison of the IllustrisTNG simulations with observational data on the quenched fractions of central and satellite galaxies, for $M_*=10^{9-12}M_{\odot}$ at $0\leq z\leq3$. We study how analysis methodologies and observational effects impact this comparison. This includes measurement choices -- aperture, quenched definition, star formation rate (SFR) indicator timescale -- as well as observational uncertainties and sample selection issues: projection effects, satellite/central misclassification, and host mass distribution sampling. The definition used to separate quenched and star-forming galaxies produces differences of up to 70 (30)$\%$ for centrals (satellites) $>\sim 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$. Increasing the aperture within which SFR is measured can suppress the quenched fractions by up to $\sim50\%$, particularly at $z\gtrsim2$. Proper consideration of the stellar and host mass distributions is crucial: naive comparisons to volume-limited samples from simulations lead to misinterpretation of the quenched fractions as a function of $z$ by up to 20$\%$. Including observational uncertainties to theoretical values of $M_*$ and SFR changes the quenched fraction values and their trend and/or slope with mass. Taking projected rather than 3D distances for satellites decreases the quenched fractions by up to 10$\%$ due to field contamination. Comparing with data, TNG produces quenched fractions broadly consistent with observations. TNG predicts quenched fractions up to $\sim80-90\%$ for centrals at $z\leq2-3$, in line with recent observations, and notably higher than other theoretical models. The quantitative agreement of TNG and SDSS for satellite quenched fractions in groups and clusters depends strongly on the galaxy and host mass range. Our mock comparison between TNG and SDSS highlights the importance of properly accounting for observational effects and biases.},

abstract = {We use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the SDSS to study how structure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and on stellar mass. Local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixed absolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 Mpc in projected radius and +-500 km/s in depth. The stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by nearly a factor of two towards higher masses between low and high density regions. At fixed stellar mass, both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly on local density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration are almost independent of it. The galaxy property most sensitive to environment is specific star formation rate. For galaxies with stellar masses less than 3 x 10^10 M_sun, the median SFR/M* decreases by more than a factor of 10 from low to high densities. This decrease is less marked for massive galaxies. At fixed stellar mass, twice as many galaxies host AGN with strong [OIII] emission in low density regions as in high. Massive galaxies in low-density environments also contain more dust. We have analyzed correlations between spectroscopic indicators that probe SFH on different timescales (D4000, Hdelta_A and SFR/M*). The correlations do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease in star formation has ocurred over long (>1 Gyr) timescales. Since structure does not depend on environment for more massive galaxies, trends in recent SFH, dust and AGN for these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure, e.g. mergers. The SFH-density correlation is strongest for small scale (< 1 Mpc) estimates of local density. Finally, we highlight a striking similarity between changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as a function of redshift and we interpret this using N-body simulations.},

abstract = {We use a large suite of carefully controlled full hydrodynamic simulations to study the ram pressure stripping of the hot gaseous haloes of galaxies as they fall into massive groups and clusters. The sensitivity of the results to the orbit, total galaxy mass, and galaxy structural properties is explored. For typical structural and orbital parameters, we find that ∼30 per cent of the initial hot galactic halo gas can remain in place after 10 Gyr. We propose a physically simple analytic model that describes the stripping seen in the simulations remarkably well. The model is analogous to the original formulation of Gunn & Gott, except that it is appropriate for the case of a spherical (hot) gas distribution (as opposed to a face-on cold disc) and takes into account that stripping is not instantaneous but occurs on a characteristic time-scale. The model reproduces the results of the simulations to within ≈10 per cent at almost all times for all the orbits, mass ratios, and galaxy structural properties we have explored. The one exception involves unlikely systems where the orbit of the galaxy is highly non-radial and its mass exceeds about 10 per cent of the group or cluster into which it is falling (in which case the model underpredicts the stripping following pericentric passage). The proposed model has several interesting applications, including modelling the ram pressure stripping of both observed and cosmologically simulated galaxies and as a way to improve present semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. One immediate consequence is that the colours and morphologies of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters will differ significantly from those predicted with the standard assumption of complete stripping of the hot coronae. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.

abstract = {We report the likely identification of a substantial population of massive M 1011 M galaxies at z 4 with suppressed star formation rates (SFRs), selected on rest-frame optical to near-IR colors from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE). The observed spectral energy distributions show pronounced breaks, sampled by a set of near-IR medium-bandwidth filters, resulting in tightly constrained photometric redshifts. Fitting stellar population models suggests large Balmer/4000 breaks, relatively old stellar populations, large stellar masses, and low SFRs, with a median specific SFR of 2.9 ± 1.8 × 10-11 yr-1. Ultradeep Herschel/PACS 100 $\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m and Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu$m data reveal no dust-obscured SFR activity for 15/19(79%) galaxies. Two far-IR detected galaxies are obscured QSOs. Stacking the far-IR undetected galaxies yields no detection, consistent with the spectral energy distribution fit, indicating independently that the average specific SFR is at least 10 × smaller than that of typical star-forming galaxies at z 4. Assuming all far-IR undetected galaxies are indeed quiescent, the volume density is 1.8 ± 0.7 × 10 -5 Mpc-3 to a limit of log 10 M/M ≥ 10.6, which is 10 × and 80 × lower than at z = 2 and z = 0.1. They comprise a remarkably high fraction (35%) of z 4 massive galaxies, suggesting that suppression of star formation was efficient even at very high redshift. Given the average stellar age of 0.8 Gyr and stellar mass of 0.8 × 10 11 M, the galaxies likely started forming stars before z = 5, with SFRs well in excess of 100 M yr-1, far exceeding that of similarly abundant UV-bright galaxies at z ≥ 4. This suggests that most of the star formation in the progenitors of quiescent z 4 galaxies was obscured by dust. {\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

abstract = {We use the IllustrisTNG simulations to investigate the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for star-forming cluster galaxies as a function of the formation history of their cluster host. The simulations predict an enhancement in the gas-phase metallicities of star-forming cluster galaxies (10^9< M_star<10^10 M_sun) at z<1.0 in comparisons to field galaxies. This is qualitatively consistent with observations. We find that the metallicity enhancement of cluster galaxies appears prior to their infall into the central cluster potential, indicating for the first time a systematic "chemical pre-processing" signature for {\it infalling} cluster galaxies. Namely, galaxies which will fall into a cluster by z=0 show a $\sim$0.05 dex enhancement in the MZR compared to field galaxies at z<0.5. Based on the inflow rate of gas into cluster galaxies and its metallicity, we identify that the accretion of pre-enriched gas is the key driver of the chemical evolution of such galaxies, particularly in the stellar mass range (10^9< M_star<10^10 M_sun). We see signatures of an environmental dependence of the ambient/inflowing gas metallicity which extends well outside the nominal virial radius of clusters. Our results motivate future observations looking for pre-enrichment signatures in dense environments.},

abstract = {We present the first observation of cluster-scale radial metallicity gradients from star-forming galaxies. We use the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck II telescope to observe two CLASH clusters at z$\sim$0.35: MACS1115+0129 and RXJ1532+3021. Based on our measured interstellar medium (ISM) properties of star-forming galaxies out to a radius of 2.5 Mpc from the cluster centre, we find that the galaxy metallicity decreases as a function of projected cluster-centric distance (-0.15+/-0.08 dex/Mpc) in MACS1115+01. On the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), star-forming galaxies in MACS1115+01 are offset to higher metallicity ($\sim$0.2 dex) than the local SDSS galaxies at a fixed mass range. In contrast, the MZR of RXJ1532+30 is consistent with the local comparison sample. RXJ1532+30 exhibits a bimodal radial metallicity distribution, with one branch showing a similar negative gradient as MACS1115+01 (-0.14+/-0.05 dex/Mpc) and the other branch showing a positive radial gradient. The positive gradient branch in RXJ1532+30 is likely caused by either interloper galaxies or an in-plane merger, indicating that cluster-scale abundance gradients probe cluster substructures and thus the dynamical state of a cluster. Most strikingly, we discover that neither the radial metallicity gradient nor the offset from the MZR is driven by the stellar mass. We compare our observations with Rhapsody-G cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of relaxed galaxy clusters and find that the simulated galaxy cluster also exhibits a negative abundance gradient, albeit with a shallower slope (-0.04+/-0.03 dex/Mpc). Our observations suggest that the negative radial gradient originates from ram-pressure stripping and/or strangulation processes in the cluster environments.},

abstract = {Galaxies that have fallen into massive haloes may no longer be able to accrete gas from their surroundings: a process referred to as 'starvation' or 'strangulation' of satellites. We study the environmental dependence of gas accretion on to galaxies using the cosmological, hydrodynamical EAGLE simulation. We quantify the dependence of gas accretion on stellar mass, redshift, and environment, using halo mass and galaxy overdensity as environmental indicators.We find a strong suppression, of many orders of magnitude, of the gas accretion rate in dense environments, primarily for satellite galaxies. This suppression becomes stronger at lower redshift. However, the scatter in accretion rates is very large for satellites. This is (at least in part) due to the variation in the halocentric radius, since gas accretion is more suppressed at smaller radii. Central galaxies are influenced less strongly by their environment and exhibit less scatter in their gas accretion rates. The star formation rates of both centrals and satellites show similar behaviour to their gas accretion rates. The relatively small differences between gas accretion and star formation rates demonstrate that galaxies generally exhaust their gas reservoir somewhat faster at higher stellar mass, lower redshift, and in denser environments. We conclude that the environmental suppression of gas accretion could directly result in the quenching of star formation.},

abstract = {We present results from a ≈100 ks Chandra observation of the 2QZ Cluster 1004+00 structure at z = 2.23 (hereafter 2QZ Clus). 2QZ Clus was originally identified as an overdensity of four optically-selected QSOs at z = 2.23 within a 15 × 15 arcmin2 region. Narrow-band imaging in the near-IR (within the K band) revealed that the structure contains an additional overdensity of 22 z = 2.23 H$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (HAEs), resulting in 23 unique z = 2.23 HAEs/QSOs (22 within the Chandra field of view). Our Chandra observations reveal that three HAEs in addition to the four QSOs harbor powerfully accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with 2-10 keV luminosities of ≈(8-60) × 1043 erg s-1 and X-ray spectral slopes consistent with unobscured active galactic nucleus (AGN). Using a large comparison sample of 210 z = 2.23 HAEs in the Chandra-COSMOS field (C-COSMOS), we find suggestive evidence that the AGN fraction increases with local HAE galaxy density. The 2QZ Clus HAEs reside in a moderately overdense environment (a factor of ≈2 times over the field), and after excluding optically-selected QSOs, we find that the AGN fraction is a factor of ≈3.5+3.8-2.2 times higher than C-COSMOS HAEs in similar environments. Using stacking analyses of the Chandra data and Herschel SPIRE observations at 250 $\mu$m, we respectively estimate mean SMBH accretion rates () and star formation rates (SFRs) for the 2QZ Clus and C-COSMOS samples. We find that the mean 2QZ Clus HAE stacked X-ray luminosity is QSO-like (L 2-10 keV ≈ [6-10] × 1043 erg s-1), and the implied /SFR ≈ (1.6-3.2) × 10-3 is broadly consistent with the local M BH/M relation and z ≈ 2 X-ray selected AGN. In contrast, the C-COSMOS HAEs are on average an order of magnitude less X-ray luminous and have /SFR ≈ (0.2-0.4) × 10-3, somewhat lower than the local M BH/M relation, but comparable to that found for z ≈ 1-2 star-forming galaxies with similar mean X-ray luminosities. We estimate that a periodic QSO phase with duty cycle ≈2%-8% would be sufficient to bring star-forming galaxies onto the local M BH/M relation. This duty cycle is broadly consistent with the observed C-COSMOS HAE AGN fraction (≈0.4%-2.3%) for powerful AGN with L X ≳ 1044 erg s-1. Future observations of 2QZ Clus will be needed to identify key factors responsible for driving the mutual growth of the SMBHs and galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) which reside at the centres of galaxies can inject vast amounts of energy into the surrounding gas and are thought to be a viable mechanism to quench star-formation in massive galaxies. Here we study the $10^{9\textrm{--}12.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar mass central galaxy population of the IllustrisTNG simulation, specifically the TNG100 and TNG300 volumes at \zeq{0}, and show how the three components -- SMBH, galaxy, and circumgalactic medium (CGM) -- are interconnected in their evolution. We find that gas entropy is a sensitive diagnostic of feedback injection. In particular, we demonstrate how the onset of the low-accretion BH feedback mode, realised in the IllustrisTNG model as a kinetic, BH-driven wind, leads not only to star-formation quenching at stellar masses $\gtrsim10^{10.5}\mathrm{M_\odot}$ but also to a change in thermodynamic properties of the (\emph{non}-star-forming) gas, both within the galaxy and beyond. The IllustrisTNG kinetic feedback from SMBHs increases the average gas entropy, within the galaxy and in the CGM, lengthening typical gas cooling times from $10\textrm{--}100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ to $1\textrm{--}10\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, effectively ceasing ongoing star-formation and inhibiting radiative cooling and future gas accretion. In practice, the same AGN feedback channel is simultaneously `ejective' and `preventative' and leaves an imprint on the temperature, density, entropy, and cooling times also in the outer reaches of the gas halo, up to distances of several hundred kiloparsecs. In the IllustrisTNG model, a long-lasting quenching state can occur for a heterogeneous CGM, whereby the hot and dilute CGM gas of quiescent galaxies contains regions of low-entropy gas with short cooling times.},

abstract = {We investigate the properties of galaxies between the blue and the red sequence (i.e. the transition region, 4.5 < NUV - H < 6 mag) by combining ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared imaging to 21-cm H i line observations for a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies. We confirm the existence of a tight relation between colour and H i fraction across all the range of colours, although outside the blue cloud this trend becomes gradually weaker. Transition galaxies are divided into two different families, according to their atomic hydrogen content. 'H i-deficient' galaxies are the majority of transition galaxies in our sample. They are found in high-density environments and all their properties are consistent with a quenching of the star formation via gas stripping. However, while the migration from the blue cloud is relatively quick (i.e. ≲1 Gyr), a longer amount of time (a few Gyr at least) seems required to completely suppress the star formation and reach the red sequence. At all masses, migrating 'H i-deficient' galaxies are mainly discs, implying that the mechanism responsible for today's migration in clusters cannot have played a significant role in the creation of the red sequence at high redshift. Conversely, 'H i-normal' transition galaxies are a more heterogeneous population. A significant fraction of these objects show star formation in ring-like structures and evidence for accretion/minor-merging events suggesting that at least part of the H i reservoir has an external origin. The detailed evolution of such systems is still unclear, but our analysis suggests that, in at least two cases, galaxies might have migrated back from the red sequence after accretion events. Interestingly, the H i available may be sufficient to sustain star formation at the current rate for several billion years. Our study clearly shows the variety of evolutionary paths leading to the transition region and suggests that the transition galaxies may not be always associated with systems quickly migrating from the blue to the red sequence. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {This paper presents the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of nearby galaxies with the aim of furthering our understanding of the different processes involved in the formation and evolution of galaxies. To this end, we apply the fossil record method of stellar population synthesis to a rich and diverse data set of 436 galaxies observed with integral field spectroscopy in the CALIFA survey. The sample covers a wide range of Hubble types, with stellar masses ranging from M∗ ∼ 109 to 7 × 1011 M⊙. Spectral synthesis techniques are applied to the datacubes to retrieve the spatially resolved time evolution of the star formation rate (SFR), its intensity ($\Sigma$SFR), and other descriptors of the 2D SFH in seven bins of galaxy morphology (E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sbc, Sc, and Sd) and five bins of stellar mass. Our main results are that (a) galaxies form very fast independently of their current stellar mass, with the peak of star formation at high redshift (z > 2). Subsequent star formation is driven by M∗ and morphology, with less massive and later type spirals showing more prolonged periods of star formation. (b) At any epoch in the past, the SFR is proportional to M∗, with most massive galaxies having the highest absolute (but lowest specific) SFRs. (c) While today, the $\Sigma$SFR is similar for all spirals and significantly lower in early-type galaxies (ETG), in the past, the $\Sigma$SFR scales well with morphology. The central regions of today's ETGs are where the $\Sigma$SFR reached the highest values (> 103 M⊙ Gyr-1 pc-2), similar to those measured in high-redshift star-forming galaxies. (d) The evolution of $\Sigma$SFR in Sbc systems matches that of models for Milky Way-like galaxies, suggesting that the formation of a thick disk may be a common phase in spirals at early epochs. (e) The SFR and $\Sigma$SFR in outer regions of E and S0 galaxies show that they have undergone an extended phase of growth in mass between z = 2 and 0.4. The mass assembled in this phase is in agreement with the two-phase scenario proposed for the formation of ETGs. (f) Evidence of an early and fast quenching is found only in the most massive (M∗ > 2 × 1011 M⊙) E galaxies of the sample, but not in spirals of similar mass, suggesting that halo quenching is not the main mechanism for the shut down of star formation in galaxies. Less massive E and disk galaxies show more extended SFHs and a slow quenching. (g) Evidence of fast quenching is also found in the nuclei of ETG and early spirals, with SFR and $\Sigma$SFR indicating that they can be the relic of the "red nuggets" detected at high redshift.},

We begin by discussing angular momentum in dark matter halos, with a brief review of tidal torque theory and the importance of mergers, followed by a discussion of the canonical picture of galaxy formation within this framework, where halo gas is presumed to shock-heat to the virial temperature of the halo, following the same spin distribution as the dark matter halo before cooling to the center of the halo to form a galaxy there. In the context of recent observational evidence demonstrating the presence of high angular momentum gas in galaxy halos, we review recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that have begun to emphasize the role of "cold flow" accretion---anisotropic gas accretion along cosmic filaments that does not shock-heat before sinking to the central galaxy. We discuss the implications of these simulations, reviewing a number of recent developments in the literature, and suggest a revision to the canonical model as it relates to the expected angular momentum content of gaseous halos around galaxies.},

abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here, we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multivariate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This galaxy-halo connection provides a key test of physical galaxy-formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy-formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10 12 M o, less than 20% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

abstract = {We present VLA HI observations of JO206, a prototypical ram-pressure stripped galaxy in the GASP sample. This massive galaxy (M$_{\ast} =$ 8.5 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) is located at a redshift of $z =$ 0.0513, near the centre of the low-mass galaxy cluster, IIZw108 ($\sigma \sim575$ km/s). JO206 is characterised by a long tail ($\geq$90 kpc) of ionised gas stripped away by ram-pressure. We find a similarly long HI tail in the same direction as the ionised gas tail and measure a total HI mass of $3.2 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. This is about half the expected HI mass given the stellar mass and surface density of JO206. A total of $1.8 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ (60%) of the detected HI is in the gas stripped tail. An analysis of the star formation rate shows that the galaxy is forming more stars compared to galaxies with the same stellar and HI mass. On average we find a HI gas depletion time of $\sim$0.5 Gyr which is about four times shorter than that of "normal" spiral galaxies. We performed a spatially resolved analysis of the relation between star formation rate density and gas density in the disc and tail of the galaxy at the resolution of our HI data. The star formation efficiency of the disc is about 10 times higher than that of the tail at fixed HI surface densities. Both the inner and outer parts of JO206 show an enhanced star formation compared to regions of similar HI surface density in field galaxies. The enhanced star formation is due to ram-pressure stripping during the galaxy's first infall into the cluster.},

abstract = {We examine the accretion and merger histories of central and satellite galaxies in a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) cosmological simulation that resolves galaxies down to 7 × 109 M⊙. Most friends-of-friends haloes in the simulation have a distinct central galaxy, typically 2-5 times more massive than the most massive satellite. As expected, satellites have systematically higher assembly redshifts than central galaxies of the same baryonic mass, and satellites in more massive haloes form earlier. However, contrary to the simplest expectations, satellite galaxies continue to accrete gas and convert it to stars; the gas accretion declines steadily over a period of 0.5-1 Gyr after the satellite halo merges with a larger parent halo. Satellites in a cluster mass halo eventually begin to lose baryonic mass. Typically, satellites in our simulation are 0.1-0.2 mag bluer than in models that assume no gas accretion on to satellites after a halo merger. Since z = 1, 27 per cent of central galaxies (above 3 × 1010 M ⊙) and 22 per cent of present-day satellite galaxies have merged with a smaller system above a 1:4 mass ratio; about half of the satellite mergers occurred after the galaxy became a satellite and half before. In effect, satellite galaxies can remain 'central' objects of halo substructures, with continuing accretion and mergers, making the transition in assembly histories and physical properties a gradual one. Implementing such a gradual transformation in semi-analytic models would improve their agreement with observed colour distributions of satellite galaxies in groups and with the observed colour dependence of galaxy clustering. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation appear to show a "two-phase" character with a rapid early phase at z≳2 duringwhich "in situ" stars are formedwithin the galaxy from infalling cold gas followed by an extended phase since z≲3 duringwhich "ex situ" stars are primarily accreted. In the latter phase, massive systems growconsiderably in mass and radius by accretion of smaller satellite stellar systems formed at quite early times (z {\textgreater} 3) outside of the virial radius of the forming central galaxy. These tentative conclusions are obtained from high-resolution resimulations of 39 individual galaxies in a full cosmological context with present-day virial halomasses ranging from 7×10 11M⊙ h -1 ≲ Mvir ≲ 2.7×1013M⊙ h -1 (h = 0.72) and central galaxy masses between 4.5×1010M⊙ h -1 ≲ M* ≲ 3.6 × 1011M⊙ h -1. The simulations include the effects of a uniform UV background, radiative cooling, star formation, and energetic feedback from Type II supernova. The importance of stellar accretion increases with galaxy mass and toward lower redshift. In our simulations, lower mass galaxies (M* ≲ 9 × 10 10M⊙ h -1) accrete about 60{\%} of their present-day stellar mass. High-mass galaxy (M* ≳ 1.7 × 10 11M⊙ h -1) assembly is dominated by accretion and merging with about 80{\%} of the stars added by the present day. In general the simulated galaxies approximately double their mass since z = 1. For massive systems this mass growth is not accompanied by significant star formation. The majority of the in situ created stars are formed at z {\textgreater} 2, primarily out of cold gas flows. We recover the observational result of "archaeological downsizing," where the most massive galaxies harbor the oldest stars. We find that this is not in contradiction with hierarchical structure formation. Most stars in the massive galaxies are formed early on in smaller structures; the galaxies themselves are assembled late. {\textcopyright}2010. The American Astronomical Society.

Exploring a number of models for reionization feedback and the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from the galactic environment (fesc), we quantify how the contribution of star-forming galaxies (with halo masses $M_\mathrm{ h}\gt 10^{8.2}\, {\rm \rm M_\odot }$) to reionization depends on the radiative feedback model, fesc, and the environmental overdensity. Our key findings are: (i) for constant fesc models, intermediate-mass galaxies (with halo masses of $M_\mathrm{ h}\simeq 10^{9-11}\, {\rm \rm M_\odot }$ and absolute UV magnitudes of MUV ∼ −15 to −20) in intermediate-density regions (with overdensity log10(1 + $\delta$) ∼ 0−0.8 on a 2 comoving Mpc spatial scale) drive reionization; (ii) scenarios where fesc increases with decreasing halo mass shift, the galaxy population driving reionization to lower mass galaxies ($M_\mathrm{ h}\lesssim 10^{9.5}\, {\rm \rm M_\odot }$) with lower luminosities (MUV ≳ −16) and overdensities [log10(1 + $\delta$) ∼ 0−0.5 on a 2 comoving Mpc spatial scale]; (iii) reionization imprints its topology on the ionizing emissivity of low-mass galaxies ($M_h\lesssim 10^{9}\, {\rm \rm M_\odot }$] through radiative feedback. Low-mass galaxies experience a stronger suppression of star formation by radiative feedback and show lower ionizing emissivities in overdense regions; (iv) a change in fesc with galaxy properties has the largest impact on the sources of reionization and their detectability, with the radiative feedback strength and environmental overdensity playing a sub-dominant role; (v) James Webb Space Telescope-surveys (with a limiting magnitude of MUV = −16) will be able to detect the galaxies providing ${\sim}60{-}70{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ (${\sim}10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$) of reionization photons at z = 7 for constant fesc models (scenarios where fesc increases with decreasing halo mass).},

The relation is relatively steep from 10{\^{}}{\{}8.5{\}} - 10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}} M{\_}sun, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}} M{\_}sun. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the H-alpha luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anti-correlated with baryonic mass, with low mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal-depleted than L* galaxies at z{\$\sim${}}0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies, but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} M{\_}sun. We interpret this as strong evidence both of the ubiquity of galactic winds and of their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.},

abstract = {Galaxies represent one of the preferred candidate sources to drive the reionization of the universe. Even as gains are made in mapping the galaxy UV luminosity density to z>6, significant uncertainties remain regarding the conversion to the implied ionizing emissivity. The relevant unknowns are the Lyman-continuum (LyC) photon production efficiency xi_{ion} and the escape fraction f_{esc}. As we show here, the first of these unknowns is directly measureable in z=4-5 galaxies, based on the impact the Halpha line has on the observed IRAC fluxes. By computing a LyC photon production rate from the implied Halpha luminosities for a broad selection of z=4-5 galaxies and comparing this against the dust-corrected UV-continuum luminosities, we provide the first-ever direct estimates of the LyC photon production efficiency xi_{ion} for the z>$\sim$4 galaxy population. We find log_{10} xi_{ion}/[Hz/ergs] to have a mean value of 25.27_{-0.03}^{+0.03} and 25.34_{-0.02}^{+0.02} for sub-L* z=4-5 galaxies adopting Calzetti and SMC dust laws, respectively. Reassuringly, both values are consistent with standardly assumed xi_{ion}'s in reionization models, with a slight preference for higher xi_{ion}'s (by $\sim$0.1 dex) adopting the SMC dust law. A modest $\sim$0.03-dex increase in these estimates would result if the escape fraction for ionizing photons is non-zero and galaxies dominate the ionizing emissivity at z$\sim$4.4. High values of xi_{ion} ($\sim$25.5-25.8 dex) are derived for the bluest galaxies (beta<-2.3) in our samples, independent of dust law and consistent with results for a z=7.045 galaxy. Such elevated values of xi_{ion} would have important consequences, indicating that f_{esc} cannot be in excess of 13% unless the galaxy UV luminosity function does not extend down to -13 mag or the clumping factor is greater than 3. A low escape fraction would fit well with the low rate of LyC leakage observed at z$\sim$3.},

abstract = {Aims. We study the relationship between the local environment of galaxies and their star formation rate (SFR) in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, GOODS, at z ∼ 1. Methods. We use ultradeep imaging at 24 $\mu$m with the MIPS camera onboard Spitzer to determine the contribution of obscured light to the SFR of galaxies over the redshift range 0.8 ≤ z ≤ 1.2. Accurate galaxy densities are measured thanks to the large sample of ∼1200 spectroscopic redshifts with high (∼70%) spectroscopic completeness. Morphology and stellar masses are derived from deep HST-ACS imaging, supplemented by ground based imaging programs and photometry from the IRAC camera onboard Spitzer. Results. We show that the star formation-density relation observed locally was reversed at z ∼ 1: the average SFR of an individual galaxy increased with local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age. Hierarchical galaxy formation models (simulated lightcones from the Millennium model) predicted such a reversal to occur only at earlier epochs (z > 2) and at a lower level. We present a remarkable structure at z ∼ 1.016, containing X-ray traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into a Virgo-like cluster. This structure illustrates how the individual SFR of galaxies increases with density and shows that it is the ∼1-2 Mpc scale that affects most the star formation in galaxies at z ∼ 1. The SFR of z ∼ 1 galaxies is found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role in the observed star formation-density trend. However the specific SFR (=SFR/M*) decreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, which implies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activity of galaxies. Major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major cause for this effect since nearly half (46%) of the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) at z ∼ 1 present the HST-ACS morphology of spirals, while only a third present a clear signature of major mergers. The remaining galaxies are divided into compact (9%) and irregular (14%) galaxies. Moreover, the specific SFR of major mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals. Conclusions. These findings constrain the influence of the growth of large-scale structures on the star formation history of galaxies. Reproducing the SFR-density relation at z ∼ 1 is a new challenge for models, requiring a correct balance between mass assembly through mergers and in-situ star formation at early epochs. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

We have identified 117 galaxies (1.98 < z < 2.56), with $8.9\leq$log(M/M$_{\odot}$)$\leq11.0$, for which we can measure gas-phase metallicities. For the first time, we show discernible difference between the mass-metallicity relation, using individual galaxies, when deviding the sample by low ($<10$$\sim$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) and high ($>10$$\sim$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) SFRs. At fixed mass, low star-forming galaxies tend to have higher metallicity than high star-forming galaxies. Using a few basic assumptions, we further show that the gas masses and metallicities required to produce the fundamental mass--metallicity relation, and its intrinsic scatter, are consistent with cold-mode accretion predictions obtained from the OWLS hydrodynamical simulations. Our results from both simulations and observations are suggestive that cold-mode accretion is responsible for the fundamental mass-metallicity relation at $z=2$ and demonstrates the direct relationship between cosmological accretion and the fundamental properties of galaxies.},

abstract = {We present the deepest 100 to 500 $\mu$m far-infrared observations obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the GOODS-Herschel key program, and examine the infrared (IR) 3-500 $\mu$m spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at 0 < z < 2.5, supplemented by a local reference sample from IRAS, ISO, Spitzer, and AKARI data.We determine the projected star formation densities of local galaxies from their radio and mid-IR continuum sizes. We find that the ratio of total IR luminosity to rest-frame 8 $\mu$m luminosity, IR8 (?Ltot IR/L8), follows a Gaussian distribution centered on IR8 = 4 ($\delta$ = 1.6) and defines an IR main sequence for star-forming galaxies independent of redshift and luminosity. Outliers from this main sequence produce a tail skewed toward higher values of IR8. This minority population (<20%) is shown to consist of starbursts with compact projected star formation densities. IR8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of star formation from compact starbursts with high-IR8, high projected IR surface brightness ($\sigma$IR > 3 y 1010 L kpc?2) and a high specific star formation rate (i.e., starbursts). The rest-frame, UV-2700A size of these distant starbursts is typically half that of main sequence galaxies, supporting the correlation between star formation density and starburst activity that is measured for the local sample. Locally, luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies, (U)LIRGs (Ltot IR > 1011 L), are systematically in the starburst mode, whereas most distant (U)LIRGs form stars in the "normal" main sequence mode. This confusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called "mid-IR excess" population of galaxies found at z > 1.5 by previous studies. Main sequence galaxies have strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission line features, a broad far-IR bump resulting from a combination of dust temperatures (Tdust ∼ 15-50 K), and an effective Tdust ∼ 31 K, as derived from the peak wavelength of their infrared SED. Galaxies in the starburst regime instead exhibit weak PAH equivalent widths and a sharper far-IR bump with an effective Tdust ∼ 40 K. Finally, we present evidence that the mid-To-far IR emission of X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGN) is predominantly produced by star formation and that candidate dusty AGNs with a power-law emission in the mid-IR systematically occur in compact, dusty starbursts. After correcting for the effect of starbursts on IR8, we identify new candidates for extremely obscured AGNs.},

abstract = {We study the shape of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) of a combined sample of present-day dwarf and high-mass star-forming galaxies using IZI, a Bayesian formalism for measuring chemical abundances presented in Blanc et al. 2015. We observe a characteristic stellar mass scale at $M_* \simeq 10^{9.5}$M$_{\odot}$, above which the ISM undergoes a sharp increase in its level of chemical enrichment. In the $10^{6}-10^{9.5}$M$_{\odot}$ range the MZR follows a shallow power-law ($Z\propto M^{\alpha}_*$) with slope $\alpha=0.14\pm0.08$. At approaching $M_* \simeq 10^{9.5}$M$_{\odot}$ the MZR steepens significantly, showing a slope of $\alpha=0.37\pm0.08$ in the $10^{9.5}-10^{10.5}$M$_{\odot}$ range, and a flattening towards a constant metallicity at higher stellar masses. This behavior is qualitatively different from results in the literature that show a single power-law MZR towards the low mass end. We thoroughly explore systematic uncertainties in our measurement, and show that the shape of the MZR is not induced by sample selection, aperture effects, a changing N/O abundance, the adopted methodology used to construct the MZR, secondary dependencies on star formation activity, nor diffuse ionized gas (DIG) contamination, but rather on differences in the method used to measure abundances. High resolution hydrodynamical simulations can qualitatively reproduce our result, and suggest a transition in the ability of galaxies to retain their metals for stellar masses above this threshold. The MZR characteristic mass scale also coincides with a transition in the scale height and clumpiness of cold gas disks, and a typical gas fraction below which the efficiency of star formation feedback for driving outflows is expected to decrease sharply.},

abstract = {Large-scale structures (LSSs) out to z < 3.0 are measured in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) using extremely accurate photometric redshifts (photoz). The Ks -band-selected sample (from Ultra-Vista) is comprised of 155,954 galaxies. Two techniques - adaptive smoothing and Voronoi tessellation - are used to estimate the environmental densities within 127 redshift slices. Approximately 250 statistically significant overdense structures are identified out to z = 3.0 with shapes varying from elongated filamentary structures to more circularly symmetric concentrations. We also compare the densities derived for COSMOS with those based on semi-analytic predictions for a $\Lambda$CDM simulation and find excellent overall agreement between the mean densities as a function of redshift and the range of densities. The galaxy properties (stellar mass, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and star formation rates (SFRs)) are strongly correlated with environmental density and redshift, particularly at z < 1.0-1.2. Classifying the spectral type of each galaxy using the rest-frame b-i color (from the photoz SED fitting), we find a strong correlation of early-type galaxies (E-Sa) with high-density environments, while the degree of environmental segregation varies systematically with redshift out to z ∼ 1.3. In the highest density regions, 80% of the galaxies are early types at z = 0.2 compared to only 20% at z = 1.5. The SFRs and the star formation timescales exhibit clear environmental correlations. At z > 0.8, the SFR density is uniformly distributed over all environmental density percentiles, while at lower redshifts the dominant contribution is shifted to galaxies in lower density environments. {\textcopyright} 2013.

Here, we present the results of follow-up multi-object spectroscopy using OSIRIS at Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) of 16 Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidates discovered in the Subaru/XMM Newton Deep Survey. We have securely confirmed 10 LAEs with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line. The inferred star formation rates of the confirmed LAEs are on the low side, within the range 0.9-4.7 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. However, they show relatively high Ly$\alpha$ rest frame equivalent widths. Finally we have shown that the mechanical energy released by the star formation episodes in these galaxies is enough to create holes in the neutral hydrogen medium such that Lyman continuum photons can escape to the intergalactic medium, thus contributing to the re-ionisation of the Universe.},

Strong rest-frame optical [O III] and Hbeta emission lines were detected in 18 LBGs. The median flux ratio of [O III]5007 to Hbeta is 5.1+/-0.5, a factor of 5-10x higher than in local galaxies with similar stellar masses. The observed Hbeta luminosities are in good agreement with expectations from the estimated star-formation rates, and none of our sources are detected in deep X-ray stacks, ruling out significant contamination by active galactic nuclei. Combining our sample with a variety of LBGs from the literature, including 49 galaxies selected in a very similar manner, we find a high median ratio of [OIII]/Hbeta = 4.8+0.8-1.7. This high ratio seems to be an ubiquitous feature of z$\sim$3-4 LBGs, very different from typical local star-forming galaxies at similar stellar masses. The only comparable systems at z$\sim$0 are those with similarly high specific star-formation rates, though $\sim$5x lower stellar masses. High specific star-formation rates either result in a much higher ionization parameter or other unusual conditions for the interstellar medium, which result in a much higher [OIII]/Hbeta line ratio. This implies a strong relation between a global property of a galaxy, the specific star-formation rate, and the local conditions of ISM in star-forming regions.},

abstract = {{There is a long history of using optical emission and absorption lines to constrain the metallicity and ionization parameters of gas in galaxies. However, comparable diagnostics are less well-developed for the UV. Here,} we assess the diagnostic potential of both absorption and emission features in the UV and evaluate the diagnostics against observations of local and high redshift galaxies. We use the {\tt CloudyFSPS} nebular emission model of Byler+2017, extended to include emission predictions in the UV, to evaluate the metallicity sensitivity of established UV stellar absorption indices, and to identify those that include a significant contribution from nebular emission. We present model UV emission line fluxes as a function of metallicity and ionization parameter, assuming both instantaneous bursts and constant SFRs. We identify combinations of strong emission lines that constrain metallicity and ionization parameter, including [CIII]$\lambda1907$, CIII]$\lambda1909$, OIII]$\lambda1661,1666$, SiIII]$\lambda1883,1892$, CIV$\lambda$1548,1551, NII]$\lambda1750,1752$, and MgII$\lambda2796$, and develop UV versions of the canonical "BPT" diagram. We quantify the relative contribution from stellar wind emission and nebular line emission to diagnostic line ratios that include the CIV$\lambda$1548,1551 lines, and also develop an observationally motivated relationship for N and C enrichment that improves the performance of photoionization models. We summarize the best diagnostic choices and the associated redshift range for low-, mid-, and high-resolution rest-UV spectroscopy in preparation for the launch of JWST.},

abstract = {The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250 000 galaxies. This paper describes the survey design, the spectroscopic observations, the redshift measurements and the survey data base. The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multifibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2° diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than bJ = 19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 8O° × 15° around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75° × 10° along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000 deg2 and has a median depth of z̄ = 0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600-8000 {\AA} at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0 {\AA} and a median S/N of 13 pixel-1. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5; Q ≥ 3 redshifts are 98.4 per cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85 km s-1. The overall redshift completeness for Q ≥ 3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this varies with magnitude from 99 per cent for the brightest galaxies to 90 per cent for objects at the survey limit. The 2dFGRS data base is available on the World Wide Web at http://www. mso.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS.},

@article{Houghton2015,
abstract = {In light of recent findings from the kinematic morphology-density relation, we investigate whether the same trends exist in the original morphology density relation, using the same data as Dressler. In addition to Dressler's canonical relations, we find that further refinements are possible when considering the average local projected density of galaxies in a cluster. Firstly, the distribution of ellipticals in a cluster depends on the relative local density of galaxies in that cluster: equivalent rises in the elliptical fraction occur at higher local densities for clusters with higher average local densities. This is not true for the late-type fraction, where the variation with local density within a cluster is independent of the average local density of galaxies in that cluster, and is as Dressler originally found. Furthermore, the overall ratio of ellipticals to early-types in a cluster does not depend on the average density of galaxies in that cluster (unlike the ratio of lenticulars to disk systems), and is fixed at around 30%. In the paradigm of fast and slow rotators, we show that such an elliptical fraction in the early-type population is consistent with a slow rotator fraction of 15% in the early-type population, using the statistics of the ATLAS3D survey. We also find the scatter in the overall ratio of ellipticals to early-types is greatest for clusters with lower average densities, such that clusters with the highest elliptical fractions have the lowest average local densities. Finally, we show that average local projected density correlates well with global projected density, but the latter has difficulty in accurately characterising the density of irregular cluster morphologies.},

abstract = {We have used extensive libraries of model and empirical galaxy spectra [assembled, respectively, from the population synthesis code of Bruzual and Charlot and the fourth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)] to interpret some puzzling features seen in the spectra of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We show that a stellar He ii $\lambda$1640 emission line, produced in the expanding atmospheres of Of and Wolf-Rayet stars, should be detectable with an equivalent width of 0.5-1.5 {\AA} in the integrated spectra of star-forming galaxies, provided the metallicity is greater than about half solar. Our models reproduce the strength of the He ii $\lambda$1640 line measured in the spectra of Lyman-break galaxies for established values of their metallicities. With better empirical calibrations in local galaxies, this spectral feature has the potential of becoming a useful diagnostic of massive star winds at high, as well as low redshifts. We also uncover a relationship in SDSS galaxies between their location in the [O iii]/H$\beta$ versus [N ii]/H$\alpha$ diagnostic diagram (the BPT diagram) and their excess specific star formation rate relative to galaxies of similar mass. We infer that an elevated ionization parameter U is at the root of this effect, and propose that this is also the cause of the offset of high-redshift star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram compared to local ones. We further speculate that higher electron densities and escape fractions of hydrogen ionizing photons may be the factors responsible for the systematically higher values of U in the H ii regions of high-redshift galaxies. The impact of such differences on abundance determinations from strong nebular lines are considered and found to be relatively minor. {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

abstract = {We analyse scaling relations and evolution histories of galaxy sizes in TNG100, part of the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Observational qualitative trends of size with stellar mass, star formation rate and redshift are reproduced, and a quantitative comparison of projected r band sizes at 0 ≲ z ≲ 2 shows agreement to much better than 0.25 dex. We follow populations of z = 0 galaxies with a range of masses backwards in time along their main progenitor branches, distinguishing between main-sequence and quenched galaxies. Our main findings are as follows. (i) At M*, z = 0 ≳ 109.5 M⊙, the evolution of the median main progenitor differs, with quenched galaxies hardly growing in median size before quenching, whereas main-sequence galaxies grow their median size continuously, thus opening a gap from the progenitors of quenched galaxies. This is partly because the main-sequence high-redshift progenitors of quenched z = 0 galaxies are drawn from the lower end of the size distribution of the overall population of main-sequence high-redshift galaxies. (ii) Quenched galaxies with M*, M*, z = 0 ≳ 109.5 M⊙ experience a steep size growth on the size-mass plane after their quenching time, but with the exception of galaxies withM*, z = 0 ≳ 1011 M⊙, the size growth after quenching is small in absolute terms, such that most of the size (and mass) growth of quenched galaxies (and its variation among them) occurs while they are still on the main sequence. After they become quenched, the size growth rate of quenched galaxies as a function of time, as opposed to versus mass, is similar to that of main-sequence galaxies. Hence, the size gap is retained down to z = 0.},

abstract = {The overdense environments of protoclusters of galaxies in the early Universe (z > 2) are expected to accelerate the evolution of galaxies, with an increased rate of stellarmass assembly and black hole accretion compared to co-eval galaxies in the average density 'field'. These galaxies are destined to form the passive population ofmassive galaxies that dominate the cores of rich clusters today. While signatures of the accelerated growth of galaxies in the SSA22 protocluster (z = 3.1) have been observed, the mechanism driving this remains unclear. Here we showan enhanced rate of galaxy-galaxy mergers could be responsible.We morphologically classify Lyman-break Galaxies (LBGs) in the SSA22 protocluster and compare these to those of galaxies in the field at z = 3.1 as either active mergers or non-merging using Hubble Space Telescope ACS/F814W imaging, probing the rest-frame ultraviolet stellar light.We measure a merger fraction of 48 ± 10 per cent for LBGs in the protocluster compared to 30 ± 6 per cent in the field. Although the excess is marginal, an enhanced rate of mergers in SSA22 hints that galaxy-galaxy mergers are one of the key channels driving accelerated star formation and AGN growth in protocluster environments.},

abstract = {We present the new TNG50 cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulation - the third and final volume of the IllustrisTNG project. This simulation occupies a unique combination of large volume and high resolution, with a 50 Mpc box sampled by 21603 gas cells (baryon mass of 8 × 104 M☉). The median spatial resolution of star-forming interstellar medium gas is ∼100−140 pc. This resolution approaches or exceeds that of modern 'zoom' simulations of individual massive galaxies, while the volume contains ∼20 000 resolved galaxies with M* ≳ 107 M☉. Herein we show first results from TNG50, focusing on galactic outflows driven by supernovae as well as supermassive black hole feedback. We find that the outflow mass loading is a non-monotonic function of galaxy stellar mass, turning over and rising rapidly above 1010.5 M☉ due to the action of the central black hole (BH). The outflow velocity increases with stellar mass, and at fixed mass it is faster at higher redshift. The TNG model can produce high-velocity, multiphase outflows that include cool, dense components. These outflows reach speeds in excess of 3000 km s−1 out to 20 kpc with an ejective, BH-driven origin. Critically, we show how the relative simplicity of model inputs (and scalings) at the injection scale produces complex behaviour at galactic and halo scales. For example, despite isotropic wind launching, outflows exhibit natural collimation and an emergent bipolarity. Furthermore, galaxies above the star-forming main sequence drive faster outflows, although this correlation inverts at high mass with the onset of quenching, whereby low-luminosity, slowly accreting, massive BHs drive the strongest outflows.},

abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year WMAP data, in conjunction with additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter LCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l CMB anisotropy, the BAO scale, and the Hubble constant, the densities, Omegabh2, Omegach2, and Omega{\_}L, are each determined to a precision of {\$\sim${}}1.5{\%}. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3{\%}, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional LCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their LCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r{\textless}0.13 (95{\%} CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038); the summed mass of neutrinos is {\textless}0.44 eV (95{\%} CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to be 3.84+/-0.40 when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on Neff and the primordial helium abundance agrees with the prediction of standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent PLANCK measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

abstract = {We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate how the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of massive galaxies (M∗ > 1010 M≥) depend on the distance to their closest companions. We estimate sSFR enhancements by comparing with control samples that are matched in redshift, stellar mass, local density, and isolation, and we restrict our analysis to pairs with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 to 10. At small separations (∼15 kpc), the mean sSFR is enhanced by a factor of 2.0 ± 0.1 in the flagship (110.7 Mpc)3 simulation (TNG100-1). Statistically significant enhancements extend out to 3D separations of 280 kpc in the (302.6 Mpc)3 simulation (TNG300-1). We find similar trends in the EAGLE and Illustris simulations, although their sSFR enhancements are lower than those in TNG100-1 by about a factor of two. Enhancements in IllustrisTNG galaxies are seen throughout the redshift range explored (0 ≤ z < 1), with the strength of the enhancements decreasing with increasing redshift for galaxies with close companions. In order to more closely compare with observational results, we separately consider 2D projected distances between galaxies in IllustrisTNG. We detect significant sSFR enhancements out to projected separations of 260 kpc in TNG300-1, with projection effects diluting the size of the enhancements by about 20 per cent below 50 kpc. We find similar sSFR enhancements in TNG100-1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, with enhancements extending out to projected separations of about 150 kpc for star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. Finally, by summing over all separations, we estimate that the presence of closest companions boosts the average sSFR of massive galaxies in TNG100-1 by 14.5 per cent.},

abstract = {Galaxies represent one of the preferred candidate sources to drive the reionization of the universe. Even as gains are made in mapping the galaxy UV luminosity density to z>6, significant uncertainties remain regarding the conversion to the implied ionizing emissivity. The relevant unknowns are the Lyman-continuum (LyC) photon production efficiency xi_{ion} and the escape fraction f_{esc}. As we show here, the first of these unknowns is directly measureable in z=4-5 galaxies, based on the impact the Halpha line has on the observed IRAC fluxes. By computing a LyC photon production rate from the implied Halpha luminosities for a broad selection of z=4-5 galaxies and comparing this against the dust-corrected UV-continuum luminosities, we provide the first-ever direct estimates of the LyC photon production efficiency xi_{ion} for the z>$\sim$4 galaxy population. We find log_{10} xi_{ion}/[Hz/ergs] to have a mean value of 25.27_{-0.03}^{+0.03} and 25.34_{-0.02}^{+0.02} for sub-L* z=4-5 galaxies adopting Calzetti and SMC dust laws, respectively. Reassuringly, both values are consistent with standardly assumed xi_{ion}'s in reionization models, with a slight preference for higher xi_{ion}'s (by $\sim$0.1 dex) adopting the SMC dust law. A modest $\sim$0.03-dex increase in these estimates would result if the escape fraction for ionizing photons is non-zero and galaxies dominate the ionizing emissivity at z$\sim$4.4. High values of xi_{ion} ($\sim$25.5-25.8 dex) are derived for the bluest galaxies (beta<-2.3) in our samples, independent of dust law and consistent with results for a z=7.045 galaxy. Such elevated values of xi_{ion} would have important consequences, indicating that f_{esc} cannot be in excess of 13% unless the galaxy UV luminosity function does not extend down to -13 mag or the clumping factor is greater than 3. A low escape fraction would fit well with the low rate of LyC leakage observed at z$\sim$3.},

abstract = {Galaxy formation is at the heart of our understanding of cosmic evolution. Although there is a consensus that galaxies emerged from the expanding matter background by gravitational instability of primordial fluctuations, a number of additional physical processes must be understood and implemented in theoretical models before these can be reliably used to interpret observations. In parallel, the astonishing recent progresses made in detecting galaxies that formed only a few hundreds of million years after the Big Bang is pushing the quest for more sophisticated and detailed studies of early structures. In this review, we combine the information gleaned from different theoretical models/studies to build a coherent picture of the Universe in its early stages which includes the physics of galaxy formation along with the impact that early structures had on large-scale processes as cosmic reionization and metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium.},

abstract = {We present catalogues of stellar masses, star formation rates, and ancillary stellar population parameters for galaxies spanning $0<z<9$ from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). DEVILS is a deep spectroscopic redshift survey with very high completeness, covering several premier deep fields including COSMOS (D10). Our stellar mass and star formation rate estimates are self-consistently derived using the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling code ProSpect, using well-motivated parameterisations for dust attenuation, star formation histories, and metallicity evolution. We show how these improvements, and especially our physically motivated assumptions about metallicity evolution, have an appreciable systematic effect on the inferred stellar masses, at the level of $\backslashsim{\$}0.2 dex. To illustrate the scientific value of these data, we map the evolving galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) for $0<z<5$ and the SFR-$M_\backslashstar{\$} relation for $0<z<9$. In agreement with past studies, we find that most of the evolution in the SMF is driven by the characteristic density parameter, with little evolution in the characteristic mass and low-mass slopes. Where the SFR-$M_\backslashstar{\$} relation is indistinguishable from a power-law at $z>2.6$, we see evidence of a bend in the relation at low redshifts ($z<0.45$). This suggests evolution in both the normalisation and shape of the SFR-$M_\backslashstar{\$} relation since cosmic noon. It is significant that we only clearly see this bend when combining our new DEVILS measurements with consistently derived values for lower redshift galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey: this shows the power of having consistent treatment for galaxies at all redshifts.},

abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11663 deg{\^{}}2 of imaging data, with most of the roughly 2000 deg{\^{}}2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry over 250 deg{\^{}}2 along the Celestial Equator in the Southern Galactic Cap. A coaddition of these data goes roughly two magnitudes fainter than the main survey. The spectroscopy is now complete over a contiguous area of 7500 deg{\^{}}2 in the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC-2), reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milli-arcseconds per coordinate. A systematic error in bright galaxy photometr is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat-fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the specific star formation rate-stellar mass (sSFR-M*) of z ≤ 0.13 disc central galaxies using a morphologically selected mass-complete sample (M* ≥ 109.5M⊙). Considering samples of grouped and ungrouped galaxies, we find the sSFR-M* relations of disc-dominated central galaxies to have no detectable dependence on host dark-matter halo (DMH) mass, even where weak-lensing measurements indicate a difference in halo mass of a factor ≳ 5.We further detect a gradual evolution of the sSFR-M* relation of non-grouped (field) central disc galaxies with redshift, even over a $\Delta$z ≈ 0.04 (≈5 × 108 yr) interval, while the scatter remains constant. This evolution is consistent with extrapolation of the 'main sequence of star-forming-galaxies' from previous literature that uses larger redshift baselines and coarser sampling. Taken together, our results present new constraints on the paradigm under which the SFR of galaxies is determined by a self-regulated balance between gas inflows and outflows, and consumption of gas by star formation in discs, with the inflow being determined by the product of the cosmological accretion rate and a fuelling efficiency - -Mb,halo$\zeta$. In particular, maintaining the paradigm requires -Mb,halo$\zeta$ to be independent of themass Mhalo of the host DMH. Furthermore, it requires the fuelling efficiency $\zeta$ to have a strong redshift dependence (∝(1 + z)2.7 forM* = 1010.3M⊙ over z = 0-0.13), even though no morphological transformation to spheroids can be invoked to explain this in our disc-dominated sample. The physical mechanisms capable of giving rise to such dependencies of $\zeta$ on Mhalo and z for discs are unclear.},

abstract = {We present a new-generation tool to model and interpret spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies, which incorporates in a consistent way the production of radiation and its transfer through the interstellar and intergalactic media. This flexible tool, named BEAGLE (for BayEsian Analysis of GaLaxy sEds), allows one to build mock galaxy catalogues as well as to interpret any combination of photometric and spectroscopic galaxy observations in terms of physical parameters. The current version of the tool includes versatile modelling of the emission from stars and photoionized gas, attenuation by dust and accounting for different instrumental effects, such as spectroscopic flux calibration and line spread function. We show a first application of the BEAGLE tool to the interpretation of broad-band SEDs of a published sample of $\sim$104 galaxies at redshifts 0.1 ≲ z ≲ 8.We find that the constraints derived on photometric redshifts using this multipurpose tool are comparable to those obtained using public, dedicated photometricredshift codes and quantify this result in a rigorous statistical way. We also show how the post-processing of BEAGLE output data with the PYTHON extension PYP-BEAGLE allows the characterization of systematic deviations between models and observations, in particular through posterior predictive checks. The modular design of the BEAGLE tool allows easy extensions to incorporate, for example, the absorption by neutral galactic and circumgalactic gas, and the emission from an active galactic nucleus, dust and shock-ionized gas. Information about public releases of the BEAGLE tool will be maintained on http://www.jacopochevallard.org/beagle.},

abstract = {Observations of high-redshift galaxies have revealed a multitude of large clumpy rapidly star-forming galaxies. Their formation scenario and their link to present-day spirals are still unknown. In this Letter, we perform adaptive mesh refinement simulations of disc formation in a cosmological context that are unrivalled in terms of mass and spatial resolution. We find that the so-called 'chain-galaxies' and 'clump-clusters' are a natural outcome of early epochs of enhanced gas accretion from cold dense streams as well as tidally and ram-pressured stripped material from minor mergers and satellites. Through interaction with the hot halo gas, this freshly accreted cold gas settles into a large disc-like system, not necessarily aligned to an older stellar component, that undergoes fragmentation and subsequent star formation, forming large clumps in the mass range 107-109 M⊙. Galaxy formation is a complex process at this important epoch when most of the central baryons are being acquired through a range of different mechanisms - we highlight that a rapid mass loading epoch is required to fuel the fragmentation taking place in the massive arms in the outskirts of extended discs, an accretion mode that occurs naturally in the hierarchical assembly process at early epochs. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

The maps reveal filamentary large-scale structures and two remarkable overdensities made out of at least 44 and 12 galaxies at $z=5.692$ (z57OD) and $z=6.585$ (z66OD), respectively, making z66OD the most distant overdensity spectroscopically confirmed to date with $>10$ spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. We compare spatial distributions of submillimeter galaxies at $z\simeq 4-6$ with our $z=5.7$ galaxies forming the large-scale structures, and detect a $99.97\%$ signal of cross correlation, indicative of a clear coincidence of dusty star-forming galaxy and dust unobscured galaxy formation at this early epoch. The galaxies in z57OD and z66OD are actively forming stars with star formation rates (SFRs) $\gtrsim5$ times higher than the main sequence, and particularly the SFR density in z57OD is 10 times higher than the cosmic average at the redshift (a.k.a. the Madau-Lilly plot). Comparisons with numerical simulations suggest that z57OD and z66OD are protoclusters that are progenitors of the present-day clusters with halo masses of $\sim10^{14}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$.},

abstract = {The origin of the correlations between mass, morphology, quenched fraction, and formation history in galaxies is difficult to define, primarily due to the uncertainties in galaxy star-formation histories. Star-formation histories are better constrained for higher redshift galaxies, observed closer to their formation and quenching epochs. Here we use "non-parametric" star-formation histories and a nested sampling method to derive constraints on the formation and quenching timescales of quiescent galaxies at 0.7 < z < 2.5. We model deep HST grism spectroscopy and photometry from the CLEAR (CANDELS Lyman-$\alpha$ Emission at Reionization) survey. The galaxy formation redshifts, z50 (defined as the point where they had formed 50% of their stellar mass) range from z50 ∼ 2 (shortly prior to the observed epoch) up to z50 ≲ 5-8. We find that early formation redshifts are correlated with high stellar-mass surface densities, log$\Sigma$1=(Mo kpc-2) >10.25, where $\Sigma$1 is the stellar mass within 1 pkpc (proper kpc). Quiescent galaxies with the highest stellar-mass surface density, log$\Sigma$1=(Mo kpc-2) > 10.25, show a minimum formation redshift. all such objects in our sample have z50 > 2.9. Quiescent galaxies with lower surface density, log$\Sigma$1=(Mo kpc-2) = 9.5-10.25, show a range of formation epochs (z50 ' 1.5-8), implying these galaxies experienced a range of formation and assembly histories. We argue that the surface density threshold log$\Sigma$1=(Mo kpc-2) > 10.25 uniquely identifies galaxies that formed in the first few Gyr after the Big Bang, and we discuss the implications this has for galaxy formation models.},

abstract = {Aims. We investigate whether the mean star formation activity of star-forming galaxies from to in the GOODS-S field can be reproduced by simple evolution models of these systems. In this case, such models might be used as first-order references for studies at higher to decipher when and to what extent a secular evolution is sufficient to explain the star formation history in galaxies.Methods. We selected star-forming galaxies at and at in IR and in UV to have access to all the recent star formation. We focused on galaxies with a stellar mass ranging between and for which the results are not biased by the selections. We compared the data to chemical evolution models developed for spiral galaxies and originally built to reproduce the main characteristics of the Milky Way and nearby spirals without fine-tuning them for the present analysis.Results. We find a shallow decrease in the specific star formation rate (SSFR) when the stellar mass increases. The evolution of the SSFR characterizing both UV and IR selected galaxies from to is consistent with the models built to reproduce the present spiral galaxies. There is no need to strongly modify of the physical conditions in galaxies to explain the average evolution of their star formation from to . We use the models to predict the evolution of the star formation rate and the metallicity on a wider range of redshift and we compare these predictions with the results of semi-analytical models. {\textcopyright} 2008 ESO.},

abstract = {We present Keck/OSIRIS laser guide-star assisted adaptive optics (LGSAO) integral field spectroscopy of [O III] 5007 Angstrom nebular emission from twelve galaxies hosting optically faint (R = 20 - 25; nuLnu {\$\sim${}} 10{\^{}}44 -10{\^{}}46 erg/s) active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshift z {\$\sim${}} 2 - 3. In combination with deep Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 rest-frame optical imaging, Keck/MOSFIRE rest-optical spectroscopy, and Keck/KCWI rest-UV integral field spectroscopy we demonstrate that both the continuum and emission-line structure of these sources exhibit a wide range of morphologies from compact isolated point sources to double-AGN merging systems with extensive {\$\sim${}} 50 kpc tidal tails. One of the twelve galaxies previously known to exhibit a proximate damped LyA system coincident in redshift with the galaxy shows evidence for both an extended [O III] narrow-line emission region and spatially offset LyA emission (with morphologically distinct blueshifted and redshifted components) indicative of large scale gas flows photoionized by the central AGN. We do not find widespread evidence of star formation in the host galaxies surrounding these AGN; the [O III] velocity dispersions tend to be high (sigma = 100 - 500 km/s), the continuum morphologies are much more compact than a mass-matched star forming comparison sample, and the diagnostic nebular emission line ratios are dominated by an AGN-like ionizing spectrum. The sample is most consistent with a population of AGN that radiate at approximately their Eddington limit and photoionize extended [O III] nebulae whose characteristic sizes scale approximately as the square root of the AGN luminosity.},

@article{Zehavi2012,
abstract = {We study the evolution of stellar mass in galaxies as a function of host halo mass, using the "MPA" and "Durham" semi-analytic models, implemented on the Millennium Run simulation. For both models, the stellar mass of the central galaxies increases rapidly with halo mass at the low-mass end and more slowly in halos of larger masses at the three redshifts probed (z ∼ 0, 1, 2). About 45{\%} of the stellar mass in central galaxies in present-day halos less massive than 1012h-1 M ⊙ is already in place at z ∼ 1, and this fraction increases to 65{\%} for more massive halos. The baryon conversion efficiency into stars has a peaked distribution with halo mass, and the peak location shifts toward lower mass from z ∼ 1 to z ∼ 0. The stellar mass in low-mass halos grows mostly by star formation since z ∼ 1, while in high-mass halos most of the stellar mass is assembled by mergers, reminiscent of "downsizing." We compare our findings to empirical results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and DEEP2 surveys utilizing galaxy clustering measurements to study galaxy evolution. The theoretical predictions are in qualitative agreement with these phenomenological results, but there are large discrepancies. The most significant one concerns the number of stars already in place in the progenitor galaxies at z ∼ 1, which is about a factor of two larger in both semi-analytic models. We demonstrate that methods studying galaxy evolution from the galaxy-halo connection are powerful in constraining theoretical models and can guide future efforts of modeling galaxy evolution. Conversely, semi-analytic models serve an important role in improving such methods. {\textcopyright}2012 The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

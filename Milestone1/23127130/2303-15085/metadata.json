    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the dynamic response of a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG)/ Gd$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (GdIG)/ Pt trilayer system by measurements of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and the pumped spin current detected by the inverse spin Hall effect. This trilayer system offers the unique opportunity to investigate the spin dynamics of the ferrimagnetic GdIG, close to its compensation temperature. We show that our trilayer acts as a highly tunable spin current source. Our experimental results are supported by micro-magnetic simulations. As the detected spin current in the top Pt layer is distinctly dominated by the GdIG layer, this gives the unique opportunity to investigate the excitation and dynamic properties of GdIG while comparing it to the broadband FMR absorption spectrum of the heterostructure.",

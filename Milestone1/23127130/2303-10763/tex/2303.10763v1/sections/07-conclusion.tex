\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we collected \dataset~\cite{dataset}, the first dataset of source code plagiarism consisting specifically of solutions to competitive programming contest tasks, and used this dataset to compare the existing plagiarism detection tools. The manually labeled dataset contains 251 pairs of plagiarized solutions and 660 pairs of non-plagiarized ones, and comes in two versions: ``raw'', as well as with removed templates.
The comparison of the existing tools for detecting software plagiarism showed that token-based tools demonstrate the best results, and that the presence of templates hinders the performance of all the tools.

\section{Limitations \& Future Work}
\label{sec:ttv}

\subsubsection{Language} Our dataset is based on the Java language, even though it is not the most prominent one in competitive programming. The choice of the language was dictated by the fact that it is the only one supported by all the prominent tools for detecting source code plagiarism. Future techniques, developed specifically for programming contests, may target more programming languages, such as C++. Our dataset cannot claim generalizability, however, the described approach can be used to collect similar datasets for other languages.

\subsubsection{Labeling} The labeling of the dataset was carried out by the first author of the paper and cannot be perfect. The author has a lot of experience with competitive programming, and we used several rounds of labeling to mitigate possible biases. At the same time, we view \dataset as the first step towards a fully fledged benchmark, and consider broadening it in the future as the main next step. For this reason, our major future plan is to conduct an extensive labeling with multiple experts.

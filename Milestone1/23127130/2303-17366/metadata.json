    "abstract": "The synthesis of quantum circuits from phase gadgets in the ZX-calculus facilitates quantum circuit optimization. Our work provides an alternative formulation for the architecture-aware synthesis algorithm of PauliOpt by replacing the stochastic approach of PauliOpt with a heuristic based search and utilizes a divide and conquer method to synthesize an optimized circuit from a ZX polynomial. We provide a comparison of our algorithm with PauliOpt and other state-of-the-art optimization libraries. While we note poorer performance for highly structured circuits, as in the QAOA formulation for Max-Cut, we demonstrate a significant advantage for randomized circuits, which highlights the advantages of utilizing an architecture-aware methodology.",

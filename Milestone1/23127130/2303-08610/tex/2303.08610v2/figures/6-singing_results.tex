    While our model successfully predicted that the input is processed with a  {\texttt{{[pingpong\_delay]}}} and two parallel {\texttt{[pitchshift]}} modules (each with panning modulation), it failed to estimate their correct order.

    Our model failed to decode the {\texttt{[bell]}} and {\texttt{[lowshelf]}}. This is not surprising, because if {\texttt{bit}} parameter of the {\texttt{[bitcrush]}} is set to very low value, it destroys the signal and eventually makes estimation of the processors applied before the {\texttt{[bitcrush]}} challenging.

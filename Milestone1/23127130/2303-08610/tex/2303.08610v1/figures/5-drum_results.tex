        \caption{An inference result from the proposed method \ding{194} on the drum mixing estimation task (left: ground-truth, right: prediction). 
        First, our model correctly predicted the source instrument types: \texttt{[kick]}, \texttt{[snare]}, \texttt{[hat]}, and \texttt{[ride]}. The ground-truth graph panned \texttt{[kick]} and \texttt{[ride]}, which is also reconstructed by the prediction. However, the prediction failed to estimate (i) the correct multi-band processing of \texttt{[reverb]}, (ii) multiple stages of \texttt{[distortion]} processors, and (iii) modulation of linear filters in the mixing subgraph.

    "abstract": "The surprising JWST discovery of a quiescent, low-mass ($M_\\star=10^{8.7} \\rm M_\\odot$) galaxy at redshift $z=7.3$ (JADES-GS-z7-01-QU) represents a unique opportunity to study the imprint of feedback processes on early galaxy evolution. We build a sample of 130 low-mass ($M_\\star\\lesssim 10^{9.5} \\rm M_\\odot$) galaxies from the SERRA cosmological zoom-in simulations, which show a feedback-regulated, bursty star formation history (SFH). The fraction of time spent in an active phase increases with the stellar mass from $f_{duty}\\approx 0.6$ at $M_\\star\\approx 10^{7.5} \\rm M_\\odot$ to $\\approx 0.99$ at $M_\\star\\geq 10^{9} \\rm M_\\odot$, and it is in agreement with the value $f_{duty}\\approx 0.75$ estimated for JADES-GS-z7-01-QU. On average, 30% of the galaxies are quiescent in the range $6 < z < 8.4$; they become the dominant population at $M_\\star\\lesssim 10^{8.3} \\rm M_\\odot$. However, none of these quiescent systems matches the Spectral Energy Distribution of JADES-GS-z7-01-QU, unless their SFH is artificially truncated a few Myr after the main star formation peak. As supernova feedback can only act on a longer timescale ($\\gtrsim 30 \\rm \\, Myr$), this implies that the observed abrupt quenching must be caused by a faster physical mechanism, such as radiation-driven winds.",

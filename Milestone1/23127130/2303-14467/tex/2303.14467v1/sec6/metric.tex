\subsection{Metric spaces}\label{subsec:metricscpaces}

A metric space is a pair $(X, d)$, where $X$ is a set and $d: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function called a metric, that assigns a non-negative real number, denoted $d(x,y)$, to any two elements $x, y \in X$, satisfying the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $d(x, y) = 0 \text{ if and only if } x = y$ (identity)
    \item $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ (symmetry)
    \item $d(x, y) + d(y, z) \geq d(x, z)$ (triangle inequality)
\end{enumerate}

It is natural therefore to define a weighted graph in a metric space, where the vertices are the points of the space, and each pair of point is connected by an edge, weighted according to the distance function $d(\cdot)$. Note that the resulting graph would be complete, thus the need of methods for sparsifying it becomes urgent.

Esfandiari and Mitzenmacher \cite{esfandiari2018metric} designed a novel sampling approach for the edges of a graph defined in a metric space, using a sublinear number of queries, succeeding with probability at least $1-\bigO(\frac{1}{n})$.
Such result implies that for DSP in $\lambda$-metric graphs\footnote{A $\lambda$-metric graphs is a graph defined in a metric space for which the triangle inequality that holds is $d(x, y) + d(y, z) \geq \lambda d(x, z)$.}, they can provide a $2+\epsilon$-approximation algorithm requiring $\tilde{\bigO}(\frac{n}{\lambda \epsilon^2})$ time.

\subsection{Metric spaces}\label{subsec:metricscpaces}
A metric space is a pair $(X, d)$, where $X$ is a set and $d: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ is a function called a metric, that assigns a non-negative real number, denoted by $d(x,y)$, to any two elements $x, y \in X$, satisfying the following properties:
$d(x, y) = 0 \text{ if and only if } x = y$ (identity), $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ (symmetry), and $d(x, y) + d(y, z) \geq d(x, z)$ (triangle inequality). We can define a weighted graph in a metric space, where the vertices are the points of the space, and each pair of point is connected by an edge, weighted according to the distance function $d$. As the resulting graph would be complete, sparsification might be needed.
Esfandiari and Mitzenmacher \cite{esfandiari2018metric} designed a novel sampling approach for the edges of a graph defined in a metric space, using a sublinear number of queries, succeeding with probability at least $1-\bigO(1/n)$.
\rev{This} result implies that for DSP in $\lambda$-metric graphs\footnote{In a $\lambda$-metric graph the triangle inequality that holds is $d(x, y) + d(y, z) \geq \lambda d(x, z)$.}, they can provide a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm requiring $\tilde{\bigO}(n / (\lambda \epsilon^2))$ time.

This paper presents an approach to solving POMDPs that represents a policy explicitly as a finite-state controller and iteratively improves the controller by search in policy space. Two related algorithms illustrate this approach. The first is a policy iteration algorithm that can outperform value iteration in solving infinitehorizon POMDPs. It provides the foundation for a new heuristic search algorithm that promises further speedup by focusing computational effort on regions of the problem space that are reachable, or likely to be reached, from a start state.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence}, pages = {211–219}, numpages = {9}, location = {Madison, Wisconsin}, series = {UAI'98} }

  abstract =   {Robots equipped with rich sensing modalities (e.g., RGB-D cameras) performing long-horizon tasks motivate the need for policies that are highly memory-efficient. State-of-the-art approaches for controlling robots often use memory representations that are excessively rich for the task or rely on handcrafted tricks for memory efficiency. Instead, this work provides a general approach for jointly synthesizing memory representations and policies; the resulting policies actively seek to reduce memory requirements. Specifically, we present a reinforcement learning framework that leverages an implementation of the group LASSO regularization to synthesize policies that employ low-dimensional and task-centric memory representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with simulated examples including navigation in discrete and continuous spaces as well as vision-based indoor navigation set in a photo-realistic simulator. The results on these examples indicate that our method is capable of finding policies that rely only on low-dimensional memory representations, improving generalization, and actively reducing memory requirements.}

    abstract = { One of the most difficult challenges in robot motion planning is to account for the behavior of other moving agents, such as humans. Commonly, practitioners employ predictive models to reason about where other agents are going to move. Though there has been much recent work in building predictive models, no model is ever perfect: an agent can always move unexpectedly, in a way that is not predicted or not assigned sufficient probability. In such cases, the robot may plan trajectories that appear safe but, in fact, lead to collision. Rather than trust a model’s predictions blindly, we propose that the robot should use the model’s current predictive accuracy to inform the degree of confidence in its future predictions. This model confidence inference allows us to generate probabilistic motion predictions that exploit modeled structure when the structure successfully explains human motion, and degrade gracefully whenever the human moves unexpectedly. We accomplish this by maintaining a Bayesian belief over a single parameter that governs the variance of our human motion model. We couple this prediction algorithm with a recently proposed robust motion planner and controller to guide the construction of robot trajectories that are, to a good approximation, collision-free with a high, user-specified probability. We provide extensive analysis of the combined approach and its overall safety properties by establishing a connection to reachability analysis, and conclude with a hardware demonstration in which a small quadcopter operates safely in the same space as a human pedestrian. }

There are efficient linear-time algorithms that compute the decomposition for undirected graphs. The best previously published time bound for directed graphs is O(n+mlogn), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges. We give an O(n+m)-time algorithm.}

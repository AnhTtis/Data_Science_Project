    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a planning problem for a large-scale system modelled as a hierarchical finite state machine (HFSM) and develop a control algorithm for computing optimal plans between any two states. The control algorithm consists of two steps: a preprocessing step computing optimal exit costs for each machine in the HFSM, with time complexity scaling linearly with the number of machines, and a query step that rapidly computes optimal plans, truncating irrelevant parts of the HFSM using the optimal exit costs, with time complexity scaling near-linearly with the depth of the HFSM. The control algorithm is reconfigurable in the sense that a change in the HFSM is efficiently handled, updating only needed parts in the preprocessing step to account for the change, with time complexity linear in the depth of the HFSM. We validate our algorithm on a robotic application, comparing with Dijkstra's algorithm and Contraction Hierarchies. Our algorithm outperforms both.",

\begin{abstract}
%Continual learning (CL) aims to develop algorithms that can adapt the model parameters to a series of tasks from non-stationary data distributions.
In Continual learning (CL) balancing effective adaptation while combating catastrophic forgetting is a central challenge. Many of the recent best-performing methods utilize various forms of prior task data, \textit{e.g.} a replay buffer, to tackle the catastrophic forgetting problem. Having access to previous task data can be restrictive in many real-world scenarios, for example when task data is sensitive or proprietary. To overcome the necessity of using previous tasks data, in this work, we start with strong representation learning methods that have been shown to be less prone to forgetting. We propose a holistic approach to jointly learn the representation and class prototypes while maintaining the relevance of old class prototypes and their embedded similarities.
Specifically, samples are mapped to an embedding space where the representations are learned using a supervised contrastive loss. Class prototypes are evolved continually in the same latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point. To continually adapt the prototypes without keeping any prior task data, we propose a novel distillation loss that constrains class prototypes to maintain relative similarities as compared to new task data. This method yields state-of-the-art performance in the task-incremental setting where we are able to outperform other methods that both use no data as well as approaches relying on large amounts of data. Our method is also shown to provide strong performance in the class-incremental setting without using any stored data points.
% In this work, we focus on tackling this problem by combining a supervised representation learning objective, that naturally maintains strong separation between representations of different classes, with an approach for stabilizing the relative position of old class prototypes used to make final class-level predictions. Specifically, samples are mapped to an embedding space where the representations are learned using a supervised contrastive loss. Class prototypes are evolved continually in the same latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point. To continually adapt the prototypes without keeping any prior task data, we propose a novel distillation loss that constrains class prototypes to maintain relative similarities as compared to new task data. This method yields state-of-the-art performance in the task-incremental setting where we are able to outperform (in many cases by a wide margin) other methods that both use no data as well as approaches relying on large amounts of data. Our method is also shown to provide strong performance in the class-incremental setting without using any stored data points.

\vspace{-5pt}\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}\vspace{-5pt}
We proposed a novel approach for Replay-Free Continual learning that effectively leverages relationship distillation alongside supervised contrastive learning. On a wide array of evaluations, our method is shown to provide good trade-offs in stability and plasticity, leading to large improvements over replay-free baselines and allows us to exceed performance of replay-based methods.
Moreover, we showed that our method can effectively utilize additional replay samples, outperforming the state-of-the-art replay-based methods in the class-incremental setting.
These observations open up potential new directions for approaches in replay-free continual learning.

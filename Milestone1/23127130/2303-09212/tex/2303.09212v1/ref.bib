However, segmenting the airways of the human lung is notoriously diﬃcult. This is due to the small size of the participating anatomical structures, which are moreover subject to partial volume and noise eﬀects. Limited intensity contrasts between air and lung parenchyma also complicate segmentation. In this paper, we present our hybrid segmentation method consisting of three main steps, which are iterated until a satisfactory result is achieved. User interaction is limited to the speciﬁcation of a seed point inside the easily detectable trachea. Further, we discuss the performance of our method within the EXACT09 challenge, where 20 test datasets with varying quality and pathologies had to be processed.},

	abstract = {Detailed pulmonary airway segmentation is a clinically important task for endobronchial intervention and treatment of peripheral located lung cancer lesions. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are promising tools for medical image analysis but have been performing poorly for cases when existing a signiﬁcant imbalanced feature distribution, which is true for the airway data as the trachea and principal bronchi dominate most of the voxels whereas the lobar bronchi and distal segmental bronchi occupy a small proportion. In this paper, we propose a Diﬀerentiable Topology-Preserved Distance Transform (DTPDT) framework to improve the performance of airway segmentation. A Topology-Preserved Surrogate (TPS) learning strategy is ﬁrst proposed to balance the training progress within-class distribution. Furthermore, a Convolutional Distance Transform (CDT) is designed to identify the breakage phenomenon with superior sensitivity and minimize the variation of the distance map between the prediction and ground-truth. The proposed method is validated with the publically available reference airway segmentation datasets. The detected rate of branch and length on public EXACT’09 and BAS datasets are 82.1\%/79.6\% and 96.5\%/91.5\% respectively, demonstrating the reliability and eﬃciency of the method in terms of improving the topology completeness of the segmentation performance while maintaining the overall topology accuracy.},

	shorttitle = {Break},
	abstract = {Airway segmentation is critical for virtual bronchoscopy and computer-aided pulmonary disease analysis. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to delineate the bronchial tree. However, the segmentation results of the CNN-based methods usually include many discontinuous branches, which need manual repair in clinical use. A major reason for the breakages is that the appearance of the airway wall can be affected by the lung disease as well as the adjacency of the vessels, while the network tends to overﬁt these special patterns in the training set. To learn robust features for these areas, we design a multi-stage framework that adopts the geodesic distance transform to capture the intensity changes between airway lumen and wall. Another reason for the breakages is the intra-class imbalance. Since the volume of the peripheral bronchi may be much smaller than the large branches in an input patch, the common segmentation loss is not sensitive to the breakages among the distal branches. Therefore, in this paper, a breakage-sensitive regularization term is designed and can be easily combined with other loss functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on publicly available datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our framework can detect more branches while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.},

	abstract = {As 3D navigated bronchoscopy is increasingly used for the biopsy and treatment of peripherally located lung cancer lesions, accurate segmentation of distal small airways plays an important role in both preand intra-operative navigation. When adopting CNN-based methods in this task, the gradients to these peripheral branches may disappear before arriving at the bottom layers. Firstly, this is closely related to the ratio of the foreground gradient to the background gradient. Generally, small ratios can lead to the erosion of the surface while the consequence is more serious for the distal small airways. To accurately segment the branches of diﬀerent sizes, we propose a local-imbalance-based weight that adjusts the gradient ratios according to the quantiﬁcation of local class imbalance. In addition, if the features of some under-represented areas are not learned in the ﬁrst few epochs, the gradients to these regions may be ﬁltered out by the last activation layer in the following training. To resolve this problem, we propose in this paper a BP-based weight enhancement strategy that restarts the training with reﬁned weight maps. The largest connected domain in our results achieves a tree length detected rate of 95\% with a precision of 92\% in the Binary Airway Segmentation Dataset.

In view of the intricate pattern of tree-like airways, the segmentation model should pay extra attention to the morphology and distribution characteristics of airways. We propose a CNNs-based airway segmentation method that enjoys superior sensitivity to tenuous peripheral bronchioles. We ﬁrst present a feature recalibration module to make the best use of learned features. Spatial information of features is properly integrated to retain relative priority of activated regions, which beneﬁts the subsequent channel-wise recalibration. Then, attention distillation module is introduced to reinforce the airway-speciﬁc representation learning. High-resolution attention maps with ﬁne airway details are passing down from late layers to previous layers iteratively to enrich context knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate considerable performance gain brought by the two proposed modules. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method extracted much more branches while maintaining competitive overall segmentation performance.},

	abstract = {Navigation bronchoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which doctors pass a bronchoscope into a subject’s airways to sample the target pulmonary lesion. A three-dimensional (3D) airway roadmap reconstructed from Computer Tomography (CT) scans is a prerequisite for this procedure, especially when the target is distally located. Therefore, an accurate and efﬁcient airway segmentation algorithm is essential to reduce bronchoscopists’ burden of pre-procedural airway identiﬁcation as well as patients’ discomfort during the prolonged procedure. However, airway segmentation remains a challenging task because of the intrinsic complex tree-like structure, imbalanced sizes of airway branches, potential domain shifts of CT scans, and few available labeled images. To address these problems, we present a deep learning-based pipeline, denoted as NaviAirway, which ﬁnds ﬁner bronchioles through four major novel components – feature extractor modules in model architecture design, a bronchiolesensitive loss function, a human-vision-inspired iterative training strategy, and a semi-supervised learning framework to utilize unlabeled CT images. Experimental results showed that NaviAirway outperformed existing methods, particularly in identiﬁcation of higher generation bronchioles and robustness to new CT scans. On average, NaviAirway takes ﬁve minutes to segment the CT scans of one patient on a GPU-embedded computer. Moreover, we propose two new metrics to complement conventional ones for a more comprehensive and fairer evaluation of deep learningbased airway segmentation approaches.

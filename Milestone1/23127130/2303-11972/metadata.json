    "abstract": "We present an improved post quantum version of Sakalauskas matrix power function key agreement protocol, using rectangular matrices instead of the original square ones. Sakalauskas matrix power function is an efficient and secure way to generate a shared secret key, and using rectangular matrices provides additional flexibility and security. This method reduces the computational burden by allowing smaller random integer matrices while maintaining equal security. Another advantage of using the rank deficient rectangular matrices over key agreement protocols is that it blocks linearization attacks.",

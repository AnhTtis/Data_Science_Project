An aspect of symbolic representations of music, which differentiates them from audio representations, is their suitability to be linked with notions from music theory that have been developed over the centuries. One core such notion is that of functional harmony, which involves analyzing progressions of chords. This paper proposes a description of the theory of functional harmony within the OWL 2 RL profile and experimentally demonstrates its practical use.}

    abstract = {A visual preference procedure was used to examine 6- and 4½-month-old infants' sensitivity to phrase structure in music. Sections of Mozart minuets were divided into segments that either did or did not correspond to the phrase structure of the music. Infants in both age groups listened significantly longer to the appropriately segmented versions. Their behavior accorded well with judgments of the same materials made by adults, suggesting that protracted musical experience may not be necessary to perceive phrase structure in music. Strong correlations were found between certain musical variables and the infants' preferences for the musical passages, pointing to acoustic properties that may be important for defining musical phrases.},

	abstract     = {We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy). Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.}

	abstract     = {Contextual word representations, typically trained on unstructured, unlabeled text, do not contain any explicit grounding to real world entities and are often unable to remember facts about those entities. We propose a general method to embed multiple knowledge bases (KBs) into large scale models, and thereby enhance their representations with structured, human-curated knowledge. For each KB, we first use an integrated entity linker to retrieve relevant entity embeddings, then update contextual word representations via a form of word-to-entity attention. In contrast to previous approaches, the entity linkers and self-supervised language modeling objective are jointly trained end-to-end in a multitask setting that combines a small amount of entity linking supervision with a large amount of raw text. After integrating WordNet and a subset of Wikipedia into BERT, the knowledge enhanced BERT (KnowBert) demonstrates improved perplexity, ability to recall facts as measured in a probing task and downstream performance on relationship extraction, entity typing, and word sense disambiguation. KnowBert{'}s runtime is comparable to BERT{'}s and it scales to large KBs.}

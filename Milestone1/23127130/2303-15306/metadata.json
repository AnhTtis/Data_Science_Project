    "abstract": "Structure perception is a fundamental aspect of music cognition in humans. Historically, the hierarchical organization of music into structures served as a narrative device for conveying meaning, creating expectancy, and evoking emotions in the listener. Thereby, musical structures play an essential role in music composition, as they shape the musical discourse through which the composer organises his ideas. In this paper, we present a novel music segmentation method, pitchclass2vec, based on symbolic chord annotations, which are embedded into continuous vector representations using both natural language processing techniques and custom-made encodings. Our algorithm is based on long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network and outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques based on symbolic chord annotations in the field.",

abstract = { The classes of inventory systems studied in this paper involve random, captive demand and assume continuous review of inventory and replenishment of stock in lots of size Q. The replenishment doctrine is to initiate an order for Q items whenever the sum of stock on hand and stock on order falls below a pre-determined level R. Possible examples are inventories of spare parts for maintenance, of military supplies, or of merchandising stock, so costs of purchase, of storage, and of backordenng are included in the measures of effectiveness. A general relation, between cost of back-orders and minimal-cost probability of stock-out, is derived, similar to that reported earlier [Morse, P. M. 1959. Solution of a class of discrete-time inventory problems. Opns Res. 7 67–78.] for discrete-time systems. For the first class of system studied, demands arrive at random, with a stationary probability distribution of arbitrary form, and all replenishment times are of the same length. For the second class, demand arrivals are Poisson and replenishment times are distributed exponentially. Exact solutions, together with expressions for expected values of operating cost, probability of stock-out, Pout, of stock on hand, etc., are obtained for both classes of system. For the first class, specific formulas are given for the frequently-encountered cases of Poisson and stuttering Poisson demand arrivals. An asymptotic form for these solutions is obtained, valid for both classes of system over the range of parameters of practical interest. In terms of this asymptotic formulation, equations, tables, and graphs are given, from which the re-order level R and replenishment lot size Q can be determined for minimal cost and/or for a pre-set value of Pout, or to satisfy other managerial requirements. For Poisson demand, comparison between the two systems shows that when Q is small, increase in variance of replenishment time makes very little difference in the requirements for R, but when Q is large an increase in variance of replenishment time requires an increase in the value of R, the re-order level, to maintain the optimality of the solution. }

It is observed that the increase in the average photon multiplicity as a function of beam energy is compatible with both a logarithmic and a power-law dependence. The relative increase in average photon multiplicity produced in inelastic pp collisions at 2.76 and 7 TeV center-of-mass energies with respect to 0.9 TeV are 37.2 {\$}{\$}{\backslash}pm {\$}{\$}0.3 {\%} (stat) {\$}{\$}{\backslash}pm {\$}{\$}8.8 {\%} (sys) and 61.2 {\$}{\$}{\backslash}pm {\$}{\$}0.3 {\%} (stat) {\$}{\$}{\backslash}pm {\$}{\$}7.6 {\%} (sys), respectively. The photon multiplicity distributions for all center-of-mass energies are well described by negative binomial distributions. The multiplicity distributions are also presented in terms of KNO variables. The results are compared to model predictions, which are found in general to underestimate the data at large photon multiplicities, in particular at the highest center-of-mass energy. Limiting fragmentation behavior of photons has been explored with the data, but is not observed in the measured pseudorapidity range.},

title = {The ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC},
journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries.  Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m3 with a total weight  of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data  taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation,  with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.}

 abstract = {This paper examines a stochastic process for Bose-Einstein statistics that is based on Gibrat's Law (roughly: the probability of a new occurrence of an event is proportional to the number of times it has occurred previously). From the necessary conditions for the steady state of the process are derived, under two slightly different sets of boundary conditions, the geometric distribution and the Yule distribution, respectively. The latter derivation provides a simpler method than the one earlier proposed by Hill [J. Amer. Statist. Ass. (1974) 69, 1017-1026] for obtaining the Pareto Law (a limiting case of the Yule distribution) from Bose-Einstein statistics. The stochastic process is applied to the phenomena of city sizes and growth.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper discusses the properties of positive, integer valued compound Poisson processes and compares two members of the family: the geometric Poisson (stuttering Poisson) and the logarithmic Poisson. It is shown that the geometric Poisson process is particularly convenient when the analyst is interested in a simple model for the time between events, as in simulation. On the other hand, the logarithmic Poisson process is more convenient in analytic models in which the state probabilities (probabilities for the number of events in a specified time period) are required. These state probabilities have a negative binomial distribution. The state probabilities of the geometric Poisson process, known as the geometric Poisson distribution, are tabled for 160 sets of parameter values. The values of mean demand range from 0.10 to 10; those for variance to mean ratio from 1.5 to 7. It is observed that the geometric Poisson density is bimodal.},

For {Pb+Pb} triton production was also measured. The p and d spectra as well as the p and t spectra were observed in similar rapidity ranges and over similar ranges of transverse momenta per nucleon, making it possible to interpret the cross sections of the composite particles in terms of coalescence mechanisms. Volumes of homogeneity were extracted and compared to pion-pair HBT interferometry results. Special attention is given to the dependence on transverse mass, centrality and rapidity.},

journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
abstract = {Multiplicity distributions (MDs)  measured in multiparticle production processes are most frequently described by the negative binomial distribution (NBD). However, with increasing collision energy some systematic discrepancies have become more and more apparent. They are usually attributed to the possible multi-source structure of the production process and described using a multi-NBD form of the MD. We investigate the possibility of keeping a single NBD but with its parameters depending on the multiplicity N. This is done by modifying the widely known clan model of particle production leading to the NBD form of . This is then confronted with the approach based on the so-called cascade-stochastic formalism which is based on different types of recurrence relations defining . We demonstrate that a combination of both approaches allows the retrieval of additional valuable information from the MDs, namely the oscillatory behavior of the counting statistics apparently visible in the high energy data.}

In particular, we focus on cases where these combinants exhibit oscillatory behavior that can provide an invaluable new source of information about the dynamics of the process under study. We show that such behavior can be described only by specific combinations of compound distributions based on the Binomial Distribution and provide their analytical forms which can be used in further investigations and which can be helpful in the analysis of all other types of counting distributions. }

abstract={As shown recently, one can obtain additional information from the measured charged particle multiplicity distributions, P(N), by investigating the so-called modified combinants, {\$}{\$}C{\_}j{\$}{\$}, extracted from them. This information is encoded in the observed specific oscillatory behaviour of {\$}{\$}C{\_}j{\$}{\$}, which phenomenologically can be described only by some combinations of compound distributions based on the Binomial Distribution. So far this idea has been checked in pp and {\$}{\$}e^+e^-{\$}{\$} processes (where observed oscillations are spectacularly strong). In this paper we continue observation of multiparticle production from the modified combinants perspective by investigating dependencies of the observed oscillatory patterns on type of colliding particles, their energies and the phase space where they are observed. We also offer some tentative explanation based on different types of compound distributions and stochastic branching processes.},

abstract = { Multiparticle production processes provide valuable information about the mechanism of the conversion of the initial energy of projectiles into a number of secondaries by measuring their multiplicity distributions and their distributions in phase space. They therefore serve as a reference point for more involved measurements. Distributions in phase space are usually investigated using the statistical approach, very successful in general but failing in cases of small colliding systems, small multiplicities, and at the edges of the allowed phase space, in which cases the underlying dynamical effects competing with the statistical distributions take over. We discuss an alternative approach, which applies to the whole phase space without detailed knowledge of dynamics. It is based on a modification of the usual statistics by generalizing it to a superstatistical form. We stress particularly the scaling and self-similar properties of such an approach manifesting themselves as the phenomena of the log-periodic oscillations and oscillations of temperature caused by sound waves in hadronic matter. Concerning the multiplicity distributions we discuss in detail the phenomenon of the oscillatory behavior of the modified combinants apparently observed in experimental data. }

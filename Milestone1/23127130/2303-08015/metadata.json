    "abstract": "A cooperative drug delivery system is proposed, where quorum sensing (QS), a density-dependent bacterial behavior coordination mechanism, is employed by synthetic bacterium-based nanomachines (B-NMs) for controllable drug delivery. In our proposed system, drug delivery is only triggered when there are enough QS molecules, which in turn only happens when there are enough B-NMs. This makes the proposed system can be used to achieve a high release rate of drug molecules from a high number of B-NMs when the population density of B-NMs may not be known. Analytical expressions for i) the expected activation probability of the B-NM due to randomly-distributed B-NMs and ii) the expected aggregate absorption rate of drug molecules due to randomly-distributed QS activated B-NMs are derived. Analytical results are verified by particle-based simulations. The derived results can help to predict and control the impact of environmental factors (e.g. diffusion coefficient and degradation rate) on the absorption rate of drug molecules since rigorous diffusion-based molecular channels are considered. Our results show that the activation probability at the B-NM increases as this B-NM is located closer to the center of the B-NM population and the aggregate absorption rate of the drug molecules non-linearly increases as the population density increases.",

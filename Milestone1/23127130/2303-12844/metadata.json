    "abstract": "We correct an error in Lemma 3.1 of my paper coauthored with Ran Levi on the Benson-Solomon fusion systems, and show that the change does not affect any of the other results in that paper. More precisely, as pointed out to us by Justin Lynd, there are two conjugacy classes of elementary abelian subgroups of rank $3$ in each of the fusion systems $\\cal{F}_{\\rm Sol}(q)$, and not only one as claimed in our paper.",

    "abstract": "Short-ranged and line-gapped non-hermitian Hamiltonians have strong topological invariants given by an index of an associated Fredholm operator. It is shown how these invariants can be accessed via the signature of a suitable spectral localizer. This numerical technique is implemented in an example with relevance to the design of topological photonic systems, such as topological lasers.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-wideband (UWB) localization methods have emerged as a cost-effective and accurate solution for GNSS-denied environments. There is a significant amount of previous research in terms of resilience of UWB ranging, with non-line-of-sight and multipath detection methods. However, little attention has been paid to resilience against disturbances in relative localization systems involving multiple nodes. This paper presents an approach to detecting range anomalies in UWB ranging measurements from the perspective of multi-robot cooperative localization. We introduce an approach to exploiting redundancy for relative localization in multi-robot systems, where the position of each node is calculated using different subsets of available data. This enables us to effectively identify nodes that present ranging anomalies and eliminate their effect within the cooperative localization scheme. We analyze anomalies created by timing errors in the ranging process, e.g., owing to malfunctioning hardware. However, our method is generic and can be extended to other types of ranging anomalies. Our approach results in a more resilient cooperative localization framework with a negligible impact in terms of the computational workload.",

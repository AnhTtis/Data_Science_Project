    "abstract": "In this answer to the Comment by Hansen and Engelen it is shown, that if there is any violation of the baryon number conservation law in H(0) nuclear reactions, it is not at all of the form that the authors believe. Their belief is disproved by cited well-known scientific results from other groups. It is further shown that quantum mechanics in H(0) molecules is different than these authors believe, not formulated in kinetic energy terms but defined by angular momentum quantization. Repetition of experiments is required, not pondering by non-specialists.",

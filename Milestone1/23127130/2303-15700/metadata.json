    "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of estimation of scalar field distribution collected from noisy measurements. The field is modelled as a sum of Fourier components/modes, where the number of modes retained and estimated determines in a natural way the approximation quality. An algorithm for estimating the modes using an online optimization approach is presented, under the assumption that the noisy measurements are quantized. The algorithm can estimate time-varying fields through the introduction of a forgetting factor. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic semiconductors are at the core of recent spintronics research endeavors. Chemically doped II-VI diluted magnetic semiconductors, such as (Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$)Te, provide promising platform in this quest. However, a detailed knowledge of the microscopic nature of magnetic ground state is necessary for any practical application. Here, we report on the synergistic study of (Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$)Te single crystals using elastic neutron scattering measurements and density functional calculations. For the first time, our research unveils the intrinsic properties of ferromagnetic state in macroscopic specimen of (Zn$_{0.8}$Cr$_{0.2}$)Te. The ferromagnetism is onset at $T_c \\sim$ 290 K and remains somewhat independent to modest change in the substitution coefficient x. We show that magnetic moments on Zn/Cr site develop ferromagnetic correlation in a-c plane with large ordered moment of $μ$ = 3.08 $μ_B$. Magnetic moment across the lattice is induced via the mediation of Te site, uncoupled to the number of dopant carriers as inferred from the density functional calculation. Additionally, the ab-initio calculations also reveal half-metallicity in x = 0.2 composition. These properties are highly desirable for future spintronic applications.",

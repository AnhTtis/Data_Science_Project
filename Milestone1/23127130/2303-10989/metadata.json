    "abstract": "We continue the study of the fine properties of sets having locally finite distributional fractional perimeter. We refine the characterization of their blow-ups and prove a Leibniz rule for the intersection of sets with locally finite distributional fractional perimeter with sets with finite fractional perimeter. As a byproduct, we provide a description of non-local boundaries associated with the distributional fractional perimeter.",

@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The reasons are as follows: (i) the discrete distribution function $f_i$ cannot be differentiated with respect to discrete velocity $\protect \bf  {v}$, so $f$ needs to be replaced by $f^{eq}$ before discretization, (ii) the assumption $f = f^{eq}$ suits for the cases where the non-equilibrium effects caused by force term is sufficiently weak, (iii) if the non-equilibrium effects caused by force term needs to considered, we can gradually add higher order terms according to CE multi-scale analysis $f = f^{eq} + Knf^{(1)} + Kn^2f^{(2)} + \protect \cdots  $."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="Physically, the effects of viscous stress, heat conduction and electrical conductivity are all caused by particle collisions. The model in this paper considers a simplified case where the electrical conductivity is assumed to be infinity, which is consistent with the model of \protect \citet  {liu2018physical}. The finite electrical conductivity case will be considered in the following study."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="where the viscous stress and heat conduction may contain not only the contribution of $f^{(1)}$ , among which the NS viscous stress and NS heat conduction are the simplest cases"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="where the model equations include not only the evolution equations of density, momentum and energy, but also those of the most relevant non-conserved kinetic moments"}

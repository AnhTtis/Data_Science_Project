    "abstract": "A systematic study of the $β$-decay of neutron-deficient nuclei has been carried out and has provided spectroscopic information of importance for both nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. Following an overview of the most relevant achievements, we focus on the latest results on the $β$ decay of $^{60}$Ge and $^{62}$Ge. We also summarise our results on the mass excesses in comparison with systematics and a recent measurement. Finally, we present updated half-life trends for $T_z=$ -1/2, -1 and -2 neutron-deficient nuclides.",

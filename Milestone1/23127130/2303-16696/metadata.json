    "abstract": "Age-specific mortality improvements are non-uniform, neither across ages nor across time. We propose a two-step procedure to estimate the rates of mortality improvement (RMI) in age-specific death rates (ASDR) at ages 85 and above for ten European countries from 1950 to 2019. In the first step, we smooth the raw death counts and estimate ASDR using four different methods: one parametric (gamma-Gompertz-Makeham), two non-parametric (P-splines and PCLM), and a novel Bayesian procedure to handle fluctuations resulting from ages with zero death counts. We compare the goodness of fit of the four smoothing methods and calculate the year-to-year ASDR differences according to the best-fitting one. We fit a piecewise linear function to these differences in the second step. The slope in each linear segment captures the average RMI in the respective year range. For each age, we calculate the goodness of fit in the last linear segment to assess how informative the estimated RMI of current mortality change is. The estimated rates of mortality improvement or deterioration (RMI) can be used to make short-term social, health, and social planning, as well as more precise mortality forecasts.",

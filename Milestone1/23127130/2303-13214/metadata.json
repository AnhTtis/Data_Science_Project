    "abstract": "The transparency of the hadrons produced in the $γ(n,p) π^-$ reaction in nuclei is calculated using the Glauber model modified by including the Fermi motion of the nucleon in the nucleus. Since the calculated results underestimates the measured transparency for $^4$He nucleus, the Glauber model is further modified by incorporating the short-range correlation of the nucleon and the color transparency of the hadron in the nucleus. The nuclear transparency of the $γ(n,p) π^-$ reaction is calculated for $θ_{π^-}$(c.m.) = 50$^{\\circ}$, 70$^{\\circ}$ and 90$^{\\circ}$. The calculated results are compared with the data reported for $^4$He nucleus.",

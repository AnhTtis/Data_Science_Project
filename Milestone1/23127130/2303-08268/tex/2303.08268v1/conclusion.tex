\section{CONCLUSIONS}

% LLMs have become attractive because of their impressive ability in many fields that require human-like reasoning.
% We show that LLMs augmented with multimodal perceptions provide efficient and effective solutions for robotic manipulations, especially when it comes to uncovering object latent properties.
LLMs have shown their impressive ability in language generation and human-like reasoning. 
% The potential of integrating with and boosting other domains is attracting increasing attention from various fields of research. 
Their potential for integration and enhancement with other fields has attracted growing attention from different research areas.
In this work, we demonstrate the superiority of using an LLM to realize interactive multimodal perception. 
We propose Matcha, a multimodal interactive agent augmented with LLMs, and evaluate it on the task of uncovering object latent properties. 
Experimental results suggest that our agent is able to perform interactive multimodal perception reasonably by taking advantage of the commonsense knowledge residing in the LLM, and easily generalize to various scenarios by virtue of its modularity and flexibility.

% We show that Matcha, our multimodal interactive agent augmented with LLMs, exhibits efficient activeness and effective reasoning ability for uncovering object latent properties.

% While LLMs can be accessed online, e.g.\ through OpenAI GPT3 APIs, this option can be costly, non-producible, and unreliable for robots without stable internet connections. On the other hand, t
While strong LLMs perform well for tasks that require general knowledge, training and maintaining LLMs locally is currently not feasible, given the large computation and memory resources required by such models. % with, for example, over 175 billion parameters. 
Future works will involve distilling the domain-specific knowledge from LLMs into more manageable local models, which can offer greater flexibility and control while maintaining high levels of performance for robotic applications. 
Furthermore, there is a necessity for additional investigation of prompt engineering techniques to augment the ability for multi-step reasoning when comparing diverse objects.

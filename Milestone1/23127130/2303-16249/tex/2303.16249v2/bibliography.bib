title = {The iPad as a virtual oscilloscope for measuring time constants in RC and LR circuits},
journal = {Physics Education},
abstract = {In a university introductory physics laboratory, the measurement of time constants in RC and LR circuits usually employ a conventional oscilloscope. The standard oscilloscope with its many knobs and switches often intimidate first-time users and can cause anxiety especially among non-physics and non-engineering majors. On the other hand, an iPad has a more familiar, less intimidating and friendlier touch-pad interface. We report our experience in using the iPad as a virtual oscilloscope in an introductory algebra-based physics laboratory course. We used a commercial electronic accessory called Oscium iMSO that turns the iPad into a virtual oscilloscope. Using blind surveys and direct observation, we report student responses to this pedagogical tool.}

  abstract	= {In this work, we propose an inexpensive laboratory
		  practice for an introductory physics course laboratory for
		  any grade of science and engineering study. This practice
		  was very well received by our students, where a smartphone
		  (iOS, Android, or Windows) is used together with mini
		  magnets (similar to those used on refrigerator doors), a 20
		  cm long school rule, a paper, and a free application (app)
		  that needs to be downloaded and installed that measures
		  magnetic fields using the smartphone’s magnetic field
		  sensor or magnetometer. The apps we have used are:
		  Magnetometer (iOS), Magnetometer Metal Detector, and
		  Physics Toolbox Magnetometer (Android). Nothing else is
		  needed. Cost of this practice: free. The main purpose of
		  the practice is that students determine the dependence of
		  the component x of the magnetic field produced by different
		  magnets (including ring magnets and sphere magnets). We
		  obtained that the dependency of the magnetic field with the
		  distance is of the form x –3 , in total agreement with
		  the theoretical analysis. The secondary objective is to
		  apply the technique of least squares fit to obtain this
		  exponent and the magnetic moment of the magnets, with the
		  corresponding absolute error.}

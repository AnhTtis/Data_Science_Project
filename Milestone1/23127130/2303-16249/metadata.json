    "abstract": "Simple, portable and low-cost experiments as RC and RL series circuits are proposed as examples to experiment with DC circuits. Very common elements are used: few electronics components (resistors, capacitors, coils and connecting wires) and two martphones. We consider the charging and discharging of a capacitor in the RC circuit and also that of coil in the RL circuit. Using a smartphone as a oscilloscope we observe voltages variations which are the transient response to a square signal generated in the second smartphones. These voltage variations are directly related to the electrostatic or magnetic energy stored in the circuits. The experimental data have been collected with the smartphone used as an oscilloscope. This approach which avoids the use of expensive signal generators, oscilloscopes, or any specialized hardware can be performed in less-favored contexts and even as a home assignment.",

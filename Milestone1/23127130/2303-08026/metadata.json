    "abstract": "With the ubiquity of smart devices that use speaker recognition (SR) systems as a means of authenticating individuals and personalizing their services, fairness of SR systems has becomes an important point of focus. In this paper we study the notion of fairness in recent SR systems based on 3 popular and relevant definitions, namely Statistical Parity, Equalized Odds, and Equal Opportunity. We examine 5 popular neural architectures and 5 commonly used loss functions in training SR systems, while evaluating their fairness against gender and nationality groups. Our detailed experiments shed light on this concept and demonstrate that more sophisticated encoder architectures better align with the definitions of fairness. Additionally, we find that the choice of loss functions can significantly impact the bias of SR models.",

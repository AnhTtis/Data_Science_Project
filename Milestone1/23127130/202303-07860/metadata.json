    "abstract": "A problem of constructing the trajectory of a spacecraft flight to Venus\nwithin the framework of a mission including landing of a lander in a given\nregion of the planet's surface is being considered. A new celestial mechanics\nrelated method based on the use of gravity assist maneuver near Venus is\nproposed to transfer the spacecraft to a heliocentric orbit resonant with the\norbit of Venus, so that, at the next approach the planet, the given region of\nthe surface becomes attainable for landing. It is shown that the best resonant\norbit in terms of the cost of the characteristic velocity is an orbit with a\n1:1 ratio of the period to the orbital period of Venus. A procedure for\nchoosing one of possible resonant orbits depending on coordinates of the\ndesired landing point on the surface and the launch date of the mission is\ndescribed. An example of calculating the flight trajectory that ensures landing\nin the Vellamo-South region of the Venus surface at launch from the Earth in\n2031 is considered.",

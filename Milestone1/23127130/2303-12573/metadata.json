    "abstract": "Imaging through scattering is a pervasive and difficult problem in many biological applications. The high background and the exponentially attenuated target signals due to scattering fundamentally limits the imaging depth of fluorescence microscopy. Light-field systems are favorable for high-speed volumetric imaging, but the 2D-to-3D reconstruction is fundamentally ill-posed and scattering exacerbates the condition of the inverse problem. Here, we develop a scattering simulator that models low-contrast target signals buried in heterogeneous strong background. We then train a deep neural network solely on synthetic data to descatter and reconstruct a 3D volume from a single-shot light-field measurement with low signal-to-background ratio (SBR). We apply this network to our previously developed Computational Miniature Mesoscope and demonstrate the robustness of our deep learning algorithm on a 75 micron thick fixed mouse brain section and on bulk scattering phantoms with different scattering conditions. The network can robustly reconstruct emitters in 3D with a 2D measurement of SBR as low as 1.05 and as deep as a scattering length. We analyze fundamental tradeoffs based on network design factors and out-of-distribution data that affect the deep learning model's generalizability to real experimental data. Broadly, we believe that our simulator-based deep learning approach can be applied to a wide range of imaging through scattering techniques where experimental paired training data is lacking.",

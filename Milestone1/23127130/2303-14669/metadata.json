    "abstract": "We consider the six-vertex model with Domain Wall Boundary Conditions. Our main interest is the study of the fluctuations of the extremal lattice path about the arctic curves. We address the problem through Monte Carlo simulations. At $Δ= 0$, the fluctuations of the extremal path along any line parallel to the square diagonal were rigorously proven to follow the Tracy-Widom distribution. We provide strong numerical evidence that this is true also for other values of the anisotropy parameter $Δ$ ($0\\leq Δ< 1$). We argue that the typical width of the fluctuations of the extremal path about the arctic curves scales as $N^{1/3}$ and provide a numerical estimate for the parameters of the scaling random variable.",

    "abstract": "Handovers frequently occur in our social environments, making it imperative for a collaborative robotic system to master the skill of handover. In this work, we aim to investigate the relationship between the grip force variation for a human giver and the sensed interaction force-torque in human-human handovers, utilizing a data-driven approach. A Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network was trained to use the interaction force-torque in a handover to predict the human grip force variation in advance. Further, we propose to utilize the trained network to cause human-like grip force variation for a robotic giver.",

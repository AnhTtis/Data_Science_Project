    "abstract": "We prove that the cohomology algebra of a conilpotent Lie coalgebra is generated in degree 1 as an A-infinity algebra. By dualizing, the same is true about cohomology algebras of finite dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras. In the process, we provide a proof of the conilpotent version of the dual Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem.",

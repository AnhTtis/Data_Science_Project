    "abstract": "We extend the YFS IR resummation theory to include all of the attendant collinear contributions which exponentiate. This improves the original YFS formulation in which only a part of these contributions was exponentiated. We show that the new resummed contributions agree with known results from the collinear factorization approach and we argue that they improve the attendant precision tag for a given level of exactness in the respective YFS hard radiation residuals.",

\section{Conclusions}

This work introduces PAL, a learning framework that revolves around the central concept of similarity graph.
We first showed how similarity graphs are the implicit backbone of self-supervised learning methods, and how this concept extends to tackle supervised learning problems.
This observation does not solely unveil a rich learning framework, but also provides a single algorithm based on a querying oracle that can describe both SSL and supervised learning techniques, opening the way to new oracles that benefit from techniques stemming from both the supervised and self-supervised learning literature.
Finally, PAL leads to an efficient formalization of active learning as performed in practice to annotate large datasets, potentially enabling fruitful exchanges between the practice and the theory of active learning.
Promising directions for future works include empirical validations on large-scale datasets, as well as theoretical study of the newly introduced active learning framework.

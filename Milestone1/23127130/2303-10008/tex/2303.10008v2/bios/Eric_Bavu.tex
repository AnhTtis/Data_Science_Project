is a Full Professor of Acoustics and Signal Processing at the Laboratoire de Mécanique des Structures et des Systèmes Couplés (LMSSC) within the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (Cnam), Paris, France. He completed his undergraduate studies at École Normale Supérieure de Cachan, France, from 2001 to 2005. In 2005, he earned an M.Sc in Acoustics, Signal Processing, and Computer Science Applied to Music from Université Pierre et Marie Curie Sorbonne University (UPMC), followed by a Ph.D. in Acoustics jointly awarded by Université de Sherbrooke, Canada, and UPMC, France, in 2008. He also conducted post-doctoral research on biological soft tissues imaging at the Langevin Institute at École Supérieure de Physique et Chimie ParisTech (ESPCI), France. Since 2009, he has supervised six Ph.D. students at LMSSC, focusing on time domain audio signal processing for inverse problems, 3D audio, and deep learning for audio. His current research interests encompass deep learning methods applied to inverse problems in acoustics, moving sound source localization and tracking, speech enhancement, and speech recognition.

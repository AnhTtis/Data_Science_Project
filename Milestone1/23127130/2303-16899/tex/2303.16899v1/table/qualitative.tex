    \caption{\textbf{Qualitative examples of automatically generated AD by AutoAD.}
    We highlight AD predictions under both the oracle and recurrent settings.
    Previous AD context is shown in {\color{gray}gray}. For ease of visualisation, a single frame from each movie clip is shown with subtitles overlaid. 
    Samples are taken from Titanic (1997)~\cite{titanic}.

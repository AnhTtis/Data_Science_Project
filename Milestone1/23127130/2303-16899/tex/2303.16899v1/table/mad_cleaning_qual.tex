\caption{\textbf{Qualitative comparison of MAD annotations.} We compare the original MAD-v1~\cite{soldan2022mad} and our proposed MAD-v2. Note MAD-v1's erroneous transcriptions of AD and dialogue leakage (highlighted in {\color{red}red text}). The samples are taken from Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)~\cite{starwars83}. *We verify this example by manually transcribing the AD narration from the audio track.

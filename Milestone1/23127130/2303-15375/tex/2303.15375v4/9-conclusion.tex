\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

%CXL memory has emerged as a standard of memory expansion and disaggregation technologies.
%However, despite active investment on CXL memory, the understanding of true CXL memory devices and their implications on system performance is falling behind.

In this paper, we have taken a first step to analyze the device-specific characteristics of true \cxlmem and compared them with NUMA-based emulations, a common practice in CXL research. % \cxlmem. 
Our analysis revealed key differences between emulated and true \cxlmem, with important performance implications. Our analysis also identified opportunities to effectively use
CXL memory as a memory bandwidth expander for memory-bandwidth-intensive applications, which leads to the development of a CXL-memory-aware dynamic page allocation policy and demonstrated its efficacy. 
%We hope that our work can facilitate the CXL-memory ecosystem and community. We will make \arch{} and \policy{} publicly available.

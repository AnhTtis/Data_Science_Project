\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}
CXL has emerged as the future standard of device interconnect with a rich set of useful features, and CXL memory is an important one among them. In this work, based on the state-of-the-art real hardware, we performed a detailed characterization analysis on CXL memory, using both micro-benchmarks and real applications. With the unique observations on CXL memory behavior, we also propose several usage guidelines for the programmers to best take advantage of CXL memory. We hope this work can facilitate the development and adoption of the CXL memory ecosystem.

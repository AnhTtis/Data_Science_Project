In this study, we benchmark the scalability of the distributed stream processing frameworks, particularly suited for implementing event-driven microservices.
We experimentally evaluate the frameworks  Apache Flink, Apache Kafka Streams, Hazelcast Jet, and Apache Beam with the Apache Flink runner and the Apache Samza runner in a private cloud environment and in the Google Cloud.
We find that all frameworks show linear scalability for most use cases, however with partially significantly different resource demands.
There is no clear superior framework. Instead, depending on the use case Flink, Hazelcast Jet, or Kafka Streams show the lowest increase in resource demand.
Using Apache Beam as abstraction layer still comes with a significant negative impact on performance, leading to a significantly steeper increase in resource demand, independent of the use case.
This highlights one of the advantages of event-driven microservice architectures, namely that each service can choose the stream framework depending on its use case, requirements for scalability, and additional considerations.
We observe our results regardless of scaling load on a microservice, scaling the computational work performed inside the microservice, the selected cloud environment, and whether the microservice is scaled over multiple nodes or on a single node.
The latter means that vertical scaling can---to some extent---also be an alternative to horizontal scaling for distributed stream processing frameworks.
This leaves room for future research on exploring the multi-dimensional space of cloud deployment options and finding an optimal one.
Moreover, our work paves the way for deeper analysis of the underlying reasons for our observed results by benchmarking further task samples, deployment, and configuration options.

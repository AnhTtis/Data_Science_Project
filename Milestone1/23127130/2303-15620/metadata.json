    "abstract": "For legged robots to operate in complex terrains, they must be robust to the disturbances and uncertainties they encounter. This paper contributes to enhancing robustness through the design of fall detection/prediction algorithms that will provide sufficient lead time for corrective motions to be taken. Falls can be caused by abrupt (fast-acting), incipient (slow-acting), or intermittent (non-continuous) faults. Early fall detection is a challenging task due to the masking effects of controllers (through their disturbance attenuation actions), the inverse relationship between lead time and false positive rates, and the temporal behavior of the faults/underlying factors. In this paper, we propose a fall detection algorithm that is capable of detecting both incipient and abrupt faults while maximizing lead time and meeting desired thresholds on the false positive and negative rates.",

% For legged robots to navigate across complex terrains, they must be robust to any disturbances and uncertainties they may encounter. Robustness can be increased using various methods such as designing and implementing feedback controllers, however, as it is infeasible to account for all disturbances and uncertainties falling is inevitable. Falls are undesirable as they can prevent a robot from completing its task, result in irreparable damage or lead to operator/bystander injuries. Therefore, it is imperative to design and implement fall detection algorithms for robots. Falls can be caused by abrupt (fast acting), incipient (slow acting) or intermittent (non-continuous) faults. The objective of a fall detection algorithm is to accurately detect falls with sufficient time to implement corrective motions. Early fall detection is a challenging task due to the masking effects of controllers, the inverse relationship between lead time and false positive rates, and the temporal behavior of the faults/underlying factors. In this paper, we propose a fall detection algorithm that is capable of detecting both incipient and abrupt faults while maximizing lead time and meeting desired thresholds on the false positive and negative rates. \eva{1st attempt, might need to redo abstract}

\begin{abstract}
For legged robots to operate in complex terrains, they must be robust to the disturbances and uncertainties they encounter. This paper contributes to enhancing robustness through the design of fall detection/prediction algorithms that will provide sufficient lead time for corrective motions to be taken. Falls can be caused by abrupt (fast-acting), incipient (slow-acting), or intermittent (non-continuous) faults. Early fall detection is a challenging task due to the masking effects of controllers (through their disturbance attenuation actions), the inverse relationship between lead time and false positive rates, and the temporal behavior of the faults/underlying factors. In this paper, we propose a fall detection algorithm that is capable of detecting both incipient and abrupt faults while maximizing lead time and meeting desired thresholds on the false positive and negative rates.

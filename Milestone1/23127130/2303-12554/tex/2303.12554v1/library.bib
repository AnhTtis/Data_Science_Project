@article{Jia2008a,
abstract = {In this paper, a new class of numerical methods for the accurate and efficient solutions of parabolic partial differential equations is presented. Unlike traditional method of lines (MoL), the new Krylov deferred correction (KDC) accelerated method of lines transpose(MoLT) first discretizes the temporal direction using Gaussian type nodes and spectral integration, and symbolically applies low-order time marching schemes to form a preconditioned elliptic system, which is then solved iteratively using Newton-Krylov techniques such as Newton-GMRES or Newton-BiCGStab method. Each function evaluation in the Newton-Krylov method is simply one low-order time-stepping approximation of the error by solving a decoupled system using available fast elliptic equation solvers. Preliminary numerical experiments show that the KDC accelerated MoLT technique is unconditionally stable, can be spectrally accurate in both temporal and spatial directions, and allows optimal time-stepsizes in long-time simulations. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Bezanson2017,
abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

abstract = {We introduce a numerical method based on an integral equation formulation for simulating drops in viscous fluids in the plane. It builds upon the method introduced by Kropinski in 2001 [17], but improves on it by adding an interpolatory quadrature approach for handling near-singular integrals. Such integrals typically arise when drop boundaries come close to one another, and are difficult to compute accurately using standard quadrature rules. Adapting the interpolatory quadrature method introduced by Helsing and Ojala in 2008 [11] to the current application, very general drop configurations can be handled while still maintaining stability and high accuracy. The performance of the new method is demonstrated by some challenging numerical examples.},

abstract = {We present a simple, accurate method for computing singular or nearly singular integrals on a smooth, closed surface, such as layer potentials for harmonic functions evaluated at points on or near the surface. The integral is computed with a regularized kernel and corrections are added for regularization and discretization, which are found from analysis near the singular point. The surface integrals are computed from a new quadrature rule using surface points which project onto grid points in coordinate planes. The method does not require coordinate charts on the surface or special treatment of the singularity other than the corrections. The accuracy is about $O(h^3)$, where $h$ is the spacing in the background grid, uniformly with respect to the point of evaluation, on or near the surface. Improved accuracy is obtained for points on the surface. The treecode of Duan and Krasny for Ewald summation is used to perform sums. Numerical examples are presented with a variety of surfaces.},

@article{Lee2003,
abstract = {The method developed in this paper is motivated by Peskin's immersed boundary (IB) method, and allows one to model the motion of flexible membranes or other structures immersed in viscous incompressible fluid using a fluid solver on a fixed Cartesian grid. The IB method uses a set of discrete delta functions to spread the entire singular force exerted by the immersed boundary to the nearby fluid grid points. Our method instead incorporates part of this force into jump conditions for the pressure, avoiding discrete dipole terms that adversely affect the accuracy near the immersed boundary. This has been implemented for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a high-resolution finite-volume method for the advective terms and a projection method to enforce incompressibility. In the projection step, the correct jump in pressure is imposed in the course of solving the Poisson problem. This gives sharp resolution of the pressure across the interface and also gives better volume conservation than the traditional IB method. Comparisons between this method and the IB method are presented for several test problems. Numerical studies of the convergence and order of accuracy are included.},

@phdthesis{Lindbo2011,
abstract = {This work contains two separate but related parts: one on spectrally accurate and fast Ewald methods for electrostatics and viscous flow, and one on micro- and complex fluid interface problems. In Part I we are concerned with fast and spectrally accurate methods to compute sums of slowly decaying potentials over periodic lattices. We consider two PDEs: Laplace (electrostatics, the Coulomb potential) and Stokes (viscous flow, the “Stokeslet” potential). Moreover, we consider both full and planar periodicity, the latter meaning that periodicity applies in two dimensions and the third is “free”. These are major simulation tasks in current molecular dynamics simulations and in many areas of computational fluid mechanics involving e.g. particle suspensions. For each of the four combinations of PDE and periodic structure, we give spectrally accurate and O(N logN) fast methods based on Ewald's or Ewaldlike decompositions of the underlying potential sums. In the plane-periodic cases we derive the decompositions in a manner that lets us develop fast methods. Associated error estimates are developed as needed throughout. All four methods can be placed in the P3M/PME (Particle Mesh Ewald) family. We argue that they have certain novel and attractive features: first, they are spectral accurate; secondly, they use the minimal amount of memory possible within the PME family; third, each has a clear and reliable view of numerical errors, such that parameters can be chosen wisely. Analytical and numerical results are given to support these propositions. We benchmark accuracy and performance versus an established (S)PME method. Part II deals with free boundary problems, specifically numerical methods for multiphase flow. We give an interface tracking method based on a domain-decomposition idea that lets us split the interface into overlapping patches. Each patch is discretized on a uniform grid, and accurate and efficient numerical methods are given for the equations that govern interface transport. We demonstrate that the method is accurate and how it's used in immersed boundary, and interface, Navier-Stokes methods, as well as in a boundary integral Stokes setting. Finally, we consider a problem in complex fluidics where there is a concentration of surfactants on the interface and the interface itself is in contact with a solid boundary (the contact line problem). We argue that the domaindecomposition framework is attractive for formulating and treating complex models (e.g. involving PDEs on a dynamic interface) and proceed with developing various aspects of such a method.},

abstract = {Panel-based, kernel-split quadrature is currently one of the most efficient methods available for accurate evaluation of singular and nearly singular layer potentials in two dimensions. However, it can fail completely for the layer potentials belonging to the modified Helmholtz, biharmonic and Stokes equations. These equations depend on a parameter, denoted $\alpha$, and kernel-split quadrature loses its accuracy rapidly when this parameter grows beyond a certain threshold. The present report describes an algorithm that remedies this problem, using per-target adaptive sampling of the source geometry. The refinement is carried out through recursive bisection, with a carefully selected rule set. This maintains accuracy for a wide range of $\alpha$, at an increased cost that scales as $\log\alpha$. Using this algorithm allows kernel-split quadrature to be both accurate and efficient for a much wider range of problems than previously possible.},

abstract = {When solving elliptic boundary value problems using integral equation methods one may need to evaluate potentials represented by a convolution of discretized layer density sources against a kernel. Standard quadrature accelerated with a fast hierarchical method for potential field evaluation gives accurate results far away from the sources. Close to the sources this is not so. Cancellation and nearly singular kernels may cause serious degradation. This paper presents a new scheme based on a mix of composite polynomial quadrature, layer density interpolation, kernel approximation, rational quadrature, high polynomial order corrected interpolation and differentiation, temporary panel mergers and splits, and a particular implementation of the GMRES solver. Criteria for which mix is fastest and most accurate in various situations are also supplied. The paper focuses on the solution of the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation in the plane. In a series of examples we demonstrate the efficiency of the new scheme for interior domains and domains exterior to up to 2000 close-to-touching contours. Densities are computed and potentials are evaluated, rapidly and accurate to almost machine precision, at points that lie arbitrarily close to the boundaries. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Electrostatics plays a major role in the stabilization and function of biomolecules; as such, it remains a major focus of theoretical and computational studies of macromolecules. Electrostatic interactions are long range, and strongly dependent on the solvent and ions surrounding the biomolecule under study. During the past year, progress has been reported in the treatment of electrostatics in explicit and implicit solvent models. Interesting new developments of explicit solvent models include more efficient Ewald summation methods, as well as alternative approaches based on reaction field theory, periodic images and Euler summations. Implicit solvent models remain divided into those that solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically and those based on the generalized Born formalism. Both approaches are now included in molecular dynamics simulations and their accuracies may be assessed by direct comparison against experimental data. It is worth mentioning the recent development of web interfaces that facilitate access to and usage of existing tools for computing electrostatic interactions.},

abstract = {The use of integral equation methods for the efficient numerical solution of PDE boundary value problems requires two main tools: quadrature rules for the evaluation of layer potential integral operators with singular kernels, and fast algorithms for solving the resulting dense linear systems. Classically, these tools were developed separately. In this work, we present a unified numerical scheme based on coupling Quadrature by Expansion, a recent quadrature method, to a customized Fast Multipole Method (FMM) for the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions. The method allows the evaluation of layer potentials in linear-time complexity, anywhere in space, with a uniform, user-chosen level of accuracy as a black-box computational method. Providing this capability requires geometric and algorithmic considerations beyond the needs of standard FMMs as well as careful consideration of the accuracy of multipole translations. We illustrate the speed and accuracy of our method with various numerical examples.

abstract = {This article introduces a new fast direct solver for linear systems arising out of wide range of applications, integral equations, multivariate statistics, radial basis interpolation, etc., to name a few. \emph{The highlight of this new fast direct solver is that the solver scales linearly in the number of unknowns in all dimensions.} The solver, termed as Inverse Fast Multipole Method (abbreviated as IFMM), works on the same data-structure as the Fast Multipole Method (abbreviated as FMM). More generally, the solver can be immediately extended to the class of hierarchical matrices, denoted as $\mathcal{H}^2$ matrices with strong admissibility criteria (weak low-rank structure), i.e., \emph{the interaction between neighboring cluster of particles is full-rank whereas the interaction between particles corresponding to well-separated clusters can be efficiently represented as a low-rank matrix}. The algorithm departs from existing approaches in the fact that throughout the algorithm the interaction corresponding to neighboring clusters are always treated as full-rank interactions. Our approach relies on two major ideas: (i) The $N \times N$ matrix arising out of FMM (from now on termed as FMM matrix) can be represented as an extended sparser matrix of size $M \times M$, where $M \approx 3N$. (ii) While solving the larger extended sparser matrix, \emph{the fill-in's that arise in the matrix blocks corresponding to well-separated clusters are hierarchically compressed}. The ordering of the equations and the unknowns in the extended sparser matrix is strongly related to the local and multipole coefficients in the FMM$\sim$\cite{greengard1987fast} and \emph{the order of elimination is different from the usual nested dissection approach}. Numerical benchmarks on $2$D manifold confirm the linear scaling of the algorithm.},

@article{Quan2007,
abstract = {An interface tracking method using an unstructured moving mesh has been developed for simulating three-dimensional, incompressible, and immiscible two-phase flows. The interface mesh is moved in a Lagrangian fashion. A local mesh adaptation method is used to capture the changing interface curvature, maintain good mesh quality, and deal with large deformation. The interface is of zero thickness, so the jump and continuity conditions across the interface are implemented directly, without any smoothing of the properties of the two fluids. This is theoretically beneficial compared to other methods that allow the fluids' properties to continuously vary in an interface region. The curvature for interfacial tension calculation is geometrically computed by a least squares parabola fitting method. A mesh separation scheme for interfacial flows is employed to handle topological transition. The numerical technique is tested and validated by several cases, which include a two-layer Couette flow, an oscillating droplet surrounded by gas, and a droplet in shear flow. The results obtained from numerical simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with analytical solutions and experimental results. A collapsing ligament in a quiescent gas flow and a modulated jet pinching are simulated to show the robustness of the method.},

abstract = {The flow behavior of many multiphase flow applications is greatly influenced by wetting properties and the presence of surfactants. We present a numerical method for two-phase flow with insoluble surfactants and contact line dynamics in two dimensions. The method is based on decomposing the interface between two fluids into segments, which are explicitly represented on a local Eulerian grid. It provides a natural framework for treating the surfactant concentration equation, which is solved locally on each segment. An accurate numerical method for the coupled interface/surfactant system is given. The system is coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations through the immersed boundary method, and we discuss the issue of force regularization in wetting problems, when the interface touches the boundary of the domain. We use the method to illustrate how the presence of surfactants influences the behavior of free and wetting drops. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this work we develop the Spectral Ewald Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (SEASD), a novel computational method for dynamic simulations of polydisperse colloidal suspensions with full hydrodynamic interactions. SEASD is based on the framework of Stokesian Dynamics (SD) with extension to compressible solvents, and uses the Spectral Ewald (SE) method [Lindbo & Tornberg, J. Comput. Phys. 229 (2010) 8994] for the wave-space mobility computation. To meet the performance requirement of dynamic simulations, we use Graphic Processing Units (GPU) to evaluate the suspension mobility, and achieve an order of magnitude speedup compared to a CPU implementation. For further speedup, we develop a novel far-field block-diagonal preconditioner to reduce the far-field evaluations in the iterative solver, and SEASD-nf, a polydisperse extension of the mean-field Brownian approximation of Banchio & Brady [J. Chem. Phys. 118 (2003) 10323]. We extensively discuss implementation and parameter selection strategies in SEASD, and demonstrate the spectral accuracy in the mobility evaluation and the overall $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation scaling. We present three computational examples to further validate SEASD and SEASD-nf in monodisperse and bidisperse suspensions: the short-time transport properties, the equilibrium osmotic pressure and viscoelastic moduli, and the steady shear Brownian rheology. Our validation results show that the agreement between SEASD and SEASD-nf is satisfactory over a wide range of parameters, and also provide significant insight into the dynamics of polydisperse colloidal suspensions.},

In addition, LBM-like algorithms have been developed to solve microfluidics-related processes and phenomena, such as heat transfer, electric/magnetic field, and diffusion. This article provides a practical overview of these LBM models and implementation details for external force, initial condition, and boundary condition. Moreover, recent LBM applications in various microfluidic situations have been reviewed, including microscopic gaseous flows, surface wettability and solid-liquid interfacial slip, multiphase flows in microchannels, electrokinetic flows, interface deformation in electric/magnetic field, flows through porous structures, and biological microflows. These simulations show some examples of the capability and efficiency of LBM in computational microfluidics.},

abstract = {We present a framework using the Tensor Train decomposition (TT) to accurately and efficiently solve volume and boundary integral equations in three dimensions. We describe how the TT decomposition can be used as a hierarchical compression and inversion scheme for matrices arising from the discretization of integral equations. For a broad range of problems, computational and storage costs of the inversion scheme are extremely modest $O(\log N)$ and once the inverse is computed, it can be applied in $O(N\log N)$. We analyze the TT ranks for hierarchically low rank matrices and discuss its relationship to commonly used hierarchical compression techniques such as FMM, HSS, and wavelets. We prove that the TT ranks are bounded for translation-invariant systems and argue that this behavior extends to non-translation invariant volume and boundary integrals. For volume integrals, the TT decomposition provides an efficient direct solver requiring significantly less memory compared to other fast direct solvers. We present results demonstrating the remarkable performance of the TT-based solver when applied to both translation and non-translation invariant volume integrals in 3D. For boundary integral equations, we demonstrate that using a TT decomposition to construct preconditioners for a Krylov subspace method leads to an efficient and robust solver with a small memory footprint. We test the TT preconditioners in the iterative solution of an exterior elliptic boundary value problem (Laplace) formulated as a boundary integral equation in complex, multiply connected geometries.},

Quadrature by expansion (QBX) is a new method for dealing with such integrals, and it is based on forming a local expansion of the layer potential close to the boundary. In doing so, one introduces a new quadrature error due to nearly singular integration in the evaluation of expansion coefficients. Using a method based on contour integration and calculus of residues, the quadrature error of nearly singular integrals can be accurately estimated. This makes it possible to derive accurate estimates for the quadrature errors related to QBX, when applied to layer potentials in two and three dimensions. As examples we derive estimates for the Laplace and Helmholtz single layer potentials. These results can be used for parameter selection in practical applications.},

Specifically, we derive a third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule that provides a set of cubature points scaling linearly with the state-vector dimension. The {CKF} may therefore provide a systematic solution for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems. The paper also includes the derivation of a square-root version of the {CKF} for improved numerical stability. The {CKF} is tested experimentally in two nonlinear state estimation problems. In the first problem, the proposed cubature rule is used to compute the second-order statistics of a nonlinearly transformed Gaussian random variable. The second problem addresses the use of the {CKF} for tracking a maneuvering aircraft. The results of both experiments demonstrate the improved performance of the {CKF} over conventional nonlinear filters.},

The drops contain an n alkylamine that adsorbs onto surfaces exposing carboxylic acid groups and produces surfaces exposing methyl groups. The change in surface energy that occurs concurrent with the formation of an oriented monomolecular film of alkylamine during this process is sufficient to produce a self-propelled movement of decahydronaphthalene drops on the surface. We employed patterning to direct the movement of the drops on the surface, thereby allowing measurements of the relationships between the macroscopic fluidic behavior of the droplets and microscopic adsorption events. Specifically, we examined the effects of the unbalanced surface-tension force and the influences of adsorbate concentration on drop movement. In this latter case, both kinetic and thermodynamic arguments can be applied to describe the system. We compared the predictions from these two approaches by analyzing data from the present system and those reported by F. Domingues Dos Santos and T. Ondarcuhu [Phys. Rev. Lett. 75(16), 2972 (1975)] that exhibited opposite trends in behavior. The present analysis provides insight into the influence of chemical reaction kinetics on adsorption-mediated drop movement (i.e., reactive wetting).},

abstract = {For functions that are best described with spherical coordinates, the three-dimensional Fourier transform can be written in spherical coordinates as a combination of spherical Hankel transforms and spherical harmonic series. However, to be as useful as its Cartesian counterpart, a spherical version of the Fourier operational toolset is required for the standard operations of shift, multiplication, convolution, etc. This paper derives the spherical version of the standard Fourier operation toolset. In particular, convolution in various forms is discussed in detail as this has important consequences for filtering. It is shown that standard multiplication and convolution rules do apply as long as the correct definition of convolution is applied.},

The new algorithm successfully computes generalized Gaussianquadratures in a number of instances in which the previousalgorithms fail. Four applications of our scheme to computational physicsare presented: the construction of discrete plane wave expansions forthe Helmholtz Green's function, the design of linear array antennae,the computation of a quadrature for the discretization of Laplaceboundary integral equations on certain domains with corners, and theconstruction of quadratures for the discretization of Laplace and Helmholtzboundary integral equations on smooth surfaces.\n\n \n {\textcopyright}2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics},

Use of non-standard integral equations, graded meshes, interpolatory quadrature, and compressed inverse preconditioning are techniques that are explored, developed, mixed, and tested on some familiar problems in materials science. The recursive compressed inverse preconditioning, the major novelty of the paper, turns out to be particularly powerful and, when it applies, eliminates the need for mesh grading completely. In an electrostatic example for a multiphase granular material with about two thousand corners and triple junctions and a conductivity ratio between phases up to a million we compute a common functional of the solution with an estimated relative error of 10- 12. In another example, five times as large but with a conductivity ratio of only a hundred, we achieve an estimated relative error of 10- 14. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Quan2009,
abstract = {The three-dimensional, moving mesh interface tracking (MMIT) method coupled with local mesh adaptations by Quan and Schmidt [S.P. Quan, D.P. Schmidt, A moving mesh interface tracking method for 3D incompressible two-phase flows, J. Comput. Phys. 221 (2007) 761–780] demonstrated the capability to accurately simulate multiphase flows, to handle large deformation, and also to perform interface pinch-off for some specific cases. However, another challenge, i.e. how to handle interface merging (such as droplet coalescence) has not been addressed. In this paper, we present a mesh combination scheme for interface connection and a more general mesh separation algorithm for interface breakup. These two schemes are based on the conversion of liquid cells in one phase to another fluid by changing the fluid properties of the cells in the combination or separation region. After the conversion, the newly created interface is usually ragged, and a local projection method is employed to smooth the interface. Extra mesh adaptation criteria are introduced to handle colliding interfaces with almost zero curvatures as the distance between the interfaces diminishes. Simulations of droplet pair collisions including both head-on and off-center coalescences show that the mesh adaptations are capable of resolving very small length scales, and the mesh combination and mesh separation schemes can handle the topological transitions in multiphase flows. The potential of our method to perform detailed investigations of droplet coalescence and breakup is also displayed.},

abstract = {The evaluation of sums (matrix-vector products) of the solutions of the three-dimensional biharmonic equation can be accelerated using the fast multipole method, while memory requirements can also be significantly reduced. We develop a complete translation theory for these equations. It is shown that translations of elementary solutions of the biharmonic equation can be achieved by considering the translation of a pair of elementary solutions of the Laplace equations. The extension of the theory to the case of polyharmonic equations in R3 is also discussed. An efficient way of performing the FMM for biharmonic equations using the solution of a complex valued FMM for the Laplace equation is presented. Compared to previous methods presented for the biharmonic equation our method appears more efficient. The theory is implemented and numerical tests presented that demonstrate the performance of the method for varying problem sizes and accuracy requirements. In our implementation, the FMM for the biharmonic equation is faster than direct matrix-vector product for a matrix size of 550 for a relative L2 accuracy ??{lunate}2 = 10-4, and N = 3550 for ??{lunate}2 = 10-12. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The constants a and b are such that - 1 ??? a ??? 1 and 0 < b ??? 1 so that the singularities of f will be close to the interval of integration. In this case the direct application of Gauss-Legendre quadrature can give large truncation errors. By making the transformation x = a + b sinh (?? u - ??), where the constants ?? and ?? are chosen so that the interval of integration is again [- 1, 1], it is found that the truncation errors arising, when the same Gauss-Legendre quadrature is applied to the transformed integral, are much reduced. The asymptotic error analysis for Gauss-Legendre quadrature, as given by Donaldson and Elliott [A unified approach to quadrature rules with asymptotic estimates of their remainders, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 9 (1972) 573-602], is then used to explain this phenomenon and justify the transformation. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cylindrical blood vessels, ellipsoid platelets and biconcave-shaped deformable erythrocytes (RBCs) are important participants in hemostasis and thrombosis. However, due to the challenge of combining these components in simulation tools, few simulation studies have included all of them in realistic three-dimensional models. In the present study, we apply a recently developed simulation model to incorporate these components and analyze the flow in a thrombotic tubular arteriole, particularly the detailed hydrodynamic interactions between the thrombus shape, RBCs and platelets. It was found that at certain azimuth positions, the velocity drops in the proximity of both the upstream and downstream edge of the thrombus, which is accompanied by a rapid velocity increase in the narrowed region. The RBCs alter the flow profiles significantly from the typical low Reynolds (Re) number flow, and also enhance the deposition of free flowing platelets onto the thrombus. By evaluating the platelet-thrombus interaction and platelet-RBC interaction together, several mechanisms of platelet deposition augmentation are identified. With in vivo data comparison, our model illustrates the potential of future thrombosis studies that incorporate detailed receptor-ligand adhesion modules.},

@article{Cortez2018,
abstract = {We present a variation of the method of regularized Stokeslet (MRS) specialized for the case of forces and torques distributed over filaments in three dimensions. The new formulation is based on the exact solution of Stokes equation generated by a linear continuous distribution of regularized forces along a line segment. Therefore, a straight filament with linearly varying forces does not require discretization. A general filament is approximated by a piecewise linear curve in three dimensions where the length of each line segment is chosen only based on the variation of the force field and the desired accuracy of its piecewise linear approximation. The most significant advantage of this formulation is that the values of the regularization parameter ϵ and the length of the segments h are decoupled as long as ϵ<h so that ϵ can be selected as a proxy for the radius of the filament and h is chosen to discretize the forces and torques. We analyze the performance on test problems and present biological applications of sperm motility based on existing models of swimming flagella in open space and near a plane wall. The results show, for example, that because the forces along the flagellum vary mildly, a flagellum can be approximated with as few as 11 segments of length h while fixing the regularization parameter to ϵ=h/30, overcoming the need for hundreds of discretization nodes required by the MRS when ϵ is small. The filament behaves like a slender cylindrical tube of radius ≈0.97ϵ so that the value of ϵ influences the flagellum's swimming speed. For fixed regularization, doubling the number of line segments does not affect the results significantly as long as the force field is resolved. Examples that require rotlets and potential dipoles along the filament are also presented.},

abstract = {Exact solutions in closed form have been found using the singularity method for various quadratic flows of an unbounded incompressible viscous fluid at low Reynolds numbers past a prolate spheroid with an arbitrary orientation with respect to the fluid. The quadratic flows considered here include unidirectional paraboloidal flows, with either an elliptic or a hyperbolic velocity distribution, and stagnation-like quadratic flows as typical representations. The motion of a force-free spheroidal particle in a paraboloidal flow has been determined. It is shown that the spheroid rotates about three principal axes with angular velocities governed by a set of Jeffery orbital equations with the rate of shear evaluated at the centre of the spheroid. These angular velocities depend on the minor-to-major axis ratio of the spheroid and its instantaneous orientation, but are independent of its actual size. The spheroid also translates at a variable speed, depending on its orientation relative to the surrounding fluid, along a straight path parallel to the main flow direction without any side drift or migration. This ‘jerk' motion obeys a trajectory equation which is size dependent.},

abstract = {The motion of an inertial ellipsoid in a creeping linear shear flow of a Newtonian fluid is studied numerically. This constitutes a fundamental system that is used as a basis for simulations and analysis of flows with heavy nonspherical particles. The torque on the ellipsoid is given analytically by Jeffery [Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A 102, 161 (1922)]. This torque is coupled with the angular-momentum equation for the particle. The motion is then governed by the Stokes number St=rho(e)gammal(2)/mu, where rho(e) is the density of the ellipsoid, gamma is the rate of shear, l is the length of the major axis of the ellipsoid, and mu is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. For low St (the numerical value depends on the aspect ratio of the particle), the particle motion is similar to the Jeffery orbits obtained for inertia-free particles with the addition of an orbit drift so that the particle eventually lies in the flow-gradient plane. At higher St, more drastic effects are seen. For particles oriented in the flow-gradient plane, the rotation rate increases rather abruptly to half the shear rate in a narrow range of St. For particles with other orientations, the motion goes from a kayaking motion to rotation around an oblique axis. It is suggested that, depending on aspect and density ratios, particle inertia might be sufficient to explain and model orbit drift observed previously at low Reynolds numbers. It is discussed how and when the assumption of negligible fluid inertia and strong particle inertia can be justified from a fundamental perspective for particles of different aspect ratios.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 American Mathematical Society.We present a new method for solving the wave equation implicitly in one spatial dimension. Our approach is to discretize the wave equation in time, following the method of lines transpose, sometimes referred to as the transverse method of lines, or Rothe's method. We then solve the resulting system of partial differential equations using boundary integral methods. Our algorithm extends to higher spatial dimensions using an alternating direction implicit (ADI) framework. Thus we develop a boundary integral solution that is competitive with explicit finite difference methods, both in terms of accuracy and speed. However, it provides more flexibility in the treatment of source functions and complex boundaries. We provide the analytical details of our one-dimensional method herein, along with a proof of the convergence of our schemes in free space and on a bounded domain. We find that the method is unconditionally stable and achieves second order accuracy. Upon examining the discretization error, we derive a novel optimal quadrature method, which can be viewed as a Lax-type correction.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the stability properties of explicit marching schemes for second-kind Volterra integral equations that arise when solving boundary value problems for the heat equation by means of potential theory. We show that, for the Dirichlet problem on the unit ball in all dimensions $d\ge 2$, the simplest marching scheme is unconditionally stable. By contrast, it is well known that explicit finite difference or finite element schemes for the heat equation are stable only if the time step $\Delta t$ is of the order $O(\Delta x^2)$, where $\Delta x$ is the finest spatial grid spacing. We also consider Robin boundary conditions for $d=1$, and show that there is a constant $C$ depending only on the Robin (heat transfer) coefficient $\kappa$ such that the simplest first-order accurate scheme is stable if $\Delta t < C(\kappa)$, independent of the spatial discretization. Our estimates involve new bounds for ratios of modified Bessel functions, and for the smallest eigenvalues of real symmetric Toeplitz matrices, which may be of analytic interest in other applications.},

@article{Yan2018a,
abstract = {An important but missing component in the application of the kernel independent fast multipole method (KIFMM) is the capability for flexibly and efficiently imposing singly, doubly, and triply periodic boundary conditions. In most popular packages such periodicities are imposed with the hierarchical repetition of periodic boxes, which may give an incorrect answer due to the conditional convergence of some kernel sums. Here we present an efficient method to properly impose periodic boundary conditions using a near-far splitting scheme. The near-field contribution is directly calculated with the KIFMM method, while the far-field contribution is calculated with a multipole-to-local (M2L) operator which is independent of the source and target point distribution. The M2L operator is constructed with the far-field portion of the kernel function to generate the far-field contribution with the downward equivalent source points in KIFMM. This method guarantees the sum of the near-field & far-field converge pointwise to results satisfying periodicity and compatibility conditions. The computational cost of the far-field calculation observes the same O(N) complexity as FMM and is designed to be small by reusing the data computed by KIFMM for the near-field. The far-field calculations require no additional control parameters, and observes the same theoretical error bound as KIFMM. We present accuracy and timing test results for the Laplace kernel in singly periodic domains and the Stokes velocity kernel in doubly and triply periodic domains.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new version of the quadrature Kalman filter (QKF) is developed theoretically and tested experimentally. We first derive the new QKF for nonlinear systems with additive Gaussian noise by linearizing the process and measurement functions using statistical linear regression (SLR) through a set of Gauss-Hermite quadrature points that parameterize the Gaussian density. Moreover, we discuss how the new QKF can be extended and modified to take into account specific details of a given application. We then go on to extend the use of the new QKF to discrete-time, nonlinear systems with additive, possibly non-Gaussian noise. A bank of parallel QKFs, called the Gaussian sum-quadrature Kalman filter (GS-QKF) approximates the predicted and posterior densities as a finite number of weighted sums of Gaussian densities. The weights are obtained from the residuals of the QKFs. Three different Gaussian mixture reduction techniques are presented to alleviate the growing number of the Gaussian sum terms inherent to the GS-QKFs. Simulation results exhibit a significant improvement of the GS-QKFs over other nonlinear filtering approaches, namely, the basic bootstrap (particle) filters and Gaussian-sum extended Kalman filters, to solve nonlinear non- Gaussian filtering problems.},

abstract = {Aspectralboundaryintegralmethod for simulating large numbers of bloodcells flowing in complex geometries is developed and demonstrated. The bloodcells are modeled as finite-deformation elastic membranes containing a higher viscosity fluid than the surrounding plasma, but the solver itself is independent of the particular constitutive model employed for the cell membranes. The surface integrals developed for solving the viscous flow, and thereby the motion of the massless membrane, are evaluated using an O(NlogN) particle-mesh Ewald (PME) approach. The cell shapes, which can become highly distorted under physiologic conditions, are discretized with spherical harmonics. The resolution of these global basis functions is, of course, excellent, but more importantly they facilitate an approximate de-aliasing procedure that stabilizes the simulations without adding any numerical dissipation or further restricting the permissible numerical time step. Complex geometry no-slip boundaries are included using a constraint method that is coupled into an implicit system that is solved as part of the time advancement routine. The implementation is verified against solutions for axisymmetric flows reported in the literature, and its accuracy is demonstrated by comparison against exact solutions for relaxing surface deformations. It is also used to simulate flow of bloodcells at 30% volume fraction in tubes between 4.9 and 16.9 $\mu$m in diameter. For these, it is shown to reproduce the well-known non-monotonic dependence of the effective viscosity on the tube diameter.},

Seven-line MATLAB codes are presented that implement both methods, and experiments show that the supposed factor-of-2 advantage of Gauss quadrature is rarely realized. Theorems are given to explain this effect. First, following Elliott and O'Hara and Smith in the 1960s, the phenomenon is explained as a consequence of aliasing of coefficients in Chebyshev expansions. Then another explanation is offered based on the interpretation of a quadrature formula as a rational approximation of $\log((z+1)/(z-1))$ in the complex plane. Gauss quadrature corresponds to Pad\'e approximation at $z=\infty$. Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature corresponds to an approximation whose order of accuracy at $z=\infty$ is only half as high, but which is nevertheless equally accurate near $[-1,1]$.},

Our scheme can be summarized as an approximate implicit spectral deferred correction (SDC) method. Applying a fully-implicit SDC scheme to vesicle flows is prohibitively expensive. For this reason we introduce several approximations. Our scheme is based on a semi-implicit linearized low-order time stepping method. (Our discretization is spectrally accurate in space.) We expect that the accuracy can be arbitrary-order, but our examples suffer from order reduction which limits the observed accuracy to third-order. We also use invariant properties of vesicle flows, constant area and boundary length in two dimensions, to reduce the computational cost of error estimation for adaptive time stepping. We present results in two dimensions for single-vesicle flows, constricted geometry flows, converging flows, and flows in a Couette apparatus. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed scheme enables automatic selection of the time step size and high-order accuracy.},

@article{Jiang2013,
abstract = {A system of Fredholm second kind integral equations (SKIEs) is constructed for the modified biharmonic equation in two dimensions with gradient boundary conditions. Such boundary value problem arises naturally when the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved via a semi-implicit discretization scheme and the resulting boundary value problem at each time step is then solved using the pure stream-function formulation. The advantages of such an approach (Greengard and Kropinski, 1998) [14] are two fold: first, the velocity is automatically divergence free, and second, complicated (nonlocal) boundary conditions for the vorticity are avoided. Our construction, though similar to that of Farkas (1989) [10] for the biharmonic equation, is modified such that the SKIE formulation has low condition numbers for large values of the parameter. We illustrate the performance of our numerical scheme with several numerical examples. Finally, the scheme can be easily coupled with standard fast algorithms such as FFT, fast multipole methods (Greengard and Rokhlin, 1987) [15], or fast direct solvers (Ho and Greengard, 2012; Martinsson and Rokhlin, 2005) [17,25] to achieve optimal complexity, bringing accurate large-scale long-time fluid simulations within practical reach. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A finite element scheme to compute the dynamics of insoluble surfactant on a deforming free surface is presented. The free surface is tracked by the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) approach, whereas the surfactant concentration transport equation is approximated in a Lagrangian manner. Since boundary resolved moving meshes are used in the ALE approach, the surface tension, which may be a linear or nonlinear function of surfactant concentration (equation of state), and the Marangoni forces can be incorporated directly into the numerical scheme. Further, the Laplace–Beltrami operator technique, which reduces one order of differentiation associated with the curvature, is used to handle the curvature approximation. A number of 3D-axisymmetric computations are performed to validate the proposed numerical scheme. An excellent surfactant mass conservation without any additional mass correction scheme is obtained. The differences in using a linear and a nonlinear equation of state, respectively, on the flow dynamics of a freely oscillating droplet are demonstrated.},

abstract = {A conservative method of level set type for moving interfaces in divergence free velocity fields is presented. The interface is represented implicitly by the 0.5 level set of a function Phi being a smeared out Heaviside function, i.e., a function being zero on one side of the interface and one on the other. In a transition layer of finite, constant thickness Phi goes smoothly from zero to one. The interface is moved implicitly by the advection of Phi, which is split into two steps. First Phi is advected using a standard numerical method. Then an intermediate step is performed to make sure that the smooth profile of Phi and the thickness of the transition layer is preserved. Both these steps are performed using conservative second order approximations and thus conserving integral Phi. In this way good conservation of the area bounded by the 0.5 contour of Phi is obtained. Numerical tests shows up to second order accuracy and very good conservation of the area bounded by the interface. The method was also coupled to a Navier-Stokes solver for incompressible two phase flow with surface tension. Results with and without topological changes are presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Slender body theory facilitates computational simulations of thin fibers immersed in a viscous fluid by approximating each fiber using only the geometry of the fiber centerline curve and the line force density along it. However, it has been unclear how well slender body theory actually approximates Stokes flow about a thin but truly three-dimensional fiber, in part due to the fact that simply prescribing data along a one-dimensional curve does not result in a well-posed boundary value problem for the Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Here, we introduce a PDE problem to which slender body theory (SBT) provides an approximation, thereby placing SBT on firm theoretical footing. The slender body PDE is a new type of boundary value problem for Stokes flow where partial Dirichlet and partial Neumann conditions are specified everywhere along the fiber surface. Given only a 1D force density along a closed fiber, we show that the flow field exterior to the thin fiber is uniquely determined by imposing a fiber integrity condition: the surface velocity field on the fiber must be constant along cross sections orthogonal to the fiber centerline. Furthermore, a careful estimation of the residual, together with stability estimates provided by the PDE well-posedness framework, allow us to establish error estimates between the slender body approximation and the exact solution to the above problem. The error is bounded by an expression proportional to the fiber radius (up to logarithmic corrections) under mild regularity assumptions on the 1D force density and fiber centerline geometry.},

We begin by converting the original ODE into the corresponding Picard equation and apply a deferred correction procedure in the integral formulation, driven by either the explicit or the implicit Euler marching scheme. The approach results in algorithms of essentially arbitrary order accuracy for both non-stiff and stiff problems; their performance is illustrated with several numerical examples. For non-stiff problems, the stability behavior of the obtained explicit schemes is very satisfactory and algorithms with orders between 8 and 20 should be competitive with the best existing ones. In our preliminary experiments with stiff problems, a simple adaptive implementation of the method demonstrates performance comparable to that of a state-of-the-art extrapolation code (at least, at moderate to high precision). Deferred correction methods based on the Picard equation appear to be promising candidates for further investigation.},

abstract = {We present a simple but effective harmonic density interpolation method for the numerical evaluation of singular and nearly singular Laplace boundary integral operators and layer potentials in two and three spatial dimensions. The method relies on the use of Green's third identity and local Taylor-like interpolations of density functions in terms of harmonic polynomials. The proposed technique effectively regularizes the singularities present in boundary integral operators and layer potentials, and recasts the latter in terms of integrands that are continuous or even more regular, depending on the density interpolation order. The resulting boundary integrals can then be easily, accurately, and inexpensively evaluated by means of standard quadrature rules. A variety of numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique when used in conjunction with the classical trapezoidal rule (to integrate over smooth curves) in two-dimensions, and with a Chebyshev-type quadrature rule (to integrate over surfaces given as unions of non-overlapping quadrilateral patches) in three-dimensions.},

@article{Wang2018,
abstract = {We present a hybrid asymptotic/numerical method for the accurate computation of single and double layer heat potentials in two dimensions. It has been shown in previous work that simple quadrature schemes suffer from a phenomenon called "geometrically-induced stiffness," meaning that formally high-order accurate methods require excessively small time steps before the rapid convergence rate is observed. This can be overcome by analytic integration in time, requiring the evaluation of a collection of spatial boundary integral operators with non-physical, weakly singular kernels. In our hybrid scheme, we combine a local asymptotic approximation with the evaluation of a few boundary integral operators involving only Gaussian kernels, which are easily accelerated by a new version of the fast Gauss transform. This new scheme is robust, avoids geometrically-induced stiffness, and is easy to use in the presence of moving geometries. Its extension to three dimensions is natural and straightforward, and should permit layer heat potentials to become flexible and powerful tools for modeling diffusion processes.},

A finite-difference technique is used to discretize the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a Cartesian grid. To compute flow around embedded solid boundaries, a previously developed sharp interface method for solid immersed boundaries is used. The ghost fluid method (GFM) is used for fluid-fluid interfaces. The model accounts for the effects of discontinuities such as density and viscosity jumps and singular sources such as surface tension in both bubble and droplet simulations. With a level-set representation of the propagating interface, large deformations of the boundary can be handled easily. The model successfully captures the essential features of interactions between fluid-fluid and solid-fluid phases during impact and spreading. Moving contact lines are modeled with contact angle hysteresis and contact line motion on non-planar surfaces is computed. Experimental observations and other simulation results are used to validate the calculations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The broad aim is to simulate the erosion of a porous medium (e.g. groundwater flow) with grain-scale resolution. Our fluid solver is based on a second-kind boundary integral formulation of the Stokes equations that is discretized with a spectrally-accurate Nystr{\"{o}}m method and solved with fast-multipole-accelerated GMRES. The fluid solver provides the surface shear stress which is used to advance solid bound-aries. We regularize interface evolution via curvature penalization using the $\theta$–L formulation, which affords numerically stable treatment of stiff terms and therefore permits large time steps. The overall accuracy of our method is spectral in space and second-order in time. The method is computationally efficient, with the fluid solver requiring O(N) operations per GMRES iteration, a mesh-independent number of GMRES iterations, and a one-time O(N 2) computation to compute the shear stress. We benchmark single-body results against analytical predictions for the limiting morphology and vanishing rate. Multibody simulations reveal the spontaneous formation of channels between bodies of close initial proximity. The channelization is associated with a dramatic reduction in the resistance of the porous medium, much more than would be expected from the reduction in grain size alone.},

One such approach for the heat equation is to first discretise in time, and in each time-step solve a so-called modified Helmholtz equation with a parameter depending on the time step size. The modified Helmholtz equation is then split into two parts: a homogeneous part solved with a boundary integral method and a particular part, where the solution is obtained by evaluating a volume potential over the inhomogeneous source term over a simple domain. In this work, we introduce two components which are critical for the success of this approach: a method to efficiently compute a high-regularity extension of a function outside the domain where it is defined, and a special quadrature method to accurately evaluate singular and nearly singular integrals in the integral formulation of the modified Helmholtz equation for all time step sizes.},

The scheme is intended to work robustly in the lubrication regime when the distance between two particles immersed in the fluid or between a particle and the wall tends to zero. The idea consists in introducing a small threshold for the particle-wall distance below which the real trajectory of the particle is replaced by an approximated one where the distance is kept equal to the threshold value. The error of this approximation is estimated both theoretically and by numerical experiments. Our time marching scheme can be easily incorporated into a full simulation method where the velocity of the fluid is obtained by a numerical solution to Stokes or Navier-Stokes equations. We also provide a derivation of the asymptotic expansion for the lubrication force (used in our numerical experiments) acting on a disk immersed in a Newtonian fluid and approaching the wall. The method of this derivation is new and can be easily adapted to other cases.},

@phdthesis{AfKlinteberg2013,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with computational methods for fluid flows on the microscale, also known as microfluidics. This is motivated by current research in biological physics and miniaturization technology, where there is a need to understand complex flows involving microscale structures. Numerical simulations are an important tool for doing this. The first paper of the thesis presents a numerical method for simulating multiphase flows involving insoluble surfactants and moving contact lines. The method is based on an explicit interface tracking method, wherein the interface between two fluids is decomposed into segments, which are represented locally on an Eulerian grid. The framework of this method provides a natural setting for solving the advection-diffusion equation governing the surfactant concentration on the interface. Open interfaces and moving contact lines are also incorporated into the method in a natural way, though we show that care must be taken when regularizing interface forces to the grid near the boundary of the computational domain. In the second paper we present a boundary integral formulation for sedimenting particles in periodic Stokes flow, using the completed double layer boundary integral formulation. The long-range nature of the particle-particle interactions lead to the formulation containing sums which are not absolutely convergent if computed directly. This is solved by applying the method of Ewald summation, which in turn is computed in a fast manner by using the FFT-based spectral Ewald method. The complexity of the resulting method is O(N log N), as the system size is scaled up with the number of discretization points N. We apply the method to systems of sedimenting spheroids, which are discretized using the Nystr{\"{o}}m method and a basic quadrature rule. The Ewald summation method used in the boundary integral method of the second paper requires a decomposition of the potential being summed. In the introductory chapters of the thesis we present an overview of the available methods for creating Ewald decompositions, and show how the methods and decompositions can be related to each other.},

abstract = {An efficient approach for the simulation of finite-size particles with interface resolution was presented by Uhlmann [M. Uhlmann, An immersed boundary method with direct forcing for the simulation of particulate flows, J. Comput. Phys. 209 (2005) 448-476.]. The present paper proposes several enhancements of this method which considerably improve the results and extend the range of applicability. An important step is a simple low-cost iterative procedure for the Euler-Lagrange coupling yielding a substantially better imposition of boundary conditions at the interface, even for large time steps. Furthermore, it is known that the basic method is restricted to ratios of particle density and fluid density larger than some critical value above 1, hence excluding, for example, non-buoyant particles. This can be remedied by an efficient integration step for the artificial flow field inside the particles to extend the accessible density range down to 0.3. This paper also shows that the basic scheme is inconsistent when moving surfaces are allowed to approach closer than twice the step size. A remedy is developed based on excluding from the force computation all surface markers whose stencil overlaps with the stencil of a marker located on the surface of a collision partner. The resulting algorithm is throughly validated and is demonstrated to substantially improve upon the original method. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We present a new method for the solution of the unsteady incompressible NavierStokes equations. Our goal is to achieve a robust and scalable methodology for two and three dimensional incompressible laminar flows. The NavierStokes operator discretization is done using boundary integrals and structuredgrid finite elements. We use a twostep secondorder accurate scheme to advance the equations in time. The convective term is discretized by an explicit, but unconditionally stable, semiLagrangian formulation; at each time step we inverta spatial constantcoefficient (modified) Stokes operator. The Dirichlet problem for the modified Stokes operator is formulated as a doublelayer boundary integral equation. Domain integrals are computed via finite elements with appropriate forcing singularities to account for the irregular geometry. We use a velocitypressure formulation which we discretize with bilinear elements (Q1Q1), which give equal order interpolation for the velocities and pressures. Stabilization is used to circumvent the divstability condition for the pressure space. The integral equations are discretized by Nystr{\"{o}}m's method. For the specific approximation choices the method is second order accurate. We will present numerical results and discuss the performance and scalability of the method in two dimensions.},

abstract = {We investigate three-dimensional flagellar swimming in a fluid with a sparse network of stationary obstacles or fibres. The Brinkman equation is used to model the average fluid flow where a flow-dependent term, including a resistance parameter that is inversely proportional to the permeability, captures the effects of the fibres on the fluid. To solve for the local linear and angular velocities that are coupled to the flagellar motion, we extend the method of regularized Brinkmanlets to incorporate a Kirchhoff rod, discretized as point forces and torques along a centreline. Representing a flagellum as a Kirchhoff rod, we investigate emergent waveforms for different preferred strain and twist functions. Since the Kirchhoff rod formulation allows for out-of-plane motion, in addition to studying a preferred planar sine wave configuration, we also study a preferred helical configuration. Our numerical method is validated by comparing results to asymptotic swimming speeds derived for an infinite-length cylinder propagating planar or helical waves. Similar to the asymptotic analysis for both planar and helical bending, we observe that with small amplitude bending, swimming speed is always enhanced relative to the case with no fibres in the fluid (Stokes) as the resistance parameter is increased. For regimes not accounted for with asymptotic analysis, i.e. large amplitude planar and helical bending, our model results show a non-monotonic change in swimming speed with respect to the resistance parameter; a maximum swimming speed is observed when the resistance parameter is near one. The non-monotonic behaviour is due to the emergent waveforms; as the resistance parameter increases, the swimmer becomes incapable of achieving the amplitude of its preferred configuration. We also show how simulation results of slower swimming speeds for larger resistance parameters are actually consistent with the asymptotic swimming speeds if work in the system is fixed.},

abstract = {In this work we present a new mixed markers and volume-of-fluid (VOF) algorithm for the reconstruction and advection of interfaces in the two-dimensional space. The interface is described by using both the volume fraction function C, as in VOF methods, and surface markers, which locate the interface within the computational cells. The C field and the markers are advected by following the streamlines. New markers are determined by computing the intersections of the advected interface with the grid lines, then other markers are added inside each cut cell to conserve the volume fraction C. A smooth motion of the interface is obtained, typical of the marker approach, with a good volume conservation, as in standard VOF methods. In this article we consider a few typical two-dimensional tests and compare the results of the mixed algorithm with those obtained with VOF methods. Translations, rotations and vortex tests are performed showing that many problems of the VOF technique can be solved and a good accuracy in the geometrical motion and mass conservation can be achieved.

However, often a weakly-singular kernel arises, in which case specialized quadratures that modify the matrix entries near the diagonal are needed to reach a high accuracy. We describe the construction of four different quadratures which handle logarithmically-singular kernels. Only smooth boundaries are considered, but some of the techniques extend straightforwardly to the case of corners. Three are modifications of the global periodic trapezoid rule, due to Kapur-Rokhlin, to Alpert, and to Kress. The fourth is a modification to a quadrature based on Gauss-Legendre panels due to Kolm-Rokhlin; this formulation allows adaptivity. We compare in numerical experiments the convergence of the four schemes in various settings, including low- and high-frequency planar Helmholtz problems, and 3D axisymmetric Laplace problems. We also find striking differences in performance in an iterative setting. We summarize the relative advantages of the schemes.},

Second, we present an architectural innovation called active memory that enables very fast atomic operations in a shared-memory multiprocessor. Third, we use execution-driven simulation to quantitatively compare the performance of a variety of synchronization mechanisms based on both existing hardware techniques and active memory operations.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Allergen-specific IgE antibodies are implicated in allergic diseases while allergen-specific IgG antibodies have been proposed to prevent allergic reactions. The objective for this study was to study whether the immune response (IgG and IgG4) to peanut differs in IgE-sensitized and non-sensitized young children. METHODS: A total of 239 children have been followed prospectively from birth to 5 yr of age. The levels of IgG and IgG4 to peanut, Ara h 2, and Ara h 8 were analyzed at 2 and 5 yr of age and related to IgE sensitization and peanut consumption. RESULTS: The levels of peanut-specific IgG and IgG4 were significantly higher in peanut-sensitized children at 2 and 5 yr of age when compared with non-sensitized children and children sensitized to other food/inhalant allergens. A strong correlation was seen between levels of peanut-specific IgG/IgG4-ratios and peanut-specific IgE at 5 yr of age. Children avoiding peanuts, a subgroup of the peanut sensitized, had statistically significant higher levels of IgE to peanut and a tendency of higher IgG and IgG4 levels to peanut. In the avoidance group, significant correlations between IgE and IgG/IgG4 to peanut were found compared with children eating peanuts. CONCLUSION: Peanut-specific IgG or IgG4 levels were elevated in peanut-sensitized children especially those avoiding peanuts. In our study, IgG and IgG4 do not seem to indicate tolerance or protection from sensitization.},

abstract = {A level-set continuum surface force method is presented to compute two-phase flows with insoluble surfactant. Our method recasts the Navier–Stokes equations for a two-phase flow with insoluble surfactant as “one-fluid” formulation. Interfacial transport and interfacial jump conditions are treated using the level-set method and the discrete Dirac function. Based on the density-weighted projection method, a stable semi-implicit scheme is used to decouple the velocity components in solving the regularized Navier–Stokes equations. It allows numerical simulations for a wide range of viscosity ratios and density ratios. Numerical simulations on single drop deformation in a 2D shear flow are presented. Simulations on two drop interaction shows that surfactants can play a critical role in preventing drop coalescence. A fully 3D simulation demonstrating the physical interactions of multiple surfactant-laden drops is presented.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an immersed boundary method for simulating moving contact lines with surfactant. The governing equations are the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the usual mixture of Eulerian fluid variables and Lagrangian interfacial markers. The immersed boundary force has two components: one from the nonhomogeneous surface tension determined by the distribution of surfactant along the fluid interface, and the other from unbalanced Young's force at the moving contact lines. An artificial tangential velocity has been added to the Lagrangian markers to ensure that the markers are uniformly distributed at all times. The corresponding modified surfactant equation is solved in a way such that the total surfactant mass is conserved. Numerical experiments including convergence analysis are carefully conducted. The effect of the surfactant on the motion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drops are investigated in detail.},

abstract = {With its roots in kinetic theory and the cellular automaton concept, the lattice-Boltzmann (LB) equation can be used to obtain continuum flow quantities from simple and local update rules based on particle interactions. The simplicity of formulation and its versatility explain the rapid expansion of the LB method to applications in complex and multiscale flows. We review many significant developments over the past decade with specific examples. Some of the most active developments include the entropic LB method and the application of the LB method to turbulent flow, multiphase flow, and deformable particle and fiber suspensions. Hybrid methods based on the combination of the Eulerian lattice with a Lagrangian grid system for the simulation of moving deformable boundaries show promise for more efficient applications to a broader class of problems. We also discuss higher-order boundary conditions and the simulation of microchannel flow with finite Knudsen number. Additionally, the remarkable scalability of the LB method for parallel processing is shown with examples. Teraflop simulations with the LB method are routine, and there is no doubt that this method will be one of the first candidates for petaflop computational fluid dynamics in the near future.},

abstract = {We introduce an efficient algorithm, called partition of unity extension or PUX, to construct an extension of desired regularity of a function given on a complex multiply connected domain in $2D$. Function extension plays a fundamental role in extending the applicability of boundary integral methods to inhomogeneous partial differential equations with embedded domain techniques. Overlapping partitions are placed along the boundaries, and a local extension of the function is computed on each patch using smooth radial basis functions; a trivially parallel process. A partition of unity method blends the local extrapolations into a global one, where weight functions impose compact support. The regularity of the extended function can be controlled by the construction of the partition of unity function. We evaluate the performance of the PUX method in the context of solving the Poisson equation on multiply connected domains using a boundary integral method and a spectral solver. With a suitable choice of parameters the error converges as a tenth order method down to $10^{-14}$.},

abstract = {A second-kind integral equation for the tractions on a rigid body moving in a Stokesian fluid is established using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and an integral equation for a double-layer density. A second-order collocation method based on the trapezoidal rule is applied to the integral equation after appropriate singularity reduction. For translating prolate spheroids with various aspect ratios, the scheme is used to explore the effects of the choice of completion flow on the error in the numerical solution, as well as the condition number of the discretized integral operator. The approach is applied to obtain the velocity and viscous dissipation of rotating helices of circular cross-section. These results are compared with both local and non-local slender-body theories. Motivated by the design of artificial micro-swimmers, similar computations are performed on previously unstudied helices of non-circular cross-section to determine the dependence of the velocity and propulsive efficiency on the cross-section aspect ratio and orientation. Overall, we find that this formulation provides a stable numerical approach with which to solve the flow problem while simultaneously obtaining the surface tractions and that the appropriate choice of completion flow provides both increased accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, this approach naturally avails itself to known fast summation techniques and higher-order quadrature schemes.},

We show that the true coordinate of a relativistic spinning particle is its naive, common coordinate $\r$. Concrete calculations are performed up to second order in spin included. A simple derivation is presented for the gravitational spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions of a relativistic particle. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment (GM), a specific spin effect in general relativity. It is shown that for the Kerr black hole the gravimagnetic ratio, i.e., the coefficient at the GM, equals unity (just as for the charged Kerr hole the gyromagnetic ratio equals two). The equations of motion obtained for relativistic spinning particle in external gravitational field differ essentially from the Papapetrou equations.},

abstract = {We present a fast, high-order accurate and adaptive boundary integral scheme for solving the Stokes equations in complex---possibly nonsmooth---geometries in two dimensions. The key ingredient is a set of panel quadrature rules capable of evaluating weakly-singular, nearly-singular and hyper-singular integrals to high accuracy. Near-singular integral evaluation, in particular, is done using an extension of the scheme developed in J.$\sim$Helsing and R.$\sim$Ojala, {\it J. Comput. Phys.} {\bf 227} (2008) 2899--2921. The boundary of the given geometry is ``panelized'' automatically to achieve user-prescribed precision. We show that this adaptive panel refinement procedure works well in practice even in the case of complex geometries with large number of corners. In one example, for instance, a model 2D vascular network with 378 corners required less than 200K discretization points to obtain a 9-digit solution accuracy.},

It exploits the smoothness of the layer potential by forming locally-valid expansion which are then evaluated to compute the near or on-surface value of the integral. Recent work towards coupling of a Fast Multipole Method (FMM) to QBX yielded a first step towards the rapid evaluation of such integrals (and the solution of related integral equations), albeit with only empirically understood error behavior. In this paper, we improve upon this approach with a modified algorithm for which we give a comprehensive analysis of error and cost in the case of the Laplace equation in two dimensions. For the same levels of (user-specified) accuracy, the new algorithm empirically has cost-per-accuracy comparable to prior approaches. We provide experimental results to demonstrate scalability and numerical accuracy.},

abstract = {We introduce a regularization method that gives a smooth formulation for the fundamental solution to Stokes flow driven by an infinite, triply-periodic array of point forces. With this formulation, the velocity at any spatial location may be calculated, including at and very near the point forces; these locations typically lead to numerical difficulties due to the singularity within the Stokeslet when using other methods. For computational efficiency, we build upon previous methods in which the periodic Stokeslet is split into two rapidly decaying sums, one in physical space and one in reciprocal, or Fourier, space. We present two validation studies of our method. First, we compute the drag coefficient for periodic arrays of spheres with a variety of concentrations of sphere packings; and second, we prescribe a force density onto a periodic array of spheres, compute the resulting nearby velocity field, and compare these velocities to those computed using an immersed boundary method formulation. The drag coefficients computed with our method are within 0.63% of previously published values. The velocity field comparison shows a relative error of about 0.18% in the L2-norm. We then apply our numerical method to a periodic arrangement of sinusoidal swimmers. By systematically varying their spacing in three directions, we are able to explore how their spacing affects their collective swimming speed.},

Moreover, it applies to boundary integrals with singular, weakly singular, and hypersingular kernels. Our work builds upon Quadrature by Expansion (QBX), which approximates the potential by an analytic expansion in the neighborhood of each expansion center. In contrast, we use a sum of fundamental solutions lying on a ring enclosing the neighborhood, and solve a small dense linear system for their coefficients to match the potential on a smaller concentric ring. We test the new method with Laplace, Helmholtz, Yukawa, Stokes, and Navier (elastostatic) kernels in two dimensions (2D) using adaptive, panel-based boundary quadratures on smooth and corner domains. Advantages of the algorithm include its relative simplicity of implementation, immediate extension to new kernels, dimension-independence (allowing simple generalization to 3D), and compatibility with fast algorithms such as the kernel-independent FMM.},

abstract = {We address the problem of computing the hydrodynamic forces and torques among $N$ solid spherical particles moving with given rotational and translational velocities in Stokes flow. We consider the original fluid–particle model without introducing new hypotheses or models. Our method includes the singular lubrication interactions which may occur when some particles come close to one another. The main new feature is that short-range interactions are propagated to the whole flow, including accurately the many-body lubrication interactions. The method builds on a pre-existing fluid solver and is flexible with respect to the choice of this solver. The error is the error generated by the fluid solver when computing non-singular flows (i.e. with negligible short-range interactions). Therefore, only a small number of degrees of freedom are required and we obtain very accurate simulations within a reasonable computational cost. Our method is closely related to a method proposed by Sangani & Mo ( Phys. Fluids , vol. 6, 1994, pp. 1653–1662) but, in contrast with the latter, it does not require parameter tuning. We compare our method with the Stokesian dynamics of Durlofsky et al. ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 180, 1987, pp. 21–49) and show the higher accuracy of the former (both by analysis and by numerical experiments).},

abstract = {The common numerical problem in Bayesian analysis is the numerical integration of the posterior. In high dimensions, this problem becomes too formidable for fixed quadrature methods, and Monte Carlo integration is the usual approach. Through the use of modal standardization and a spherical-radial transformation, we reparameterize in terms of a radius r and point z on the surface of the sphere in d dimensions. We propose two types of methods for spherical-radial integration. A completely randomized method uses randomly placed abscissas for the radial integration and for the sphere surface. A mixed method uses fixed quadrature (i.e., Simpson's rule) on the radius and randomized spherical integration. The mixed methods show superior accuracy in comparisons, require little or no assumptions, and provide diagnostics to detect difficult problems. Moreover, if the posterior is close to the multivariate normal, then the mixed methods can give remarkable accuracy.},

abstract = {In a previous study {[}M. Hameed , J. Fluid Mech. 594, 307 (2008)] the authors investigated the influence of insoluble surfactant on the evolution of a stretched, inviscid bubble surrounded by a viscous fluid via direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations, and showed that the presence of surfactant can cause the bubble to contract and form a quasisteady slender thread connecting parent bubbles, instead of proceeding directly toward pinch-off as occurs for a surfactant-free bubble. Insoluble surfactant significantly retards pinch-off and the thread is stabilized by a balance between internal pressure and reduced capillary pressure due to a high concentration of surfactant that develops during the initial stage of contraction. In the present study we investigate the influence of surfactant solubility on thread formation. The adsorption-desorption kinetics for solubility is in the diffusion controlled regime. A long-wave model for the evolution of a capillary jet is also studied in the Stokes flow limit, and shows dynamics that are similar to those of the evolving bubble. With soluble surfactant, depending on parameter values, a slender thread forms but can pinch-off later due to exchange of surfactant between the interface and exterior bulk flow.},

abstract = {The Brinkman equations of fluid motion are a model of flows in a porous medium. We develop the exact solution of the Brinkman equations for three-dimensional incompressible flow driven by regularized forces. Two different approaches to the regularization are discussed and compared on test problems. The regularized Brinkman model is also applied to the unsteady Stokes equation for oscillatory flows since the latter leads to the Brinkman equations with complex permeability parameter. We provide validation studies of the method based on the flow and drag of a solid sphere translating in a Brinkman medium and the flow inside a cylindrical channel of circular cross-section. We present a numerical example of a swimming organism in a Brinkman flow which shows that the maximum swimming speed is obtained with a small but non-zero value of the porosity. We also demonstrate that unsteady Stokes flows with oscillatory forcing fall within the same framework and are computed with the same method by applying it to the motion of the oscillating feeding appendage of a copepod. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Ascher1995,
abstract = {Implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes have been widely used, especially in conjunction with spectral methods, for the time integration of spatially discretized partial differential equations (PDEs) of diffusion-convection type. Typically, an implicit scheme is used for the diffusion term and an explicit scheme is used for the convection term. Reaction-diffusion problems can also be approximated in this manner. In this work we systematically analyze the performance of such schemes, propose improved new schemes, and pay particular attention to their relative performance in the context of fast multigrid algorithms and of aliasing reduction for spectral methods. For the prototype linear advection-diffusion equation, a stability analysis for first-, second-, third-, and fourth-order multistep IMEX schemes is performed. Stable schemes permitting large time steps for a wide variety of problems and yielding appropriate decay of high frequency error modes are identified. Numerical experiments demonstrate that weak decay of high frequency modes can lead to extra iterations on the finest grid when using multigrid computations with finite difference spatial discretization, and to aliasing when using spectral collocation for spatial discretization. When this behavior occurs, use of weakly damping schemes such as the popular combination of Crank-Nicolson with second-order Adams-Bashforth is discouraged and better alternatives are proposed. Our findings are demonstrated on several examples.},

abstract = {Two fundamental difficulties are encountered in the numerical evaluation of time-dependent layer potentials. One is the quadratic cost of history dependence, which has been successfully addressed by splitting the potentials into two parts - a local part that contains the most recent contributions and a history part that contains the contributions from all earlier times. The history part is smooth, easily discretized using high-order quadratures, and straightforward to compute using a variety of fast algorithms. The local part, however, involves complicated singularities in the underlying Green's function. Existing methods, based on exchanging the order of integration in space and time, are able to achieve high order accuracy, but are limited to the case of stationary boundaries. Here, we present a new quadrature method that leaves the order of integration unchanged, making use of a change of variables that converts the singular integrals with respect to time into smooth ones. We have also derived asymptotic formulas for the local part that lead to fast and accurate hybrid schemes, extending earlier work for scalar heat potentials and applicable to moving boundaries. The performance of the overall scheme is demonstrated via numerical examples.},

abstract = {Models for random porous media are considered. The models are isotropic both from the local and the macroscopic point of view; that is, the pores have spherical shape or their surface shows piecewise spherical curvature, and there is no macroscopic gradient of any geometrical feature. Both closed-pore and open-pore systems are discussed. The Poisson grain model, the model of hard spheres packing, and the penetrable sphere model are used; variable size distribution of the pores is included. A parameter is introduced which controls the degree of open-porosity. Besides systems built up by a single solid phase, models for porous media with the internal surface coated by a second phase are treated. Volume fraction, surface area, and correlation functions are given explicitly where applicable; otherwise numerical methods for determination are described. Effective medium theory is applied to calculate physical properties for the models such as isotropic elastic moduli, thermal and electrical conductivity, and static dielectric constant. The methods presented are exemplified by applications: small-angle scattering of systems showing fractal-like behavior in limited ranges of linear dimension, optimization of nanoporous insulating materials, and improvement of properties of open-pore systems by atomic layer deposition of a second phase on the internal surface.},

Also, series expansions for the drag force to 0(c10) are derived for each of these cubic arrays. The method is also applied to determine the drag force to 0(c3) on infinitely long cylinders in square and hexagonal arrays.},

abstract = {This paper presents a high-order method for solving elliptic interface problems on embedded meshes through a coupled finite element and integral equation approach. The method is capable of handling homogeneous or inhomogeneous jump conditions without modification and retains high-order convergence close to the embedded interface. We present finite element-integral equation (FE-IE) formulations for interior, exterior, and interface problems. The treatments of the exterior and interface problems are new. The resulting linear systems are solved through an iterative approach exploiting the second-kind nature of the IE operator combined with algebraic multigrid preconditioning for the FE part. Assuming smooth continuations of coefficients and right-hand-side data, we show error analysis supporting high-order accuracy. Numerical evidence further supports our claims of efficiency and high-order accuracy for smooth data.},

abstract = {We introduce a fast algorithm for computing volume potentials - that is, the convolution of a translation invariant, free-space Green's function with a compactly supported source distribution defined on a uniform grid. The algorithm relies on regularizing the Fourier transform of the Green's function by cutting off the interaction in physical space beyond the domain of interest. This permits the straightforward application of trapezoidal quadrature and the standard FFT, with superalgebraic convergence for smooth data. Moreover, the method can be interpreted as employing a Nystrom discretization of the corresponding integral operator, with matrix entries which can be obtained explicitly and rapidly. This is of use in the design of preconditioners or fast direct solvers for a variety of volume integral equations. The method proposed permits the computation of any derivative of the potential, at the cost of an additional FFT.},

Our target audience includes postgraduate and final year undergraduate students in mathematics who are keen to learn about the area. The article may also be useful for instructors in mathematics who wish to enliven their classes with references to the application of deep learning techniques. We focus on three fundamental questions: what is a deep neural network? how is a network trained? what is the stochastic gradient method? We illustrate the ideas with a short MATLAB code that sets up and trains a network. We also show the use of state-of-the art software on a large scale image classification problem.

abstract = {The nonequispaced Fourier transform arises in a variety of application area:, from medical imaging to radio astronomy to the numerical solution of partial differential equations. In a typical problem, one is given an irregular sampling of N data in the frequency domain and one is interested in reconstructing the corresponding function in the physical domain. When the sampling is uniform, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) allows this calculation to be computed in O(N log N) operations rather than O(N-2) operations. Unfortunately, when the sampling is nonuniform, the FFT does not apply. Over the last few years, a number of algorithms have been developed to overcome this limitation and are often referred to as nonuniform FFTs (NUFFTs). These rely on a mixture of interpolation and the judicious use of the FFT on an oversampled grid (A. Dutt and V. Rokhlin, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 14 (1993), pp. 1368-1383). In this paper, we observe that one of the standard interpolation or "gridding" schemes, based on Gaussians, can be accelerated by a significant factor without precomputation and storage of the interpolation weights. This is of particular value in two- and three-dimensional settings, saving either 10(d)N in storage in d dimensions or a factor of about 5-10 in CPU time (independent of dimension).},

In this paper it is shown that the old method - a one-dimensional delta function approximation extended to higher dimensions by a distance function - can be made accurate with a different class of one-dimensional delta function approximations.

abstract = {Sedimentation behaviours of an ellipsoidal particle in narrow and infinitely long tubes are studied by a multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). In the present study, both circular and square tubes with 12/13 ⩽ D/A ⩽ 2.5 are considered with the Galileo number (Ga) up to 150, where D and A are the width of the tube and the length of major axis of the ellipsoid, respectively. Besides three modes of motion mentioned in the literature, two novel modes are found for the narrow tubes in the higher Ga regime: the spiral mode and the vertically inclined mode. Near a transitional regime, in terms of average settling velocity, it is found that a lighter ellipsoid may settle faster than a heavier one. The relevant mechanism is revealed. The behaviour of sedimentation inside the square tubes is similar to that in the circular tubes. One significant difference is that the translation and rotation of ellipsoid are finally constrained to a diagonal plane in the square tubes. The other difference is that the anomalous rolling mode occurs in the square tubes. In this mode, the ellipsoid rotates as if it is contacting and rolling up one corner of the square tube when it settles down. Two critical factors that induce this mode are identified: the geometry of the tube and the inertia of the ellipsoid.},

abstract = {This work presents an intermediate resolution model of the hydrodynamics of colloidal particles based on a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation. The particle is constructed with a small set of overlapping Peskin's Immersed Boundary kernels (blobs) which are held together by springs to build up a particle impenetrable core. Here, we used 12 blobs placed in the vertexes of an icosahedron with an extra one in its center. Although the particle surface is not explicitly resolved, we show that the short-distance hydrodynamic responses (flow profiles, translational and rotational mobilities) agree with spherical colloids and provide consistent effective radii. A remarkable property of the present multiblob model is that it naturally provides zero relative mobility at some finite inter-particle distance. In terms of mutual friction, this divergent force accurately represents the "soft" lubrication regime of spherical colloids and permits to resolve the increase of the solution viscosity up to moderately dense systems with volume fraction up to about 0.50. This intermediate resolution model is able to recover highly non-trivial (many-body) hydrodynamics using small particles whose radii are similar to the grid size h (in the range [1.6 - 3.2] h). Considering that the cost of the embedding fluid phase scales such as the cube of the particle radius, this result brings about a significant computational speed-up. Our code Fluam works in Graphics Processor Units and uses Fast Fourier Transform for the Poisson solver, which further improves its efficiency.},

abstract = {A computer program generated 3000 interpenetrating spheres in a cubic container (with periodic boundary conditions which ensured complete continuity at all boundaries) and used a relaxation technique to reduce overlaps. When the average overlap fell below (exceeded) an empirical value, sphere radii were increased (decreased). This simulated vibration caused the nominal solids fraction to increase slowly to 0.6381. Further iterations with a very gradual decrease in sphere radii produced an overlap-free packing with a density of 0.6366. This packing, which is isotropic and homogeneous, is characterized by very few contacts and many non-touching neighbours. The radial distribution function is similar to that obtained experimentally. In particular, the first peak is split into two maxima. ?? 1981.},

abstract = {We derive a Ewald decomposition for the Stokeslet in planar periodicity and a novel PME-type O(N log N) method for the fast evaluation of the resulting sums. The decomposition is the natural 2P counterpart to the classical 3P decomposition by Hasimoto, and is given in an explicit form not found in the literature. Truncation error estimates are provided to aid in selecting parameters. The fast, PME-type, method appears to be the first fast method for computing Stokeslet Ewald sums in planar periodicity, and has three attractive properties: it is spectrally accurate; it uses the minimal amount of memory that a gridded Ewald method can use; and provides clarity regarding numerical errors and how to choose parameters. Analytical and numerical results are give to support this. We explore the practicalities of the proposed method, and survey the computational issues involved in applying it to 2-periodic boundary integral Stokes problems.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the mathematical structure of the immersed boundary (IB) method, which is intended for the computer simulation of fluid–structure interaction, especially in biological fluid dynamics. The IB formulation of such problems, derived here from the principle of least ac- tion, involves both Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, linked by the Dirac delta function. Spatial discretization of the IB equations is based on a fixed Cartesian mesh for the Eulerian variables, and a moving curvilinear mesh for the Lagrangian variables. The two types of variables are linked by interaction equations that involve a smoothed approximation to the Dirac delta function. Eulerian/Lagrangian identities govern the transfer of data from one mesh to the other. Temporal discretization is by a second-order Runge–Kutta method. Current and future research directions are pointed out, and applications of the IB method are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, a traction-based boundary element method is formulated and imple- mented for periodic suspensions. Hydrodynamic interaction of particles at infinity is handled by O'Brien's method (1979), which is suitably modified for the adjoint double layer using the mean field values of the traction and the background flow. After a deflation of the extreme eigenvalue −1 of the adjoint double layer operator, an iterative solution strategy is implemented, which solves for the traction field on the surfaces of a group of near-by particles sequentially. Ewald's summation technique is employed, by expressing the adjoint double layer kernel in two sums, one converges rapidly in real space, and the other, in the reciprocal Fourier space. The imple- mentation is tested on a periodic suspension of spheres and spheroids in simple and elongated face-centred cubic arrays, and proved to be very accurate when compared to established re- sults. New results for the intrinsic viscosities of periodic suspensions of cubes and spheroids from moderate to high volume fractions are reported. Based on the numerical data for suspensions of spheroids, a simple modification of the constitutive equation of Hinch & Leal (1972), which was derived for dilute suspension of spheroids, is reported, allowing the constitutive equation to reasonably fit the numerical data at moderate to high concentrations.},

We consider sums involving stokeslets, stresslets and rotlets that appear in boundary integral methods and potential methods for solving Stokes equations. The method combines the framework of the Spectral Ewald method for periodic problems, with a very recent approach to solving the free-space harmonic and biharmonic equations using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) on a uniform grid. Convolution with a truncated Gaussian function is used to place point sources on a grid. With precomputation of a scalar grid quantity that does not depend on these sources, the amount of oversampling of the grids with Gaussians can be kept at a factor of two, the minimum for aperiodic convolutions by FFTs. The resulting algorithm has a computational complexity of O(N log N) for problems with N sources and targets. Comparison is made with a fast multipole method (FMM) to show that the performance of the new method is competitive.},

abstract = {Loops are the single largest source of parallelism in many applications. One way to exploit this parallelism is to execute loop iterations in parallel on different processors. Previous approaches to loop scheduling attempted to achieve the minimum completion time by distributing the workload as evenly as possible while minimizing the number of synchronization operations required. The authors consider a third dimension to the problem of loop scheduling on shared-memory multiprocessors: communication overhead caused by accesses to nonlocal data. They show that traditional algorithms for loop scheduling, which ignore the location of data when assigning iterations to processors, incur a significant performance penalty on modern shared-memory multiprocessors. They propose a new loop scheduling algorithm that attempts to simultaneously balance the workload, minimize synchronization, and co-locate loop iterations with the necessary data. They compare the performance of this new algorithm to other known algorithms by using five representative kernel programs on a Silicon Graphics multiprocessor workstation, a BBN Butterfly, a Sequent Symmetry, and a KSR-1, and show that the new algorithm offers substantial performance improvements, up to a factor of 4 in some cases. The authors conclude that loop scheduling algorithms for shared-memory multiprocessors cannot afford to ignore the location of data, particularly in light of the increasing disparity between processor and memory speeds},

The algorithm requires only a Green's function evaluation routine for the governing equation and a representation of the source distribution (the right-hand side) that can be evaluated at arbitrary points. The performance of the FMM is accelerated in two ways. First, we construct a piecewise polynomial approximation of the right-hand side and compute far-field expansions in the FMM from the coefficients of this approximation. Second, we precompute tables of quadratures to handle the near-field interac- tions on adaptive octree data structures, keeping the total storage requirements in check through the exploitation of symmetries. We present numerical examples for the Laplace, modified Helmholtz and Stokes equations.},

abstract = {Slender body theory is a commonly used approximation in computational models of thin fibers in viscous fluids, especially in simulating the motion of cilia or flagella in swimming microorganisms. In [23], we developed a PDE framework for analyzing the error introduced by the slender body approximation for closed-loop fibers with constant radius $\epsilon$, and showed that the difference between our closed-loop PDE solution and the slender body approximation is bounded by an expression proportional to $\epsilon|\log\epsilon|$. Here we extend the slender body PDE framework to the free endpoint setting, which is more physically relevant from a modeling standpoint but more technically demanding than the closed loop analysis. The main new difficulties arising in the free endpoint setting are defining the endpoint geometry, identifying the extent of the 1D slender body force density, and determining how the well-posedness constants depend on the non-constant fiber radius. Given a slender fiber satisfying certain geometric constraints at the filament endpoints and a one-dimensional force density satisfying an endpoint decay condition, we show a bound for the difference between the solution to the slender body PDE and the slender body approximation in the free endpoint setting. The bound is a sum of the same $\epsilon|\log\epsilon|$ term appearing in the closed loop setting and an endpoint term proportional to $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is now the maximum fiber radius.},

The method has spectral accuracy in space and the adaptive time-stepping scheme allows for control of the temporal errors. Previously available semi-analytical solutions (based on conformal-mapping techniques) are extended to include surfactants, and a set of algorithms is introduced to detail their evaluation. These semi-analytical solutions are used to validate and assess the accuracy of the boundary integral method, and it is demonstrated that the presented method maintains its high accuracy even when droplets are in close proximity.},

abstract = {The class of eigenvalue problems for upper Hessenberg matrices of banded-plus-spike form includes companion and comrade matrices as special cases. For this class of matrices a factored form is developed in which the matrix is represented as a product of essentially 2?2 matrices and a banded upper-triangular matrix. A non-unitary analogue of Francis's implicitly-shifted QR algorithm that preserves the factored form and consequently computes the eigenvalues in O(n 2) time and O(n) space is developed. Inexpensive a posteriori tests for stability and accuracy are performed as part of the algorithm. The results of numerical experiments are mixed but promising in certain areas. The single-shift version of the code applied to companion matrices is much faster than the nearest competitor. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {We present a new derivation of a boundary integral equation (BIE) for simulating the three-dimensional dynamics of arbitrarily-shaped rigid particles of genus zero immersed in a Stokes fluid, on which are prescribed forces and torques. Our method is based on a single-layer representation and leads to a simple second-kind integral equation. It avoids the use of auxiliary sources within each particle that play a role in some classical formulations. We use a spectrally accurate quadrature scheme to evaluate the corresponding layer potentials, so that only a small number of spatial discretization points per particle are required. The resulting discrete sums are computed in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, where $n$ denotes the number of particles, using the fast multipole method (FMM). The particle positions and orientations are updated by a high-order time-stepping scheme. We illustrate the accuracy, conditioning and scaling of our solvers with several numerical examples.},

@article{Koens2018,
abstract = {The incompressible Stokes equations can classically be recast in a boundary integral (BI) representation, which provides a general method to solve low-Reynolds-number problems analytically and computationally. Alternatively, one can solve the Stokes equations by using an appropriate distribution of flow singularities of the right strength within the boundary, a method that is particularly useful to describe the dynamics of long slender objects for which the numerical implementation of the BI representation becomes cumbersome. While the BI approach is a mathematical consequence of the Stokes equations, the singularity method involves making judicious guesses that can only be justified a posteriori . In this paper, we use matched asymptotic expansions to derive an algebraically accurate slender-body theory directly from the BI representation able to handle arbitrary surface velocities and surface tractions. This expansion procedure leads to sets of uncoupled linear equations and to a single one-dimensional integral equation identical to that derived by Keller & Rubinow ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 75, 1976, p. 705) and Johnson ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 99, 1979, p. 411) using the singularity method. Hence, we show that it is a mathematical consequence of the BI approach that the leading-order flow around a slender body can be represented using a distribution of singularities along its centreline. Furthermore, when derived from either the single-layer or the double-layer modified BI representation, general slender solutions are only possible in certain types of flow, in accordance with the limitations of these representations.},

abstract = {The dynamics of slender filaments or fibers suspended in Stokesian fluids are fundamental to understanding many flows arising in physics, biology and engineering. Such filaments can have aspect ratios of length to radius ranging from a few tens to several thousands. Full discretizations of such 3D flows are very costly. Instead, we employ a non-local slender body theory that yields an integral equation, along the filament centerline, relating the force exerted on the body to the filament velocity. This hydrodynamical description takes into account the effect of the filament on the fluid, and is extended to capture the interaction of multiple filaments as mediated by the intervening fluid. We consider filaments that are inextensible and elastic. Replacing the force in the slender body integral equation by an explicit expression that uses Euler-Bernoulli theory to model bending and tensile forces yields an integral expression for the velocity of the filament centerlines, coupled to auxiliary integro-differential equations for the filament tensions. Based on a regularized version of these slender body equations that is asymptotically equivalent to the original formulation, we construct a numerical method which uses a combination of finite differences, implicit time-stepping to avoid severe stability constraints, and special quadrature methods for nearly singular integrals. We present simulations of single flexible filaments, as well as multiple interacting filaments, evolving in a background shear flow. These simulations show shear induced buckling and relaxation of the filaments, leading to the storage and release of elastic energy. These dynamics are responsible for the development of positive first normal stress differences, commonly associated with visco-elastic fluids that are suspensions of microscopic elastic fibers. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The most popular algorithm for the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) uses the dilation of a kernel $\phi$ to spread (or interpolate) between given nonuniform points and a uniform upsampled grid, combined with an FFT and diagonal scaling (deconvolution) in frequency space. The high performance of the recent FINUFFT library is in part due to its use of a new ``exponential of semicircle'' kernel $\phi(z)=e^{\beta \sqrt{1-z^2}}$, for $z\in[-1,1]$, zero otherwise, whose Fourier transform $\hat\phi$ is unknown analytically. We place this kernel on a rigorous footing by proving an aliasing error estimate which bounds the error of the one-dimensional NUFFT of types 1 and 2 in exact arithmetic. Asymptotically in the kernel width measured in upsampled grid points, the error is shown to decrease with an exponential rate arbitrarily close to that of the popular Kaiser--Bessel kernel. This requires controlling a conditionally-convergent sum over the tails of $\hat\phi$, using steepest descent, other classical estimates on contour integrals, and a phased sinc sum. We also draw new connections between the above kernel, Kaiser--Bessel, and prolate spheroidal wavefunctions of order zero, which all appear to share an optimal exponential convergence rate.},

abstract = {An immersed boundary method (IBM) with second-order spatial accuracy is presented for fully resolved simulations of incompressible viscous flows laden with rigid particles. The method is based on the computationally efficient direct-forcing method of Uhlmann [M. Uhlmann, An immersed boundary method with direct forcing for simulation of particulate flows, J. Comput. Phys. 209 (2005) 448–476] that is embedded in a finite-volume/pressure-correction method. The IBM consists of two grids: a fixed uniform Eulerian grid for the fluid phase and a uniform Lagrangian grid attached to and moving with the particles. A regularized delta function is used to communicate between the two grids and proved to be effective in suppressing grid locking. Without significant loss of efficiency, the original method is improved by: (1) a better approximation of the no-slip/no-penetration (ns/np) condition on the surface of the particles by a multidirect forcing scheme, (2) a correction for the excess in the effective particle diameter by a slight retraction of the Lagrangian grid from the surface towards the interior of the particles with a fraction of the Eulerian grid spacing, and (3) an enhancement of the numerical stability for particle–fluid mass density ratios near unity by a direct account of the inertia of the fluid contained within the particles. The new IBM contains two new parameters: the number of iterations Ns of the multidirect forcing scheme and the retraction distance rd. The effect of Ns and rd on the accuracy is investigated for five different flows. The results show that rd has a strong influence on the effective particle diameter and little influence on the error in the ns/np condition, while exactly the opposite holds for Ns. A novel finding of this study is the demonstration that rd has a strong influence on the order of grid convergence. It is found that for spheres the choice of rd = 0.3$\Delta$x yields second-order accuracy compared to first-order accuracy of the original method that corresponds to rd = 0. Finally, Ns = 2 appears optimal for reducing the error in the ns/np condition and maintaining the computational efficiency of the method.},

abstract = {A fast method is developed to efficiently compute three-dimensional Brinkman flows induced by triply-periodic arrays of points forces and regularized forces. For point forces, we decompose the periodic Brinkman velocity into the sum of two series: one in real space and one in Fourier space. To do the splitting, we create a regularized solution with special decay properties so that both summands will decay in a Gaussian manner. For regularized forces, the same methodology is used to split the regularized velocity, and again, Gaussian decay of the summands is achieved. When there are N forces (N periodic arrays), the overall complexity is O(N2). We discuss different ways to reduce the complexity to O(N3/2) and to O(NlogN). Finally, we present two sets of numerical results. The first validates the computational complexity of the algorithm and the second illustrates how this method can be used to study microscopic flows of organisms in a porous medium. A simple dumbbell model of swimmers is implemented that exhibits a large scale flow that varies based on the number of swimmers and the resistance within the porous medium.},

abstract = {Theoretical and computational aspects of the method of interfacial dynamics for flow at vanishing Reynolds number are considered. The mathematical formulation relies on the boundary-integral representation that expresses the flow in terms of distributions of Stokes-flow singularities over the interfaces. The densities of the distributions are identified with the jump in the hydrodynamic traction due to interfacial in-plane and transverse tensions, the interfacial velocity, or the strength of a hydrodynamic potential. The numerical procedure involves describing the interfaces in terms of interfacial marker points that reproduce the evolving shapes of the interfaces by global or local interpolation; solving integral equations of the second kind for the interfacial velocity or for the density of a hydrodynamic potential; and computing the motion of the marker points while simultaneously updating interfacial fields relevant to the dynamics, including the concentration of a surfactant and the position of interfacial point particles at an equilibrium configuration. Interfaces exhibiting isotropic tension, elastic tensions, viscous, and incompressible behavior are considered. The mathematical modeling of the tensions and bending moments developing over interfaces with a membrane-like constitution is discussed in the context of the theory of thin shells. To facilitate the numerical implementation, the coupling of the interfacial mechanics to the hydrodynamics by means of interface force and torque balances is formulated in global Cartesian coordinates. Recent progress in the implementation of boundary-element methods is reviewed, and areas for further research are identified.},

@article{Chwang1975,
abstract = {The present study further explores the fundamental singular solutions for Stokes flow that can be useful for constructing solutions over a wide range of free-stream profiles and body shapes. The primary singularity is the Stokeslet, which is associated with a singular point force embedded in a Stokes flow. From its derivatives other fundamental singularities can be obtained, including rotlets, stresslets, potential doublets and higher-order poles derived from them. For treating interior Stokes-flow problems new fundamental solutions are introduced; they include the Stokeson and its derivatives, called the roton and stresson. These fundamental singularities are employed here to construct exact solutions to a number of exterior and interior Stokes-flow problems for several specific body shapes translating and rotating in a viscous fluid which may itself be providing a primary flow. The different primary flows considered here include the uniform stream, shear flows, parabolic profiles and extensional flows (hyper-bolic profiles), while the body shapes cover prolate spheroids, spheres and circular cylinders. The salient features of these exact solutions (all obtained in closed form) regarding the types of singularities required for the construction of a solution in each specific case, their distribution densities and the range of validity of the solution, which may depend on the characteristic Reynolds numbers and governing geometrical parameters, are discussed.},

abstract = {The Lagrange representation of the interpolating polynomial can be rewritten in two more computationally attractive forms: a modified Lagrange form and a barycentric form. We give an error analysis of the evaluation of the interpolating polynomial using these two forms. The modified Lagrange formula is shown to be backward stable. The barycentric formula has a less favourable error analysis, but is forward stable for any set of interpolating points with a small Lebesgue constant. Therefore the barycentric formula can be significantly less accurate than the modified Lagrange formula only for a poor choice of interpolating points. This analysis provides further weight to the argument of Berrut and Trefethen that barycentric Lagrange interpolation should be the polynomial interpolation method of choice.},

abstract = {We present a procedure for the design of high-order quadrature rules for the numerical evaluation of singular and hypersingular integrals; such integrals are frequently encountered in solution of integral equations of potential theory in two dimensions. Unlike integrals of both smooth and weakly singular functions, hypersingular integrals are pseudo-differential operators, being limits of certain integrals; as a result, standard quadrature formulae fail for hypersingular integrals. On the other hand, such expressions are often encountered in mathematical physics (see, for example, [1]), and it is desirable to have simple and efficient 'quadrature' formulae for them. The algorithm we present constructs high-order 'quadratures' for the evaluation of hypersingular integrals. The additional advantage of the scheme is the fact that each of the quadratures it produces can be used simultaneously for the efficient evaluation of hypersingular integrals, Hilbert transforms, and integrals involving both smooth and logarithmically singular functions; this results in significantly simplified implementations. The performance of the procedure is illustrated with several numerical examples.},

abstract = {The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is a popular tool to solve Laplace and Helmholtz boundary value problems. Its main drawback is that it often leads to ill-conditioned systems of equations. In this paper, we investigate for the interior Helmholtz problem on analytic domains how the singularities (charge points) of the MFS basis functions have to be chosen such that approximate solutions can be represented by the MFS basis in a numerically stable way. For Helmholtz problems on the unit disc we give a full analysis which includes the high frequency (short wavelength) limit. For more difficult and nonconvex domains such as crescents we demonstrate how the right choice of charge points is connected to how far into the complex plane the solution of the boundary value problem can be analytically continued, which in turn depends on both domain shape and boundary data. Using this we develop a recipe for locating charge points which allows us to reach error norms of typically 10- 11on a wide variety of analytic domains. At high frequencies of order only 3 points per wavelength are needed, which compares very favorably to boundary integral methods. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Platinum electrodes were positioned at the channel ends, voltage was applied, and charged analyte was preconcentrated at the oppositely charged side during continuous supply of sample. The preconcentration was initially studied in a closed system, where an influence on the analyte position from a pH gradient, generated by water electrolysis, was observed. In the open channel, the analyte distribution after preconcentration was evaluated using MALDI-MS with the channel as MALDI target. MALDI matrix was applied with an airbrush or by electrospray matrix deposition and by using the latter technique higher degrees of crystallization in the channels were obtained. After preconcentrating a 1 nM cytochrome c solution for 5 min, corresponding to a supplied amount of 1.25 fmol, a signal on the cathodic channel end could be detected. When a solution of cytochrome c trypsin digest was supplied, the peptides were preconcentrated at different positions along the channel depending on their charge.},

abstract = {We consider numerical algorithms for the simulation of the rheology of two-dimensional vesicles suspended in a viscous Stokesian fluid. The vesicle evolution dynamics is governed by hydrodynamic and elastic forces. The elastic forces are due to local inextensibility of the vesicle membrane and resistance to bending. Numerically resolving vesicle flows poses several challenges. For example, we need to resolve moving interfaces, address stiffness due to bending, enforce the inextensibility constraint, and efficiently compute the (non-negligible) long-range hydrodynamic interactions. Our method is based on the work of Rahimian et al. (2010) [33]. It is a boundary integral formulation of the Stokes equations coupled to the interface mass continuity and force balance. We extend the algorithms presented in that paper to increase the robustness of the method and enable simulations with concentrated suspensions. In particular, we propose a scheme in which both intra-vesicle and inter-vesicle interactions are treated semi-implicitly. In addition we use special integration for near-singular integrals and we introduce a spectrally accurate collision detection scheme. We test the proposed methodologies on both unconfined and confined flows for vesicles whose internal fluid may have a viscosity contrast with the bulk medium. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of treating both intra-vesicle and inter-vesicle interactions accurately. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Target-specific expansions serve to lower the cost of local expansion evaluation, reducing the computational effort from $O((p + 1)^2)$ to $O(p + 1)$ in three dimensions, without any accuracy loss compared with conventional expansions, but with the loss of source/target separation in the expansion coefficients. GIGAQBX is a `global' QBX scheme, meaning that the potential is mediated entirely through expansions for points close to or on the boundary. In our scheme, this single global expansion is decomposed into two parts that are evaluated separately: one incorporating near-field contributions using target-specific expansions, and one conventionally using spherical harmonic expansions of far-field contributions, noting that convergence guarantees only exist for the sum of the two sub-expansions. By contrast, target-specific expansions were originally introduced as an acceleration mechanism for the `local' QBX schemes, in which the far-field does not contribute to the QBX expansion. Compared with the unmodified GIGAQBX algorithm, we show through a reproducible, time-calibrated cost model that the combined scheme yields a considerable cost reduction for the near-field evaluation part of the computation. We support the effectiveness of our scheme through numerical results demonstrating performance improvements for Laplace and Helmholtz kernels.},

Standard Nystr{\"{o}}m and collocation schemes proceed by representing functions via their values at a collection of quadrature nodes. Our method uses appropriately scaled function values in lieu of such representations. This results in a scheme which is mathematically equivalent to Galerkin discretization in that the resulting matrices are related to those obtained by Galerkin methods via conjugation with well-conditioned matrices, but which avoids the evaluation of double integrals. Moreover, we incorporate a new mechanism for approximating the singular integrals which arise from the discretization of weakly singular integral operators which is considerably more efficient than standard methods.

abstract = {A spectrally accurate fast method for electrostatic calculations under periodic boundary conditions is presented. We follow the established framework of FFT-based Ewald summation, but obtain a method with an important decoupling of errors: it is shown, for the proposed method, that the error due to frequency domain truncation can be separated from the approximation error added by the fast method. This has the significance that the truncation of the underlying Ewald sum prescribes the size of the grid used in the FFT-based fast method, which clearly is the minimal grid. Both errors are of exponential-squared order, and the latter can be controlled independently of the grid size. We compare numerically to the established SPME method by Essmann et al. and see that the memory required can be reduced by orders of magnitude. We also benchmark efficiency (i.e. error as a function of computing time) against the SPME method, which indicates that our method is competitive. Analytical error estimates are proven and used to select parameters with a great degree of reliability and ease.},

abstract = {Integral equation methods for the solution of partial differential equations, when coupled with suitable fast algorithms, yield geometrically flexible, asymptotically optimal and well-conditioned schemes in either interior or exterior domains. The practical application of these methods, however, requires the accurate evaluation of boundary integrals with singular, weakly singular or nearly singular kernels. Historically, these issues have been handled either by low-order product integration rules (computed semi-analytically), by singularity subtraction/cancellation, by kernel regularization and asymptotic analysis, or by the construction of special purpose "generalized Gaussian quadrature" rules. In this paper, we present a systematic, high-order approach that works for any singularity (including hypersingular kernels), based only on the assumption that the field induced by the integral operator is locally smooth when restricted to either the interior or the exterior. Discontinuities in the field across the boundary are permitted. The scheme, denoted QBX (quadrature by expansion), is easy to implement and compatible with fast hierarchical algorithms such as the fast multipole method. We include accuracy tests for a variety of integral operators in two dimensions on smooth and corner domains. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Jia2012,
abstract = {In this paper, a novel nonlinear filter named Sparse-grid Quadrature Filter (SGQF) is proposed. The filter utilizes weighted sparse-grid quadrature points to approximate the multi-dimensional integrals in the nonlinear Bayesian estimation algorithm. The locations and weights of the univariate quadrature points with a range of accuracy levels are determined by the moment matching method. Then the univariate quadrature point sets are extended to form a multi-dimensional grid using the sparse-grid theory. Compared with the conventional point-based methods, the estimation accuracy level of the SGQF can be flexibly controlled and the number of sparse-grid quadrature points for the SGQF is a polynomial of the dimension of the system, which alleviates the curse of dimensionality for high dimensional problems. The Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proven to be a subset of the SGQF at the level-2 accuracy. The performance of this filter is demonstrated by an orbit estimation problem. The simulation results show that the SGQF achieves higher accuracy than the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the UKF, and the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In addition, the SGQF is computationally much more efficient than the multi-dimensional GaussHermite Quadrature Filter (GHQF) with the same performance. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This review concentrates on the fluctuations of the velocities of sedimenting spheres, and on the structural instability of a suspension of settling fibers. For many years, theoretical estimates and numerical simulations predicted the fluctuations of the velocities of spheres to increase with the size of the container, whereas experiments found no such variation. Two ideas have increased our understanding. First, the correlation length of the velocity fluctuations was found experimentally to be 20 interparticle separations. Second, in dilute suspensions, a vertical variation in the concentration due to the spreading of the front with the clear fluid can inhibit the velocity fluctuations. In a very dilute regime, a homogeneous suspension of fibers suffers a spontaneous instability in which fast descending fiber-rich columns are separated by rising fiber-sparse columns. In a semidilute regime, the settling is hindered, more so than for spheres.},

abstract = {It is well-known that by placing judiciously chosen image point forces and doublets to the Stokeslet above a flat wall, the no-slip boundary condition can be conveniently imposed on the wall [Blake, J. R. Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 70(2), 1971: 303.]. However, to further impose periodic boundary conditions on directions parallel to the wall usually involves tedious derivations because single or double periodicity in Stokes flow may require the periodic unit to have no net force, which is not satisfied by the well-known image system. In this work we present a force-neutral image system. This neutrality allows us to represent the Stokes image system in a universal formulation for non-periodic, singly periodic and doubly periodic geometries. This formulation enables the black-box style usage of fast kernel summation methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this new image method with the periodic kernel independent fast multipole method in both non-periodic and doubly periodic geometries. We then extend this new image system to other widely used Stokes fundamental solutions, including the Laplacian of the Stokeslet and the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor.},

The traditional sharp-interface Navier-Stokes formulation encounters a non-integrable stress singularity, which is commonly avoided by introducing slip at the contact line. In recent years, diffuse-interface models have emerged as an alternative method. They are attractive in regularizing the singularity in a more rational manner, and in the meantime supplying a means for describing the interfacial motion on the large scale. Although a number of groups have carried out diffuse-interface computations of moving contact lines, a closer inspection shows that some fundamental questions remain to be answered. For example, how can a sharp-interface limit be realized to produce a solution that is independent of the interfacial thickness? How to determine model parameters so as to match a specific experiment? Finally, is it possible to make quantitatively accurate predictions of the moving contact line using diffuse-interface models? Using the Cahn-Hilliard model as an example, we describe these issues and suggest solutions.},

abstract = {The electrohydrodynamics of vesicle suspensions is characterized by studying their pairwise interactions in applied DC electric fields in two dimensions. In the dilute limit, the rheology of the suspension is shown to vary nonlinearly with the electric conductivity ratio of the interior and exterior fluids. The prolate-oblate-prolate transition and other transitionary dynamics observed in experiments and previously confirmed via numerical simulations is further investigated here for smaller reduced areas. When two vesicles are initially un-aligned with the external electric field, three different responses are observed when the key parameters are varied: (i) chain formation--they self-assemble to form a chain that is aligned along the field direction, (ii) circulatory motion--they rotate about each other, (iii) oscillatory motion--they form a chain but oscillate about each other.},

@article{Biros2004,
abstract = {We present a new method for the solution of the Stokes equations. The main features of our method are: (1) it can be applied to arbitrary geometries in a black-box fashion; (2) it is second-order accurate; and (3) it has optimal algorithmic complexity. Our approach, to which we refer as the embedded boundary integral method (EBI), is based on Anita Mayo's work for the Poisson's equation: "The Fast Solution of Poisson's and the Biharmonic Equations on Irregular Regions", SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 21 (1984) 285-299. We embed the domain in a rectangular domain, for which fast solvers are available, and we impose the boundary conditions as interface (jump) conditions on the velocities and tractions. We use an indirect boundary integral formulation for the homogeneous Stokes equations to compute the jumps. The resulting equations are discretized by Nystr{\"{o}}m's method. The rectangular domain problem is discretized by finite elements for a velocity-pressure formulation with equal order interpolation bilinear elements (Q1-Q1). Stabilization is used to circumvent the inf-sup condition for the pressure space. For the integral equations, fast matrix-vector multiplications are achieved via an N log N algorithm based on a block representation of the discrete integral operator, combined with (kernel independent) singular value decomposition to sparsity low-rank blocks. The regular grid solver is a Krylov method (conjugate residuals) combined with an optimal two-level Schwartz-preconditioner. For the integral equation we use GMRES. We have tested our algorithm on several numerical examples and we have observed optimal convergence rates. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We present a series of geometry-processing algorithms required for hedgehog to run efficiently with accuracy guarantees on arbitrary geometries and an adaptive upsampling scheme based on a iteration-free heuristic for quadrature error that incorporates surface curvature.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asthma phenotyping can facilitate understanding of disease pathogenesis and potential targeted therapies., OBJECTIVE: To further characterize the distinguishing features of phenotypic groups in difficult-to-treat asthma., METHODS: Children ages 6-11 years (n = 518) and adolescents and adults ages >12 years (n = 3612) with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma from The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens (TENOR) study were evaluated in this post hoc cluster analysis. Analyzed variables included sex, race, atopy, age of asthma onset, smoking (adolescents and adults), passive smoke exposure (children), obesity, and aspirin sensitivity. Cluster analysis used the hierarchical clustering algorithm with the Ward minimum variance method. The results were compared among clusters by chi(2) analysis; variables with significant (P < .05) differences among clusters were considered as distinguishing feature candidates. Associations among clusters and asthma-related health outcomes were assessed in multivariable analyses by adjusting for socioeconomic status, environmental exposures, and intensity of therapy., RESULTS: Five clusters were identified in each age stratum. Sex, atopic status, and nonwhite race were distinguishing variables in both strata; passive smoke exposure was distinguishing in children and aspirin sensitivity in adolescents and adults. Clusters were not related to outcomes in children, but 2 adult and adolescent clusters distinguished by nonwhite race and aspirin sensitivity manifested poorer quality of life (P < .0001), and the aspirin-sensitive cluster experienced more frequent asthma exacerbations (P < .0001)., CONCLUSION: Distinct phenotypes appear to exist in patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma, which is related to outcomes in adolescents and adults but not in children. The study of the therapeutic implications of these phenotypes is warranted.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Mosby, Inc.

abstract = {Both general and specific results are presented for the sedimentation velocity and the mutual and self-diffusion coefficients in concentrated suspensions of monodisperse spheres. A statistical mechanical analysis of sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium affirms the generalized Stokes-Einstein equation relating the mutual diffusion coefficient to the sedimentation coefficient and the osmotic compressibility. An integral representation of velocities within a homogeneous suspension of particles subject to an external force leads to the mean sedimentation velocity in terms of ensemble averages of nearfield hydrodynamic interactions plus far-field contributions arising from the renormalization of non-convergent integrals. A simpler analysis determines the self-diffusion coefficient. All three results apply to arbitrary volume fractions and interaction potentials. To evaluate these explicitly we assume particle velocities to be pairwise additive and thus determined from the exact two sphere mobilities. Then the equilibrium radial distribution function for hard spheres, available from the Percus-Yevick theory for dense fluids, characterizes the microstructure, in the absence of long-ranged potentials, for low Peclet numbers. The results conform to the known dilute limits and deviate correctly at slightly higher volume fractions. Unfortunately, at still higher concentrations all three coefficients become negative, indicating the failure of pairwise additivity. Nonetheless, the formal approach provides an exact and general treatment of these transport processes in concentrated suspensions. Furthermore the shortcomings of pairwise additivity, which arise from screening due to intervening particles, can be corrected by either an ad hoc mean-field treatment suggested here or systematic inclusion of three-body effects.},

abstract = {A spectrally accurate method for the fast evaluation of N-particle sums of the periodic Stokeslet is presented. Two different decomposition methods, leading to one sum in real space and one in reciprocal space, are considered. An FFT based method is applied to the reciprocal part of the sum, invoking the equivalence of multiplications in reciprocal space to convolutions in real space, thus using convolutions with a Gaussian function to place the point sources on a grid. Due to the spectral accuracy of the method, the grid size needed is low and also in practice, for a fixed domain size, independent of N. The leading cost, which is linear in N, arises from the to-grid and from-grid operations. Combining this FFT based method for the reciprocal sum with the direct evaluation of the real space sum, a spectrally accurate algorithm with a total complexity of is obtained. This has been shown numerically as the system is scaled up at constant density.},

abstract = {Gaussian split Ewald (GSE) is a versatile Ewald mesh method that is fast and accurate when used with both real-space and k-space Poisson solvers. While real-space methods are known to be asymptotically superior to k-space methods in terms of both computational cost and parallelization efficiency, k-space methods such as smooth particle-mesh Ewald (SPME) have thus far remained dominant because they have been more efficient than existing real-space methods for simulations of typical systems in the size range of current practical interest. Real-space GSE, however, is approximately a factor of 2 faster than previously described real-space Ewald methods for the level of force accuracy typically required in biomolecular simulations, and is competitive with leading k-space methods even for systems of moderate size. Alternatively, GSE may be combined with a k-space Poisson solver, providing a conveniently tunable k-space method that performs comparably to SPME. The GSE method follows naturally from a uniform framework that we introduce to concisely describe the differences between existing Ewald mesh methods.},

abstract = {Despite their many advantages over other numerical methods, boundary integral formulations still fail to provide accurate predictions of mesoscale motion in dense suspensions of rigid particles because the nearly singular flow between surfaces in close proximity cannot be resolved accurately. A procedure for incorporating analytical solutions for the lubrication flow within a large-scale boundary integral equation method is shown. Although the method is applied to the case of spherical particles, in conjunction with the completed double layer boundary integral equation, it can be developed further to treat more complex geometries and can be adapted to other numerical techniques. In contrast to other apparently similar approaches, the present method does not resort to effective medium approximations, and in principle retains all the advantages typical of boundary integral approaches. The framework also allows for forces other than those due to hydrodynamic lubrication between particles, provided that they are a linear function of the relative velocity or at least can be linearized; for example, forces due to sub-continuum fluid behaviour or forces resulting from surface chemistry. It is shown using several benchmarks that the relative motion between two particles in various flows is captured accurately, both statically and dynamically, in situations where uncorrected simulations fail. Moreover, the computational effort is reduced substantially by the application of the method.},

More precisely, the solver relies on the standard decomposition of the solution as the sum of a volume integral to account for the source distribution and a layer potential to enforce the desired boundary condition. The volume integral is computed by applying the FMM on a square box that encloses the domain of interest. For the sake of efficiency and convergence acceleration, we first extend the source distribution (the right-hand side in the Poisson equation) to the enclosing box as a $C^0$ function using a fast, boundary integral-based method. We demonstrate on multiply connected domains with irregular boundaries that this continuous extension leads to high accuracy without excessive adaptive refinement near the boundary and, as a result, to an extremely efficient "black box" fast solver.},

abstract = {The ideal agent for targeted drug delivery should stay away from the biochemically active walls of the blood vessels during circulation. However, upon reaching its target it should attain a near-wall position. Though seemingly contradictory, we show that coated microbubbles (ultrasound contrast agents) possess precisely these two properties. Using numerical simulations we find that application of a localized ultrasound pulse at the target organ triggers their rapid migration from the vessel center toward the endothelial wall. This ultrasound-triggered margination is due to hydrodynamic interactions between the red blood cells and the oscillating bubbles. Importantly, we find that the effect is very robust, existing even if the duration in the stiff state is five times lower than the opposing time in the soft state. Our results might also explain why recent in-vivo studies found strongly enhanced drug uptake by co-administration of microbubbles with classical drug delivery agents.},

In contrast to methods based on product integration, coordinate transformations and singularity subtraction, the family of Nystrom methods studied here is based on a local polynomial correction determined by an auxiliary system of moment equations. The polynomial correction is shown to remove the weak singularity in the integral equation and provide control over the approximation error. Convergence results for the family of methods are established under minimal regularity assumptions consistent with classic potential theory. Rates of convergence are shown to depend on the regularity of the problem, the degree of the polynomial correction, and the order of the quadrature rule employed in the discretization.

abstract = {The quadrature error associated with a regular quadrature rule for evaluation of a layer potential increases rapidly when the evaluation point approaches the surface and the integral becomes nearly singular. Error estimates are needed to determine when the accuracy is insufficient and a more costly special quadrature method should be utilized. The final result of this paper are such quadrature error estimates for the composite Gauss-Legendre rule and the global trapezoidal rule, when applied to evaluate layer potentials defined over smooth curved surfaces in R3. The estimates have no unknown coefficients and can be efficiently evaluated given the discretization of the surface, invoking a local one-dimensional root-finding procedure. They are derived starting with integrals over curves, using complex analysis involving contour integrals, residue calculus and branch cuts. By complexifying the parameter plane, the theory can be used to derive estimates also for curves in R3. These results are then used in the derivation of the estimates for integrals over surfaces. In this procedure, we also obtain error estimates for layer potentials evaluated over curves in R2. Such estimates combined with a local root-finding procedure for their evaluation were earlier derived for the composite Gauss-Legendre rule for layer potentials written in complex form [4]. This is here extended to provide quadrature error estimates for both complex and real formulations of layer potentials, both for the Gauss-Legendre and the trapezoidal rule. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the performance of the quadrature error estimates. The estimates for integration over curves are in many cases remarkably precise, and the estimates for curved surfaces in R3 are also sufficiently precise, with sufficiently low computational cost, to be practically useful.}

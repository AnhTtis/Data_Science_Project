In this groundbreaking text, two world-renowned experts present statistical methods for studying such questions. This book starts with the notion of potential outcomes, each corresponding to the outcome that would be realized if a subject were exposed to a particular treatment or regime. In this approach, causal effects are comparisons of such potential outcomes. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can only observe one of the potential outcomes for a particular subject. The authors discuss how randomized experiments allow us to assess causal effects and then turn to observational studies. They lay out the assumptions needed for causal inference and describe the leading analysis methods, including, matching, propensity-score methods, and instrumental variables. Many detailed applications are included, with special focus on practical aspects for the empirical researcher.},

	doi = {10.1145/3490486.3538322},
	abstract = {The tendency for individuals to form social ties with others who are similar to themselves, known as homophily, is one of the most robust sociological principles. Since this phenomenon can lead to patterns of interactions that segregate people along different demographic dimensions, it can also lead to inequalities in access to information, resources, and opportunities. As we consider potential interventions that might alleviate the effects of segregation, we face the challenge that homophily constitutes a pervasive and organic force that is difficult to push back against. Designing effective interventions can therefore benefit from identifying counterbalancing social processes that might be harnessed to work in opposition to segregation. In this work, we show that triadic closure -- another common phenomenon that posits that individuals with a mutual connection are more likely to be connected to one another -- can be one such process. In doing so, we challenge a long-held belief that triadic closure and homophily work in tandem. By analyzing several fundamental network models using popular integration measures, we demonstrate the desegregating potential of triadic closure. We further empirically investigate this effect on real-world dynamic networks, surfacing observations that mirror our theoretical findings. We leverage these insights to discuss simple interventions that can help reduce segregation in settings that exhibit an interplay between triadic closure and homophily. We conclude with a discussion on qualitative implications for the design of interventions in settings where individuals arrive in an online fashion, and the designer can influence the initial set of connections.},

This results in recommendations that are highly similar to the ones users are already exposed to, resulting in their isolation inside familiar but insulated information silos. In this context, we develop a novel recommendation framework with a goal of improving information diversity using a modified random walk exploration of the user-item graph. We focus on the problem of political content recommendation, while addressing a general problem applicable to personalization tasks in other social and information networks. For recommending political content on social networks, we first propose a new model to estimate the ideological positions for both users and the content they share, which is able to recover ideological positions with high accuracy. Based on these estimated positions, we generate diversified personalized recommendations using our new random-walk based recommendation algorithm. With experimental evaluations on large datasets of Twitter discussions, we show that our method based on {\textbackslash}emph\{random walks with erasure\} is able to generate more ideologically diverse recommendations. Our approach does not depend on the availability of labels regarding the bias of users or content producers. With experiments on open benchmark datasets from other social and information networks, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in recommending diverse long-tail items.},

	abstract = {Link prediction methods are frequently applied in recommender systems, e.g., to suggest citations for academic papers or friends in social networks. However, exposure bias can arise when users are systematically underexposed to certain relevant items. For example, in citation networks, authors might be more likely to encounter papers from their own field and thus cite them preferentially. This bias can propagate through naively trained link predictors, leading to both biased evaluation and high generalization error (as assessed by true relevance). Moreover, this bias can be exacerbated by feedback loops. We propose estimators that leverage known exposure probabilities to mitigate this bias and consequent feedback loops. Next, we provide a loss function for learning the exposure probabilities from data. Finally, experiments on semi-synthetic data based on real-world citation networks, show that our methods reliably identify (truly) relevant citations. Additionally, our methods lead to greater diversity in the recommended papers' fields of study. The code is available at https://github.com/shantanu95/exposure-bias-link-rec.},

	abstract = {We propose novel recommendation algorithms to improve fairness in networks. Fairness is measured by how close different nodes are to influencers in the network. To allow for easy comparison of fairness across graphs of different sizes, our fairness measure is normalized to the same measure on a synthetic power-law graph of the same size. We experimented with the Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert graphs and found the latter to be more robust in terms of normalization. In addition to developing a new fairness measure, we propose a new node recommendation algorithm to increase fairness in networks. Our algorithm works by recommending a target node based on the number of triangles between the source and target node with probability P, and with probability 1-P, it introduces weak ties and diversity in the network by recommending nodes using an importance sampling algorithm. This sampling algorithm is based on a polynomial function of the degree of the target node and its distance from the influencer set. Through extensive simulations on three real-world network data sets and comparing seven different algorithms, we show that the algorithm which recommends target nodes with probability proportional to the square of the ratio of the degree of the target node to distance to influencer achieves the best fairness. We show the robustness of the algorithm to different parameter choices and provide insights on when to use the different importance sampling methods based on the structure of the network. We also provide a generalization of our method for disconnected graphs.},

Here we study two well-known algorithms, namely PageRank and Who-to-Follow (WTF), and show to what extent their ranks produce inequality and inequity when applied to directed social networks. To this end, we propose a directed network model with preferential attachment and homophily (DPAH) and demonstrate the influence of network structure on the rank distributions of these algorithms. Our main findings suggest that (i) inequality is positively correlated with inequity, (ii) inequality is driven by the interplay between preferential attachment, homophily, node activity and edge density, and (iii) inequity is driven by the interplay between homophily and minority size. In particular, these two algorithms reduce, replicate and amplify the representation of minorities in top ranks when majorities are homophilic, neutral and heterophilic, respectively. Moreover, when this representation is reduced, minorities may improve their visibility in the rank by connecting strategically in the network. For instance, by increasing their out-degree or homophily when majorities are also homophilic. These findings shed light on the social and algorithmic mechanisms that hinder equality and equity in network-based ranking and recommendation algorithms.},

In this work, we aim to mitigate the bias learned by GNNs through modifying the input graph. To that end, we propose FairMod, a Fair Graph Modification methodology with three formulations: the Global Fairness Optimization (GFO), Community Fairness Optimization (CFO), and Fair Edge Weighting (FEW) models. Our proposed models perform either microscopic or macroscopic edits to the input graph while training GNNs and learn node embeddings that are both accurate and fair under the context of link recommendations.

We study how the "strength" of the influence of the social media and the homophily ratio affect the probability of the agents of reaching a consensus and how these factors can determine the type of consensus reached. In a simple 2-symmetric block model we prove that agents converge either to a consensus or to a persistent disagreement. In particular, we show that when the homophily ratio is large, the social media has a very low capacity of determining the outcome of the opinion dynamics. On the other hand, when the homophily ratio is low, the social media influence can have an important role on the dynamics, either by making harder to reach a consensus or inducing it on extreme opinions. Finally, in order to extend our analysis to more general and realistic settings we give some experimental evidences that our results still hold on general networks.},

	abstract = {Finding and selecting the most relevant scientific papers from a large number of papers written in a research community is one of the key challenges for researchers these days. As we know, much information around research interest for scholars and academicians belongs to papers they read. Analysis and extracting contextual features from these papers could help us to suggest the most related paper to them. In this paper, we present a multi-task recommendation system (RS) that predicts a paper recommendation and generates its meta-data such as keywords. The system is implemented as a three-stage deep neural network encoder that tries to maps longer sequences of text to an embedding vector and learns simultaneously to predict the recommendation rate for a particular user and the paper's keywords. The motivation behind this approach is that the paper's topics expressed as keywords are a useful predictor of preferences of researchers. To achieve this goal, we use a system combination of RNNs, Highway and Convolutional Neural Networks to train end-to-end a context-aware collaborative matrix. Our application uses Highway networks to train the system very deep, combine the benefits of RNN and CNN to find the most important factor and make latent representation. Highway Networks allow us to enhance the traditional RNN and CNN pipeline by learning more sophisticated semantic structural representations. Using this method we can also overcome the cold start problem and learn latent features over large sequences of text.},

Existing link recommendation methods tend to recommend similar friends to a user but overlook the user's diversity preference, although social psychology theories suggest the criticality of diversity preference to link recommendation performance. In recommender systems, a field related to link recommendation, a number of diversification methods have been proposed to improve the diversity of recommended items. Nevertheless, diversity preference is distinct from diversity studied by diversification methods. To address these research gaps, we define and operationalize the concept of diversity preference for link recommendation and propose a new link recommendation problem: the diversity preference-aware link recommendation problem. We then analyze key properties of the new link recommendation problem and develop a novel link recommendation method to solve the problem. Using two large-scale online social network data sets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the superior performance of our method over representative diversification methods adapted for link recommendation as well as state-of-the-art link recommendation methods.},

Several studies have established the importance of collaboration in enhancing the performance of paired institutions. However, identification of suitable institutions for collaboration is sometimes difficult and therefore institutional collaboration recommendation systems can be vital. Currently, there are no well-developed institutional collaboration recommendation systems. In order to bridge this gap, we design a framework that recognizes thematic strengths and core competencies of institutions, which can in turn be used for collaboration recommendations. The framework, based on NLP and network analysis techniques, is capable of determining the strengths of an institution in different thematic areas within a field and thereby determining the core competency and potential core competency areas of that institution. A major advantage of the system is that it can help to determine and improve the research portfolio of an institution within a field through suitable collaboration, which may lead to the overall improvement of the performance of the institution in that field. The framework is demonstrated by analyzing the performance of 195 Indian institutions in the field of 'Computer Science'. Upon validation using standard metrics for novelty, coverage and diversity of recommendation systems, the framework is found to be of sufficient coverage and capable of tossing novel and diverse recommendations. The article thus presents an institutional collaboration recommendation system which can be used by institutions to identify potential collaborators.},

When these knowledge bases begin to actively bring attention to people and the content they work on, especially as that work is still ongoing, we run into important challenges at the intersection of work and the social. While such systems have the potential to make certain parts of people's work more productive or enjoyable, they may also introduce new workloads, for instance by putting people in the role of experts for others to reach out to. And these knowledge bases can also have profound social consequences by changing what parts of work are visible and, therefore, acknowledged.

	abstract = {Predicting the occurrence of links is a fundamental problem in networks. In the link prediction problem we are given a snapshot of a network and would like to infer which interactions among existing members are likely to occur in the near future or which existing interactions are we missing. Although this problem has been extensively studied, the challenge of how to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge attribute data remains largely open. We develop an algorithm based on Supervised Random Walks that naturally combines the information from the network structure with node and edge level attributes. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function. Our experiments on the Facebook social graph and large collaboration networks show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches as well as approaches that are based on feature extraction.},

In recent years we have witnessed a massive growth of online social networks like Facebook, Twitter etc. So it has become a problem of extreme importance to know the destiny of these networks. Thus predicting the evolution of a social network is a question of extreme importance. A good model for evolution of a social network can help in understanding the properties responsible for the changes occurring in a network structure. In this paper we propose such a model for evolution of social networks. We model the social network as an undirected graph where nodes represent people and edges represent the friendship between them. We define the evolution process as a set of rules which resembles very closely to how a social network grows in real life. We simulate the evolution process and show, how starting from an initial network, a network evolves using this model. We also discuss how our model can be used to model various complex social networks other than online social networks like political networks, various organizations etc..},

	abstract = {Link recommendation, which suggests links to connect currently unlinked users, is a key functionality offered by major online social networks. Salient examples of link recommendation include "People You May Know" on Facebook and LinkedIn as well as "You May Know" on Google+. The main stakeholders of an online social network include users (e.g., Facebook users) who use the network to socialize with other users and an operator (e.g., Facebook Inc.) that establishes and operates the network for its own benefit (e.g., revenue). Existing link recommendation methods recommend links that are likely to be established by users but overlook the benefit a recommended link could bring to an operator. To address this gap, we define the utility of recommending a link and formulate a new research problem - the utility-based link recommendation problem. We then propose a novel utility-based link recommendation method that recommends links based on the value, cost, and linkage likelihood of a link, in contrast to existing link recommendation methods which focus solely on linkage likelihood. Specifically, our method models the dependency relationship between value, cost, linkage likelihood and utility-based link recommendation decision using a Bayesian network, predicts the probability of recommending a link with the Bayesian network, and recommends links with the highest probabilities. Using data obtained from a major U.S. online social network, we demonstrate significant performance improvement achieved by our method compared to prevalent link recommendation methods from representative prior research.},

In an online context, a key question is how link recommender systems may skew the growth of these networks, possibly restraining diversity. To shed light on this matter, we analyze the complete temporal evolution of 170M ego-networks extracted from Flickr and Tumblr, comparing links that are created spontaneously with those that have been algorithmically recommended. We find that the evolution of ego-networks is bursty, community-driven, and characterized by subsequent phases of explosive diameter increase, slight shrinking, and stabilization. Recommendations favor popular and well-connected nodes, limiting the diameter expansion. With a matching experiment aimed at detecting causal relationships from observational data, we find that the bias introduced by the recommendations fosters global diversity in the process of neighbor selection. Last, with two link prediction experiments, we show how insights from our analysis can be used to improve the effectiveness of social recommender systems.},

	abstract = {With the tremendous growth in the number of scientific papers being published, searching for references while writing a scientific paper is a time-consuming process. A technique that could add a reference citation at the appropriate place in a sentence will be beneficial. In this perspective, context-aware citation recommendation has been researched upon for around two decades. Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target paper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of well-organized benchmarking datasets and no model that can attain high performance has made the research difficult. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model and well-organized dataset for context-aware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a document encoder and a context encoder, which uses Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) layer and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is a pre-trained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead dataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context sentences to cited references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge, This dataset is the first well-organized dataset for context-aware paper recommendation. The results indicate that the proposed model with the proposed datasets can attain state-of-the-art performance and achieve a more than 28\% improvement in mean average precision (MAP) and recall@k.},

In realistic settings, this is often not true---the dynamics of an RS ecosystem couple the long-term utility of all agents. In this work, we explore settings in which content providers cannot remain viable unless they receive a certain level of user engagement. We formulate the recommendation problem in this setting as one of equilibrium selection in the induced dynamical system, and show that it can be solved as an optimal constrained matching problem. Our model ensures the system reaches an equilibrium with maximal social welfare supported by a sufficiently diverse set of viable providers. We demonstrate that even in a simple, stylized dynamical RS model, the standard myopic approach to recommendation---always matching a user to the best provider---performs poorly. We develop several scalable techniques to solve the matching problem, and also draw connections to various notions of user regret and fairness, arguing that these outcomes are fairer in a utilitarian sense.},

The next one, called a co-author finding model, models an academic social network as a table that contains different relations between the pair of users. Both of them provide an opportunity for introducing potential collaborators to each other. These two models have been extracted from ResearchGate (RG) data set and are available publicly. RG dataset has been collected from Jan. 2019 to April 2019 and includes raw data of 3980 RG users. The dataset consists of almost complete information about users. In the preprocessing phase, the well-known Elmo was used for analyzing textual data. We call this as ResearchGate dataset for Recommending Systems (RGRS). For assessing the validity of data, we analyze each layer of data separately, and the results are reported. After preparing data and evaluating the collaborator finding models, we have done some assessments on RGRS. Some of these assessments are co-author, following-follower, and question answering relations. The outcomes indicate that it is the best relation in propagating knowledge in the network.

Currently, analyzing scientific impact can be beneficial to various academic activities including funding application, mentor recommendation, and discovering potential cooperators etc. It is universally acknowledged that high-impact scholars often have more opportunities to receive awards as an encouragement for their hard working. Therefore, scholars spend great efforts in making scientific achievements and improving scientific impact during their academic life. However, what are the determinate factors that control scholars' academic success? The answer to this question can help scholars conduct their research more efficiently. Under this consideration, our paper presents and analyzes the causal factors that are crucial for scholars' academic success. We first propose five major factors including article-centered factors, author-centered factors, venue-centered factors, institution-centered factors, and temporal factors. Then, we apply recent advanced machine learning algorithms and jackknife method to assess the importance of each causal factor. Our empirical results show that author-centered and article-centered factors have the highest relevancy to scholars' future success in the computer science area. Additionally, we discover an interesting phenomenon that the h-index of scholars within the same institution or university are actually very close to each other.},

Our mathematical analysis demonstrates the existence of an algorithmic glass ceiling that exhibits all the properties of the metaphorical social barrier that hinders groups like women or people of color from attaining equal representation. What raises concern is that our proof shows that under fixed minority and homophily parameters the algorithmic effect is systematically larger than the glass ceiling generated by the spontaneous growth of social networks.

The design is built on top of scholarly/academic networks, which contains abundant information about scientific collaboration among scholars and institutions. We construct a heterogeneous scholarly network to facilitate the exploring of the behavior of career moves and the recommendation of institutions for scholars. We devise an unsupervised learning model called HAI (Heterogeneous graph Attention InfoMax) which aggregates attention mechanism and mutual information for institution recommendation. Moreover, we propose scholar attention and meta-path attention to discover the hidden relationships between several meta-paths. With these mechanisms, HAI provides ordered recommendations with explainability. We evaluate HAI upon a real-world dataset against baseline methods.

	abstract = {Recently, graph collaborative filtering methods have been proposed as an effective recommendation approach, which can capture users' preference over items by modeling the user-item interaction graphs. In order to reduce the influence of data sparsity, contrastive learning is adopted in graph collaborative filtering for enhancing the performance. However, these methods typically construct the contrastive pairs by random sampling, which neglect the neighboring relations among users (or items) and fail to fully exploit the potential of contrastive learning for recommendation. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach, named Neighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning, named NCL, which explicitly incorporates the potential neighbors into contrastive pairs. Specifically, we introduce the neighbors of a user (or an item) from graph structure and semantic space respectively. For the structural neighbors on the interaction graph, we develop a novel structure-contrastive objective that regards users (or items) and their structural neighbors as positive contrastive pairs. In implementation, the representations of users (or items) and neighbors correspond to the outputs of different GNN layers. Furthermore, to excavate the potential neighbor relation in semantic space, we assume that users with similar representations are within the semantic neighborhood, and incorporate these semantic neighbors into the prototype-contrastive objective. The proposed NCL can be optimized with EM algorithm and generalized to apply to graph collaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NCL, notably with 26\% and 17\% performance gain over a competitive graph collaborative filtering base model on the Yelp and Amazon-book datasets respectively.

Team power hierarchy represents the vertical differences of the possessions of resources in a team. In Science of Science, few studies have looked at scientific collaboration from the perspective of team power dynamics. This research examines how team power dynamics affect team impact to fill the research gap. In this research, all co-authors of one publication are treated as one team. Team power level and team power hierarchy of one team are measured by the mean and Gini index of career age of co-authors in this team. Team impact is quantified by citations of a paper authored by this team. By analyzing over 7.7 million teams from Science (e.g., Computer Science, Physics), Social Sciences (e.g., Sociology, Library \& Information Science), and Arts \& Humanities (e.g., Art), we find that flat team structure is associated with higher team impact, especially when teams have high team power level. These findings have been repeated in all five disciplines except Art, and are consistent in various types of teams from Computer Science including teams from industry or academia, teams with different gender groups, teams with geographical contrast, and teams with distinct size.},

	abstract = {Learning scientific document representations can be substantially improved through contrastive learning objectives, where the challenge lies in creating positive and negative training samples that encode the desired similarity semantics. Prior work relies on discrete citation relations to generate contrast samples. However, discrete citations enforce a hard cut-off to similarity. This is counter-intuitive to similarity-based learning, and ignores that scientific papers can be very similar despite lacking a direct citation - a core problem of finding related research. Instead, we use controlled nearest neighbor sampling over citation graph embeddings for contrastive learning. This control allows us to learn continuous similarity, to sample hard-to-learn negatives and positives, and also to avoid collisions between negative and positive samples by controlling the sampling margin between them. The resulting method SciNCL outperforms the state-of-the-art on the SciDocs benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can train (or tune) models sample-efficiently, and that it can be combined with recent training-efficient methods. Perhaps surprisingly, even training a general-domain language model this way outperforms baselines pretrained in-domain.},

Link recommendation is extensively studied in the context of social networks and of general complex networks due to its wide range of applications. Most of the existing link recommendation methods estimate the likelihood that a link is adopted by users and recommend links that are likely to be established. However, most of such methods overlook the impact that the suggested links have on the capability of the network to spread information. Indeed, such capability is directly correlated with both the engagement of a single user and the revenue of online social networks. In this paper, we study link recommendation systems from the point of view of information diffusion. In detail, we consider the problem in which we are allowed to spend a given budget to create new links so to suggest a bounded number of possible persons to whom become friend in order to maximize the influence of a given set of nodes. We model the influence diffusion in a network with the popular Independent Cascade model.},

Recently, networks with rich side information such as vertex’s label and links between vertices have attracted significant interest due to its wide applications such as node classification and link prediction. It’s well known that, in real world applications, network always contains mislabeled vertices and edges, which will cause the embedding preserves mistake information. However, current semi-supervised graph embedding algorithms assume the vertex label is ground-truth. Manually relabel all mislabeled vertices is always inapplicable, therefore, how to effective reduce noise so as to maximize the graph analysis task performance is extremely important. In this paper, we focus on reducing label noise ratio in dataset to obtain more reasonable embedding. We proposed two methods for any semi-supervised network embedding algorithm to tackle it: first approach uses a model to identify potential noise vertices and correct them, second approach uses two voting strategy to precisely relabel vertex. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle this issue in network embedding. Our experiments are conducted on three public data sets.},

Thus the accuracy of recommendation matters. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Personalized Ranking Deep Neural Network (BayDNN) model for friend recommendation in social networks. With BayDNN, we achieve significant improvement on two public datasets: Epinions and Slashdot. For example, on Epinions dataset, BayDNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, with a 5\% improvement on NDCG over the best baseline. The advantages of the proposed BayDNN mainly come from its underlying convolutional neural network (CNN), which offers a mechanism to extract latent deep structural feature representations of the complicated network data, and a novel Bayesian personalized ranking idea, which precisely captures the users' personal bias based on the extracted deep features. To get good parameter estimation for the neural network, we present a fine-tuned pre-training strategy for the proposed BayDNN model based on Poisson and Bernoulli probabilistic models.},

While research on algorithmic bias in ranking systems has dealt with disparate exposure of products or individuals, less attention has been devoted to the analysis of the disparate exposure of subgroups of online users.In this paper, we investigate the visibility of minorities in people recommender systems in social networks. Specifically, we consider a bi-populated social network, i.e., a graph where the nodes belong to two different groups (majority and minority) and, by applying state-of-the-art people recommenders, we analyze how disparate visibility can be amplified or mitigated by different levels of homophily within each subgroup.We start our analysis on real-world social graphs, where the two subgroups are defined by sensitive demographic attributes such as gender or age. Our findings suggest that the way and the extent to which people recommenders can produce disparate visibility on the two subgroups, might depend in large part on the level of homophily within the subgroups. \% To verify these findings, we move our analysis to synthetic datasets, where we can control characteristics of the input social graph, such as the size of the minority and the level of homophily. Our results show that homophily plays a key role in promoting or reducing visibility for different subgroups under various combinations of dataset characteristics and recommendation algorithms.},

One of the problems in social network analysis is to recover the underlying network structure given information about how nodes in the network interact with each other in the past. In the context of social movie website (e.g. Flixster1), if we know when users rate movies, can we ﬁnd an optimal network of users that best explain the propagation of information which inﬂuences their movie watching behavior? Unveiling such a network would be useful to identify how product information is spread among users. Moreover, it is useful for recommendation of new products to users since recent studies have pointed out that using social network information could potentially improve the accuracy of recommendation. But many movie website such as Netﬂix2 do not have built-in social network to take this advantage. Our contributions are three-folds: (1) We analyze the temporal movie rating data from Flixster; (2) We propose a social network inference algorithm MOVINF, which is more accurate and efﬁcient; (3) We evaluate the inferred network using recommendation (‘Netﬂix Challenge’), which outperforms baseline by 1.41\% and is almost as good as using original social network.},

	abstract = {The increasing growth of online social networks has drawn researchers' attention to link prediction and has been adopted in many fields, including computer sciences, information science, and anthropology. The link prediction in attributed networks is a new challenge in this field, one of the interesting topics in recent years. Nodes are also accompanied in many real-world systems by various attributes or features, known as attributed networks. One of the newest methods of link prediction is embedding methods to generate the feature vector of each node of the graph and find unknown connections. The DeepWalk algorithm is one of the most popular graph embedding methods that capture the network structure using pure random walking. The present paper seeks to present a modified version of deep walk based on pure random walking for solving link prediction in the attributed network, which will be used for both network structure and node attributes, and the new random walk model for link prediction will be introduced by integrating network structure and node attributes, based on the assumption that two nodes on the network will be linked since they are nearby in the network, or connected for the reason of similar attributes. The results indicate that two nodes are more probable to establish a link in the case of possessing more structure and attribute similarity. In order to justify the proposal, the authors carry out many experiments on six real-world attributed networks for comparison with the state-of-the-art network embedding methods. The experimental results from the graphs indicate that our proposed approach is more capable compared to other link prediction approaches and increases the accuracy of prediction.},

While prior work has considered self-selection into one SNS, in this article we ask: how are different SNSs linked by user base? Using national survey data about 1,512 US adults’ social media uses, we build networks between SNSs that connect SNS pairs by user base. We examine patterns by subgroups of users along the lines of age, gender, education, and Internet skills finding considerable variation in SNS associations by these variables. This has implications for big data analyses that depend on data from particular social media platforms.

	abstract = {We propose a new class of game-theoretic models for network formation in which strategies are not directly related to edge choices, but instead correspond more generally to the exertion of social effort. The observed social network is thus a byproduct of an expressive strategic interaction, which can more naturally explain the emergence of complex social structures. Within this framework, we present a natural network formation game in which agent utilities are locally defined and that, despite its simplicity, produces a rich class of equilibria that exhibit structural properties commonly observed in social networks - such as triadic closure - that have proved elusive in most existing models. Specifically, we consider a game in which players organize networking events at a cost that grows with the number of attendees. An event's cost is assumed by the organizer but the benefit accrues equally to all attendees: a link is formed between any two players who see each other at more than a certain number r of events per time period. The graph of connections so obtained is the social network of the model. We analyze the Nash equilibria of this game when each player derives a benefit a{\textgreater}0 from all her neighbors in the network and when the costs are linear, i.e., when the cost of an event with L invitees is b+cL, with b{\textgreater}0 and c{\textgreater}0. For a/cr {\textgreater} 1 and b sufficiently small, all Nash equilibria have the complete graph as their social network; for a/cr {\textless} 1 the Nash equilibria correspond to a rich class of social networks, all of which have substantial clustering in the sense that the clustering coefficient is bounded below by the inverse of the average degree. Additionally, for any degree sequence with finite mean, and not too many vertices of degree one or two, we can construct a Nash equilibrium producing a social network with the given degree sequence.},

	abstract = {People recommender systems may affect the exposure that users receive in social networking platforms, influencing attention dynamics and potentially strengthening pre-existing inequalities that disproportionately affect certain groups. In this paper we introduce a model to simulate the feedback loop created by multiple rounds of interactions between users and a link recommender in a social network. This allows us to study the long-term consequences of those particular recommendation algorithms. Our model is equipped with several parameters to control (i) the level of homophily in the network, (ii) the relative size of the groups, (iii) the choice among several state-of-the-art link recommenders, and (iv) the choice among three different user behavior models, that decide which recommendations are accepted or rejected. Our extensive experimentation with the proposed model shows that a minority group, if homophilic enough, can get a disproportionate advantage in exposure from all link recommenders. Instead, when it is heterophilic, it gets under-exposed. Moreover, while the homophily level of the minority affects the speed of the growth of the disparate exposure, the relative size of the minority affects the magnitude of the effect. Finally, link recommenders strengthen exposure inequalities at the individual level, exacerbating the "rich-get-richer" effect: this happens for both the minority and the majority class and independently of their level of homophily.},

	title = {Triadic {Closure} {Alleviates} {Network} {Segregation}},
	abstract = {Homophily – the tendency for individuals to form social ties to others who are similar to themselves – is one of the most robust sociological principles, leading to patterns of linkage in social networks that segregate people along many different demographic dimensions. This phenomena, in turn, can result in inequalities in access to information and opportunities by members of different demographic groups. As we consider potential interventions that might alleviate the effects of network segregation, we face the challenge that homophily constitutes a pervasive and organic force that is difﬁcult to push back against. The design of interventions can therefore beneﬁt from identifying counterbalancing natural processes in the network that might be harnessed to work in opposition to segregation. In this work, we examine several fundamental network formation models to show that triadic closure is one such process. Our analyses show the power for triadic closure to reduce network segregation at the level of graph structure. We believe that the insights in this work have qualitative implications for the design of network interventions in settings such as online platforms and college dorm assignments, where the designer has a vested interest in mitigating network segregation.},

	abstract = {Link prediction methods are frequently applied in recommender systems, e.g., to suggest citations for academic papers or friends in social networks. However, exposure bias can arise when users are systematically underexposed to certain relevant items. For example, in citation networks, authors might be more likely to encounter papers from their own field and thus cite them preferentially. This bias can propagate through naively trained link predictors, leading to both biased evaluation and high generalization error (as assessed by true relevance). Moreover, this bias can be exacerbated by feedback loops. We propose estimators that leverage known exposure probabilities to mitigate this bias and consequent feedback loops. Next, we provide a loss function for learning the exposure probabilities from data. Finally, experiments on semi-synthetic data based on real-world citation networks, show that our methods reliably identify (truly) relevant citations. Additionally, our methods lead to greater diversity in the recommended papers' fields of study. The code is available at https://github.com/shantanu95/exposure-bias-link-rec.},

However, its spirit is to answer a counterfactual question: “What would the rating be if we ‘forced’ the user to watch the movie?” This is a question about an intervention, that is a causal inference question. The key challenge of this causal inference is unobserved confounders, variables that affect both which items the users decide to interact with and how they rate them. To this end, we develop an algorithm that leverages classical recommendation models for causal recommendation. Across simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more robust to unobserved confounders and improves recommendation.},

However, due to the homophily principle, current algorithms are susceptible to promoting links that may lead to increase segregation of the network—an effect known as filter bubble. In this study, we examine the filter bubble problem from the perspective of algorithm fairness and introduce a dyadic-level fairness criterion based on network modularity measure. We show how the criterion can be utilized as a postprocessing step to generate more heterogeneous links in order to overcome the filter bubble problem. In addition, we also present a novel framework that combines adversarial network representation learning with supervised link prediction to alleviate the filter bubble problem. Experimental results conducted on several real-world datasets showed the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to other baseline approaches, which include conventional link prediction and fairness-aware methods for i.i.d data.},

This article surveys state-of-the-art link recommendation methods, which can be broadly categorized into learning-based methods and proximity-based methods. We further identify social and economic theories, such as social interaction theory, that underlie these methods and explain from a theoretical perspective why a link recommendation method works.

Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater interaction between like-minded individuals, results in polarization. However, we show that DeGroot’s well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize DeGroot’s model to account for a phenomenon well known in social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position, thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals are sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides a framework to analyze the polarizing effect of Internet-based recommender systems that show us personalized content.},

Although a lot of DNA methods have been proposed by researchers from different communities, most of them can only model snapshot data recorded at a very rough temporal granularity. Recently, some models have been proposed for DNA which can be used to model large-scale citation networks at a fine temporal granularity. However, they suffer from a significant decrease of accuracy over time because the learned parameters or node features are static (fixed) during the prediction process for evolving citation networks. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called online egocentric model (OEM), to learn time-varying parameters and node features for evolving citation networks. Experimental results on real-world citation networks show that our OEM can not only prevent the prediction accuracy from decreasing over time but also uncover the evolution of topics in citation networks.},

The aim of this tutorial is to highlight a novel chapter of control theory, dealing with dynamic models of social networks and processes over them, to the attention of the broad research community. In its first part [1], we have considered the most classical models of social dynamics, which have anticipated and to a great extent inspired the recent extensive studies on MAS and complex networks. This paper is the second part of the tutorial, and it is focused on more recent models of social processes that have been developed concurrently with MAS theory.

Social influence network theory advances a dynamic social cognition mechanism, in which individuals are weighing and combining their own and others' positions on an issue in the revision of their own positions. The influence network construct of the theory is the social structure of the endogenous interpersonal influences that are involved in this mechanism.

Models and algorithms for such networks are pervasive in our society, and impact human behavior via social networks, search engines, and recommender systems, to name a few. A widely used algorithmic technique for modeling such complex networks is to construct a low-dimensional Euclidean embedding of the vertices of the network, where proximity of vertices is interpreted as the likelihood of an edge. Contrary to the common view, we argue that such graph embeddings do not capture salient properties of complex networks. The two properties we focus on are low degree and large clustering coefficients, which have been widely established to be empirically true for real-world networks. We mathematically prove that any embedding (that uses dot products to measure similarity) that can successfully create these two properties must have a rank that is nearly linear in the number of vertices. Among other implications, this establishes that popular embedding techniques such as singular value decomposition and node2vec fail to capture significant structural aspects of real-world complex networks. Furthermore, we empirically study a number of different embedding techniques based on dot product, and show that they all fail to capture the triangle structure.},

    "abstract": "One of many manifestations of a deep relation between the topology of the moduli spaces of algebraic curves and the theory of integrable systems is a recent construction of Arsie, Lorenzoni, Rossi, and the first author associating an integrable system of evolutionary PDEs to an F-cohomological field theory (F-CohFT), which is a collection of cohomology classes on the moduli spaces of curves satisfying certain natural splitting properties. Typically, these PDEs have an infinite expansion in the dispersive parameter, which happens because they involve contributions from the moduli spaces of curves of arbitrarily large genus. In this paper, for each rank $N\\ge 2$, we present a family of F-CohFTs without unit, for which the equations of the associated integrable system have a finite expansion in the dispersive parameter. For $N=2$, we explicitly compute the primary flows of this integrable system.",

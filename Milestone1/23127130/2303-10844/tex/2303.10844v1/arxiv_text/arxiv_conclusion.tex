\section{Conclusion}

\revision{This work presented a novel framework to guide empirical performance evaluation of cross-chain communication protocols. We implemented our framework as a tool to conduct the first comprehensive analysis of throughput, latency and relayer scalability of cross-chain communication using the IBC protocol and the Hermes Relayer.}

\revision{Through our findings we highlight the importance of studying the performance of such systems. Aided by our framework we found several issues that hinder the performance of components related to cross-chain communication such as the Cross-chain Communicator and the Cross-chain Data Connector. For instance, using two relayers to relay for a single IBC cross-chain channel decreases throughput by 33\%. In addition, the lack of support for parallel query processing in the blockchain's RPC endpoint causes data retrieval to consume 70\% of the time required to complete 5,000 cross-chain transfers. Those findings bring attention to the impact that those components have on cross-chain performance and present opportunities for the improvement of cross-chain communication protocols.}

\revision{Finally, to assist future research and development, we make available a 158GB dataset of execution logs obtained through our experiments. }

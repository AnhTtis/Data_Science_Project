    "abstract": "Structural or crystal asymmetry are necessary conditions for emergence of zero-bias photocurrent in light detectors. Structural asymmetry has been typically achieved via $p-n$ doping being a technologically complex process. Here, we propose an alternative approach to achieve zero-bias photocurrent in 2d material flakes exploiting the geometrical non-equivalence of source and drain contacts. As a prototypical example, we equip a square-shaped flake of PdSe$_2$ with mutually orthogonal metal leads. Upon uniform illumination with linearly-polarized light, the device demonstrates non-zero photocurrent which flips its sign upon 90$^\\circ$ polarization rotation. The origin of zero-bias photocurrent lies in polarization-dependent lightning-rod effect. It enhances the electromagnetic field at one contact from the orthogonal pair, and selectively activates the internal photoeffect at the respective metal-PdSe$_2$ Schottky junction. The proposed technology of contact engineering can be extended to arbitrary 2d materials and detection of both polarized and natural light.",

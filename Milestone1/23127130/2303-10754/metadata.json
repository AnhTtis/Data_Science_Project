    "abstract": "The exponential decay of lattice Green functions is one of the main technical ingredients of the Bałaban's approach to renormalization. We give here a self-contained proof, whose various ingredients were scattered in the literature. The main sources of exponential decay are the Combes-Thomas method and the analyticity of the Fourier transforms. They are combined using a renormalization group equation and the method of images.",

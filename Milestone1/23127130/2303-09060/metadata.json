    "abstract": "We demonstrate an electrically controlled metal-VO2 metasurface for the mid-wave infrared that simultaneously functions as a tunable optical switch, an optical limiter with a tunable limiting threshold, and a nonlinear optical isolator with a tunable operating range. The tunability is achieved via Joule heating through the metal comprising the metasurface, resulting in an integrated optoelectronic device. As an optical switch, the device has an experimental transmission ratio of ~100 when varying the bias current. Operating as an optical limiter, we demonstrated tunability of the limiting threshold from 20 mW to 180 mW of incident laser power. Similar degrees of tunability are also achieved for nonlinear optical isolation, which enables asymmetric (nonreciprocal) transmission.",

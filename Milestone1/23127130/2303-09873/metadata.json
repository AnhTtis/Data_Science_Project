    "abstract": "Action operads and cloning systems are, respectively, the main ingredients in two approaches for axiomatically constructing Thompson-like groups due to Thumann and Witzel-Zaremsky. In this paper, we prove that action operads are equivalent to cloning systems that admit a certain extra structure, and which we call bilateral cloning systems. In addition, we describe their relation with crossed interval groups and product categories.",

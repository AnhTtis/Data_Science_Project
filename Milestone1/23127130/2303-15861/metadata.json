    "abstract": "In this paper we consider an approach to improve the performance of exponential integrators/Lawson schemes in cases where the solution of a related, but usually much simpler, problem can be computed efficiently. While for implicit methods such an approach is common (e.g. by using preconditioners), for exponential integrators this has proven more challenging. Here we propose to extract a constant coefficient differential operator from advection-diffusion-reaction equations for which we are then able to compute the required matrix functions efficiently. Both a linear stability analysis and numerical experiments show that the resulting schemes can be unconditionally stable. In fact, we find that exponential integrators and Lawson schemes can have better stability properties than similarly constructed implicit-explicit schemes. We also propose new Lawson type integrators that further improve on these stability properties. The effectiveness of the approach is highlighted by a number of numerical examples in two and three space dimensions.",

    "abstract": "We prove an explicit Carleman estimate for the semiclassical Schrödinger operator $P = - h^2 \\partial^2_x + V(x,h)$ on $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, with $V(x,h)$ a finite signed measure, and where $h >0$ is the semiclassical parameter. The proof is a one dimensional instance of the spherical energy method, which has been used to prove similar Carleman estimates in higher dimensions and in more complicated geometries. The novelty of our result is that the potential need not be absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. Two consequences of the Carleman estimate are the absence of positive eigenvalues for $P$, and a limiting absorption resolvent estimate with sharp $h$-dependence. The resolvent estimate implies exponential time-decay of the local energy for solutions to the corresponding wave equation with a measure potential, provided there are no negative eigenvalues and no zero resonance, and provided the initial data have compact support.",

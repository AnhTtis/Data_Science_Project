    "abstract": "In late 2022, OpenAI released a new version of ChatGPT, a sophisticated natural language processing system capable of holding natural conversations while preserving and responding to the context of the discussion. ChatGPT has exceeded expectations in its abilities, leading to extensive considerations of its potential applications and misuse. In this work, we evaluate the influence of ChatGPT on university education, with a primary focus on computer security-oriented specialization. We gather data regarding the effectiveness and usability of this tool for completing exams, programming assignments, and term papers. We evaluate multiple levels of tool misuse, ranging from utilizing it as a consultant to simply copying its outputs. While we demonstrate how easily ChatGPT can be used to cheat, we also discuss the potentially significant benefits to the educational system. For instance, it might be used as an aid (assistant) to discuss problems encountered while solving an assignment or to speed up the learning process. Ultimately, we discuss how computer science higher education should adapt to tools like ChatGPT.",

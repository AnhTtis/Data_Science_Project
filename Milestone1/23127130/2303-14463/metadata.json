    "abstract": "We provide a microscopic approach to describe the onset of radial oscillation of a silver nanoparticle. Using the Heisenberg equation of motion framework, we find that the coupled ultrafast dynamics of coherently excited electron occupation and the coherent phonon amplitude initiate periodic size oscillations of the nanoparticle. Compared to the established interpretation of experiments, our results show a more direct coupling mechanism between the field intensity and coherent phonons. This interaction triggers a size oscillation via an optically induced electron density gradient occurring directly with the optical excitation. This source is more efficient than the incoherent heating process currently discussed in the literature and well-describes the early onset of the oscillations in recent experiments.",

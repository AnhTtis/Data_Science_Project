            Understanding how photoexcited electron dynamics depend on electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interaction strengths is important for many fields, e.g. ultrafast magnetism, photocatalysis, plasmonics, and others. Here, we report simple expressions that capture the interplay of e-e and e-p interactions on electron distribution relaxation times. We observe a dependence of the dynamics on e-e and e-p interaction strengths that is universal to most metals and is also counterintuitive. While only e-p interactions reduce the total energy stored by excited electrons, the time for energy to leave the electronic subsystem also depends on e-e interaction strengths because e-e interactions increase the number of electrons emitting phonons. The effect of e-e interactions on energy-relaxation is largest in metals with strong e-p interactions. Finally, the time high energy electron states remain occupied depends only on the strength of e-e interactions, even if e-p scattering rates are much greater than e-e scattering rates.},

For a pulsed excitation, depending on pulse area and pulse duration, a finite number of phonon wave packets is emitted, while for the case of a cw excitation a sequence of wave packets with decreasing amplitude is generated after the excitation has been switched on. We show that the energy flow associated with the generated phonons is partly related to coherent phonon oscillations and partly to incoherent phonon emission. The efficiency of the energy transfer to the phonons and the details of the energy flow depend strongly and in a non-monotonic way on the Rabi frequency exhibiting a resonance behavior. However, in the case of cw excitation it turns out that the total energy transferred to the phonons is directly linked in a monotonic way to the Rabi frequency.},

As its origin, we identify the kinetic excess energy gained by hot carriers due to absorption of THz light which is transferred during the formation of trions. By performing timeresolved measurements, we have determined the electron cooling time (τ = 70 ps) and estimated the absorption at 7.7 THz (α = 0.3\%). A quantitative model based on the Heisenberg equation of motion explains the experimental observations and can reproduce the data with good accuracy. The present work gives important insights for understanding the trions in van der Waals semiconductors and their interaction with hot electrons driven by THz radiation.},

We present a microscopic theory for the electronic states, phonon modes, optical matrix elements and electron–phonon interaction matrix elements that allows us to calculate the coherent phonon spectrum. An extended tight-binding (ETB) model has been used for the electronic structure and a valence force ﬁeld (VFF) model has been used for the phonon modes. The coherent phonon amplitudes satisfy a driven oscillator equation with the driving term depending on the photoexcited carrier density. We discuss the dependence of the coherent phonon spectrum on the nanotube chirality and type, and also on the graphene nanoribbon mod number and class (armchair versus zigzag). We compare these results with a simpler effective mass theory where reasonable agreement with the main features of the coherent phonon spectrum is found. In particular, the effective mass theory helps us to understand the initial phase of the coherent phonon oscillations for a given nanotube chirality and type. We compare these results to two different experiments for nanotubes: (i) micelle suspended tubes and (ii) aligned nanotube ﬁlms. In the case of graphene nanoribbons, there are no experimental observations to date. We also discuss, based on the evaluation of the electron–phonon interaction matrix elements, the initial phase of the coherent phonon amplitude and its dependence on the chirality and type. Finally, we discuss previously unpublished results for coherent phonon amplitudes in zigzag nanoribbons obtained using an effective mass theory.},

We utilize a suspended and epitaxially grown 2D/metal platform that allows correlated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (nanoARPES) mapping. Spatial localization of MoS2 excitons uncovers an additional EELS peak related to the MoS2/Au interface. NanoARPES measurements indicate that Au−S hybridization decreases substantially with distance from the 2D/metal interface, suggesting that the observed EELS peak arises due to dielectric screening of the excitonic Coulomb interaction. Our results suggest that increasing the van der Waals distance could optimize excitonic spectra of mixed-dimensional 2D/3D interfaces and highlight opportunities for Coulomb engineering of exciton energies by the local dielectric environment or moiré engineering.},

We show how transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) can be used to rapidly and accurately quantify the vast ensemble of shapes of Au NPs in solution within minutes, including the synthesized nanorods, decahedra, and nanospheres. Colloidal solutions containing Au NPs were measured in TAS and their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modes were classified according to the shape, wavelength and number of peaks. Then their excited-state relaxation dynamics were used to ascertain their electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling time constant and frequency of optomechanical modes. TAS can quickly show that an Au nanosphere sample contains a tiny fraction of Au nanorods, whereas steady-state absorbance is totally blind to the presence of nanorods. Additionally, the TAS experiments indicate that the characteristic e-ph coupling time constants in Au nanorods depend on the NPs dimensions at high excitation intensity ({\textgreater} 6 µJ/cm2) which can help identify if there are any elongated Au NPs in Au spheres samples. Finally, optomechanical oscillations formed by NPs breathing modes were observed, providing information related to the average size and monodispersity of Au nanospheres and nanorods.},

As a proof-of-principle demonstration of this new technique, the acoustic vibrations of plasmonic nanorods that were one nanometer amplitude or less and picosecond period upon femtosecond-pulsed photoexcitation were studied at the frictional interfaces. The subnanometer sensitivity in visualizing individual mechanical movement captures new details about acoustic vibrations such as the initial launching of the vibrations and the suppression and release of the vibration at the interfaces.},

          , 
            
              Temporally and spectrally resolved dynamics of optically excited carriers in graphene has been intensively studied theoretically and experimentally, whereas carrier diffusion in space has attracted much less attention. Understanding the spatio-temporal carrier dynamics is of key importance for optoelectronic applications, where carrier transport phenomena play an important role. In this work, we provide a microscopic access to the time-, momentum-, and space-resolved dynamics of carriers in graphene. We determine the diffusion coefficient to be

              and reveal the impact of carrier–phonon and carrier–carrier scattering on the diffusion process. In particular, we show that phonon-induced scattering across the Dirac cone gives rise to back-diffusion counteracting the spatial broadening of the carrier distribution.},

	abstract = {Optical properties of metal nanostructures are the basis of several scientific and technological applications. When the nanostructure characteristic size is of the order of few nm or less, it is generally accepted that only a description that explicitly describes electrons by quantum mechanics can reproduce faithfully its optical response. For example, the plasmon resonance shift upon shrinking the nanostructure size (red-shift for simple metals, blue-shift for d-metals such as gold and silver) is universally accepted to originate from the quantum nature of the system. Here we show instead that an atomistic approach based on classical physics, ωFQFμ (frequency dependent fluctuating charges and fluctuating dipoles), is able to reproduce all the typical “quantum” size effects, such as the sign and the magnitude of the plasmon shift, the progressive loss of the plasmon resonance for gold, the atomistically detailed features in the induced electron density, and the non local effects in the nanoparticle response. To support our findings, we compare the ωFQFμ results for Ag and Au with literature time-dependent DFT simulations, showing the capability of fully classical physics to reproduce these TDDFT results. Only electron tunneling between nanostructures emerges as a genuine quantum mechanical effect, that we had to include in the model by an ad hoc term.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Despite phase transitions, such as melting, being ubiquitous in nature, understanding what occurs at the nanoscale (such as in nanocrystals) has so far remained challenging. With ensemble studies of nanocrystals it is often difficult to discriminate between intrinsic size-dependent properties and effects due to sample size and shape dispersity. Here, using an X-ray free electron laser we image the reversible melting of an individual nanocrystal induced by an ultrashort laser. It is revealed that the melting occurs transiently, repeatably, and inhomogeneously. This is consistent with a core-shell model where the exterior is melted and a solid core remains. These findings reveal, unambiguously, that core-shell melting occurs, which has important implications for understanding nanoscale phenomena.
          , 
            There is a fundamental interest in studying photoinduced dynamics in nanoparticles and nanostructures as it provides insight into their mechanical and thermal properties out of equilibrium and during phase transitions. Nanoparticles can display significantly different properties from the bulk, which is due to the interplay between their size, morphology, crystallinity, defect concentration, and surface properties. Particularly interesting scenarios arise when nanoparticles undergo phase transitions, such as melting induced by an optical laser. Current theoretical evidence suggests that nanoparticles can undergo reversible nonhomogenous melting with the formation of a core-shell structure consisting of a liquid outer layer. To date, studies from ensembles of nanoparticles have tentatively suggested that such mechanisms are present. Here we demonstrate imaging transient melting and softening of the acoustic phonon modes of an individual gold nanocrystal, using an X-ray free electron laser. The results demonstrate that the transient melting is reversible and nonhomogenous, consistent with a core-shell model of melting. The results have implications for understanding transient processes in nanoparticles and determining their elastic properties as they undergo phase transitions.},

            We present the first real-time atomistic simulation on the quantum dynamics of icosahedral silver nanoparticles under strong laser pulses, using time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) molecular dynamics. We identify the emergence of sub-picosecond breathing-like radial oscillations starting immediately after laser pulse excitation, with increasing amplitude as the field intensity increases. The ultrafast dynamic response of nanoparticles to laser excitation points to a new mechanism other than equilibrium electron–phonon scattering previously assumed, which takes a much longer timescale. A sharp weakening of all bonds during laser excitation is observed, thanks to plasmon damping into excited electrons in anti-bonding states. This sudden weakening of bonds leads to a uniform expansion of the nanoparticles and launches coherent breathing oscillations.},

Larger monocrystalline particles show slower electron–phonon coupling due to the decreasing effect of electron-surface scattering, with electron–phonon coupling constants approaching the values reported for bulk gold. In polycrystalline particles, size dependencies are outweighed by effective electron scattering at grain boundaries. Linear absorption spectra indicate that plasmon damping is also enhanced in polycrystalline particles by grain boundaries.},

The commonly used experimental techniques are briefly reviewed. A variety of different phenomena can be described within a common theoretical framework based on the density-matrix formalism. The important interactions of the carriers included in the theoretical description are the phonon interactions, the interactions with classical and quantum light fields, and the Coulomb interaction among the carriers themselves. These interactions give rise to a strong interplay between phase coherence and relaxation, which strongly affects the nonequilibrium dynamics. Based on the general theory, the authors review the physical phenomena in various semiconductor structures including superlattices, quantum wells, quantum wires, and bulk media.

Here, instead of quenching, we show that quantum mechanical effects of plasmonic nanocavities can elevate surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) of molecular moieties. The plasmonic nanocavities, nanojunctions of gold and cadmium oxide nanoparticles, support prominent mid-infrared plasmonic resonances and enable SEIRA of an alkanethiol monolayer (CH3(CH2)n−1SH, n = 3–16). With a subnanometer cavity gap (n {\textless} 6), plasmonic resonances turn to blue shift and the SEIRA signal starts a pronounced increase, benefiting from the quantum tunneling effect across the plasmonic nanocavities. Our findings demonstrate the new possibility of optimizing the field enhancement and SEIRA sensitivity of mid-infrared plasmonic nanocavities.},

	abstract = {With recent experiments investigating the optical properties of progressively smaller plasmonic particles, quantum effects become increasingly more relevant, requiring a microscopic description. Using the density matrix formalism we analyze the photoexcited few-electron dynamics of a small plasmonic nanosphere. Following the standard derivation of the bulk plasmon we particularly aim at elucidating the role of the Coulomb interaction. Calculating the dielectric susceptibility spectrum in the linear optical response we find discrete resonances resulting from a collective response mediated by the Coulomb interaction between the electrons. In the nonlinear regime, the occupations of the system exhibit oscillations between the interacting eigenstates. Our approach provides an ideal platform to study and explain nonlinear and quantum plasmonics, revealing that the photoexcited dynamics of plasmonic nanospheres has similarities with and combines characteristics of both the well-known two-level Rabi dynamics and the collective many-electron behavior typical of plasmons.},

	doi = {10.1038/nnano.2014.311},
	abstract = {The discovery of the photoelectric effect by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 set the foundation for over 125 years of hot carrier science and technology. In the early 1900s it played a critical role in the development of quantum mechanics, but even today the unique properties of these energetic, hot carriers offer new and exciting opportunities for fundamental research and applications. Measurement of the kinetic energy and momentum of photoejected hot electrons can provide valuable information on the electronic structure of materials. The heat generated by hot carriers can be harvested to drive a wide range of physical and chemical processes. Their kinetic energy can be used to harvest solar energy or create sensitive photodetectors and spectrometers. Photoejected charges can also be used to electrically dope two-dimensional materials. Plasmon excitations in metallic nanostructures can be engineered to enhance and provide valuable control over the emission of hot carriers. This Review discusses recent advances in the understanding and application of plasmon-induced hot carrier generation and highlights some of the exciting new directions for the field.},

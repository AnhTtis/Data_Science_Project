    "abstract": "In a series of fundamental papers BK Ghosh reduced the simultaneous stabilization problem to a NevanlinnaPick interpolation problem. In this paper we generalize some of these results allowing for derivative constraints. Moreover, we apply a method based on a Riccati-type matrix equation, called the Covariance Extension Equation, which provides a parameterization of all solutions in terms of a monic Schur polynomial. The procedure is illustrated by examples.",

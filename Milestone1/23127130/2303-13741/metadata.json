    "abstract": "We investigate the influence of the temporal variations of various medium parameters on the propagation of Dirac-type waves in materials where the quasiparticles are described by a generalized version of the pseudospin-1/2 Dirac equation. Our considerations also include the propagation of electromagnetic waves in metamaterials with the Dirac-type dispersion. We focus on the variations of the scalar and vector potentials, mass, Fermi velocity, and tilt velocity describing the Dirac cone tilt. We derive the scattering coefficients associated with the temporal interfaces and slabs analytically and find that the temporal scattering is caused by the changes of the mass, Fermi velocity, and vector potential, but does not arise from the changes of the scalar potential and tilt velocity. We also explore the conditions under which the temporal Brewster effect and total reflection occur and calculate the change in total wave energy. We examine bilayer Dirac temporal crystals where parameters switch between two different sets of values periodically and prove that these systems do not have momentum gaps. Finally, we assess the potential for observing these temporal scattering effects in experiments.",

    "abstract": "According to the Markus conjecture, closed flat affine manifolds with parallel volume should be complete. We show it is the case for three-manifolds when the holonomy centralizes an affine transformation preserving the volume. It is notably the case when the holonomy group has non trivial center or when the automorphism group is non discrete.",

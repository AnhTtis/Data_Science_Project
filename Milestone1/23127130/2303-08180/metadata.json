    "abstract": "Transposed Poisson structures on the Schrödinger algebra in $(n+1)$-dimensional space-time of Schrödinger Lie groups are described. It was proven that the Schrödinger algebra $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$ in case of $n\\neq 2$ does not have non-trivial $\\frac{1}{2}$-derivations and as it follows it does not admit non-trivial transposed Poisson structures. All $\\frac{1}{2}$-derivations and transposed Poisson structures for the algebra $\\mathcal{S}_{2}$ are obtained. Also, we proved that the Schrödinger algebra $\\mathcal{S}_{2}$ admits a non-trivial ${\\rm Hom}$-Lie structure.",

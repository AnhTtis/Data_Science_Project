\section{True to the Model or True to the Data?}\label{app:truemodeltruedata}

%The \enquote{Equal Treatment Inspector} proposed in this work relies on the explanation distributions that satisfies efficiency and uninformative theoretical properties. 
%We have used the Shapley values as an explainable AI method that satisfies these properties. 
Many works discuss the application of Shapley values for feature attribution in ML models~\citep{DBLP:journals/kais/StrumbeljK14,DBLP:journals/natmi/LundbergECDPNKH20,DBLP:conf/nips/LundbergL17,lundberg2018explainable}. 
However, the correct way to connect a model to a coalitional game, which is the central concept of Shapley values, is a source of controversy, with two main approaches: an interventional \citep{DBLP:journals/ai/AasJL21,DBLP:conf/nips/FryeRF20,Zern2023Interventional}, and an observational formulation of the conditional expectation, see (\ref{def:val:obs},\ref{def:val:int}) \citep{DBLP:conf/icml/SundararajanN20,DBLP:conf/sp/DattaSZ16,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1911-00467}.

In the following experiment, we compare the impact of the two approaches on our \enquote{Equal Treatment Inspector}. We benchmark this experiment on the four prediction tasks based on the US census data~\citep{DBLP:conf/nips/DingHMS21} and use linear models for both the $f_\theta(X)$ and $g_\psi(\Ss(f_\theta,X))$.   We calculate the two variants of Shapley values using the SHAP linear explainer.\footnote{\url{https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/shap.explainers.Linear.html}}
%
The comparison will be parametric to a feature perturbation hyperparameter. The interventional SHAP values break the dependence structure between features in the model to uncover how the model would behave if the inputs are changed (as it was an intervention). 
This option is said to stay \enquote{true to the model} meaning it will only give allocation credit to the features that are actually used by the model.
%
On the other hand, the full conditional approximation of the SHAP values respects the correlations of the input features. If the model depends on one input that is correlated with another input, then both get some credit for the model’s behaviour. 
This option is said to say \enquote{true to the data}, meaning that it only considers how the model would behave when respecting the correlations in the input data~\citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2006-16234}.
%
We will measure the difference between the two approaches by looking at the AUC and at the linear coefficients of the inspector $g_\psi$, for this case only for the pair White-Other. In Table \ref{tab:t2mt2d.auc} and Table \ref{tab:t2mt2d.coefficients}, we can see that differences in AUC and coefficients are negligible.

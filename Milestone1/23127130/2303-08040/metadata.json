    "abstract": "Liberalism-oriented political philosophy reasons that all individuals should be treated equally independently of their protected characteristics. Related work in machine learning has translated the concept of equal treatment into terms of equal outcome and measured it as demographic parity (also called statistical parity). Our analysis reveals that the two concepts of equal outcome and equal treatment diverge; therefore, demographic parity does not faithfully represent the notion of equal treatment. We propose a new formalization for equal treatment by (i) considering the influence of feature values on predictions, such as computed by Shapley values explaining classifications, (ii) defining distributions of explanations, and (iii) comparing explanation distributions between populations with different protected characteristics. We show the theoretical properties of our notion of equal treatment and devise a classifier two-sample test based on the AUC of an equal treatment inspector. We study our formalization of equal treatment on synthetic and natural data. We release explanationspace, an open-source Python package with methods and tutorials.",

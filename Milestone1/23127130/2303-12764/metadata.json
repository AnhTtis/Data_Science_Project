    "abstract": "Let $p$ be a prime. This papers aims at investigating sheaf cohomology of a broader class of $p$-adic period domains, other then the Drinfeld's upper half space (cf. \\cite{O2}). Concretely, we let $\\mathbf{G}$ be a split connected reductive group over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ and restrict our attention to the $p$-adic period domain $\\mathscr{F}^{\\mathrm{wa}}$ which parametrizes the weakly admissible filtrations on the trivial $\\mathbf{G}$-isocrystal inside a complete flag variety $\\mathscr{F}$. Then, we consider sheaf cohomology of $\\mathscr{F}^{\\mathrm{wa}}$ with coefficients in vector bundles which are induced by restriction of a homogeneous line bundle on $\\mathscr{F}$ associated to a dominant weight of $\\mathbf{G}$.",

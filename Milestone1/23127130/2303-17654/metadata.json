    "abstract": "Astronomical images can be fascinating to the general public, but the interaction is typically limited to contemplation. Numerical simulations of astronomical systems do permit a closer interaction, but are generally unknown outside the research community. We are developing \"Protoplanet Express\", a video game based on hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary discs. In the game, the player visits several discs, finds its relevant features and learns about them. Here we present the current version of the game, discuss its reception, and consider its further development.",

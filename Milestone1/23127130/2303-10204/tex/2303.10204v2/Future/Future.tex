\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}
In this paper, we strive to emulate the ESP32 and understand how the medium access control (MAC) layer is handled within the emulation environment.  The evaluation is based on successfully passing network traffic between the host and emulated guest OSes in the form of HTTP request/response messages.  An important question to ask: how will this system behave at scale?

A logical next experiment is to evaluate the networking performance of the guest OS.  If we take the performance of the native ESP32 hardware as the gold standard, a comparison may be run to determine the potential latency of emulating the ESP32 instructions and the MAC layer.  A high rate of HTTP request messages would need to be sent to the target and the corresponding response delay measured.  In addition, with the containerizing of this emulation environment, an experiment may be performed to deploy numerous guest OS instances to evaluate how the response delay degrades as multiple emulated MAC instances communicate with the same host MAC.

The period of IDT fingers is as short as 1.6 μm so that the frequency of SAW is 3 GHz, which is comparable with that of magnetic resonance. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the SAW excitation intensity varied with the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field, owing to the dynamical coupling between SAWs and antiferromagnetic resonance of CuB2O4. The microscopic mechanism is discussed based on the symmetrically allowed magnetoelastic coupling.},

abstract = {Giant nonreciprocity in a SAW-based microwave isolator device is reported offering substantial size and performance advantages. Nonreciprocity, the defining characteristic of isolators, circulators, and a wealth of other applications in radio/microwave communications technologies, is generally difficult to achieve as most physical systems incorporate symmetries that prevent the effect. In particular, acoustic waves are an important medium for information transport, but they are inherently symmetric in time. In this work, we report giant nonreciprocity in the transmission of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on lithium niobate substrate coated with ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet (FeGaB/Al2O3/FeGaB) multilayer structure. We exploit this structure with a unique asymmetric band diagram and expand on magnetoelastic coupling theory to show how the magnetic bands couple with acoustic waves only in a single direction. We measure 48.4-dB (power ratio of 1:69,200) isolation that outperforms current state-of-the-art microwave isolator devices in a previously unidentified acoustic wave system that facilitates unprecedented size, weight, and power reduction. In addition, these results offer a promising platform to study nonreciprocal SAW devices.}

Our first-principles calculations, if only the effects of atomic vibrations are considered, predict a low-temperature NTE but lower by several orders of magnitude than experimental data. We propose magnetic excitations (magnons) as another important contributor to the NTE. We extend the theory of thermal expansion by including the contribution from magnons to Helmholtz free energy.

In the quasi two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of CrX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), Dirac magnons have been predicted at the crossing of acoustical and optical spin waves, analogous to Dirac fermions in graphene. Here we show that, distinct from CrBr3 and CrI3, gapless Dirac magnons are present in bulk CrCl3, with inelastic neutron scattering intensity at low temperatures approaching zero at the Dirac K point. Upon warming, magnon-magnon interactions induce strong renormalization and decreased lifetimes, with a ~25% softening of the upper magnon branch intensity from 5 to 50 K, though magnon features persist well above TN. Moreover, on cooling below ~50 K, an anomalous increase in the a-axis lattice constant and a hardening of a ~26 meV phonon feature are observed, indicating magnetoelastic and spin-phonon coupling arising from an increase in the in-plane spin correlations that begins tens of Kelvin above TN.},

In a second modeling approach, we deal with the backaction of the magnetization dynamics on the elastic wave by solving the elastic wave equation and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation self-consistently, obtaining analytical solutions for the acoustic wave phase shift and attenuation. We compare both modeling approaches with the complex forward transmission of a LiNbO 3/Ni surface acoustic wave hybrid device recorded experimentally as a function of the external magnetic field orientation and magnitude, rotating the field within three different planes and employing three different surface acoustic wave frequencies.

(The word "bound" implies that the excitation energy lies in the energy gap of the superconductor.) Such a localized pair excitation could occur in the absence of localized single-particle excitations, the position-dependent pairing potential Qs(R) being capable of binding the former but not the latter. " A second type of dynamic problem solvable with the present formalism is that of the inertia or eGective mass associated with a moving normal-sup erconducting interface. Just as in the analogous ferromagnetic problem of a moving domain @rail, " the kinetic energy of the interface results from the additional effective magnetic held required to cause ss(R) to precess as the interface passes through R. In addition to the egecfiee magnetic fields discussed thus far, the presence of a sea/ magnetic Geld in a superconductor can be included in the equations of motion by replacing Vz by Vn i (2e-/hc) A(R), A(R) being the magnetic vector potential at R. This procedure , completely analogous to that used by Ginzburg and Landau, " takes account of the eGect of the real magnetic Geld on the center-of-mass motion of the Cooper pairs, but does not properly describe magnetic effects on the internal motion of the Cooper pairs. Pote added iN proof By. returning to the methods of Ref. 3, it can be shown that V& should be replaced by vg-i(2e/hc)A(R) only in the terms of Kzx containing sis and sss, not in those containing sss. (For the latter terms, Vir should remain unchanged.) Furthermore , only the so-called transverse portion of A should be included in this replacement. Any longitudinal component of A, corresponding to center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs, should be introduced as an additional kinetic energy in Sic,s, having the form (1/4m) (2eAi/c)s Qs (st-sss). The temperature and magnetic-Geld dependences of the sublattice magnetization in the hexagonal layer-type compound CrC1& (Tran=16. 8'K) have been deduced from the "Cr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for 0.4& T&8. 1'K and 0&B&10 koe. The observed zero-Geld data can be accounted for over the whole temperature range by a renormaHzed spin-wave model based on isotropic ferromagnetic (Jr) intralayer and antiferromagnetic (Jz) interlayer exchange interactions in the presence of a weak effective anisotropy field (Hz). Appropriate renormalized spin-wave dispersion relations are given for the four-sublattice antiferro-magnetic (weak-field) and two-sublattice ferromagnetic (strong-field) equilibrium spin configurations. The validity of the two-dimensional approximation to these states is examined in detail for ksT &2 ~ Jz (szS and) Jr. ~ &&Jr. It is shown that under these conditions the sublattice magnetizations for Jz &0 and Jz &0 are identical. The three-dimensional zero-field spin-wave fit gives Jr/ks=5 25'K', Hz(0).=650 Oe and a O'K, zero-field "Cr frequency v(0) =63318Mc/sec.

The interlayer constant, Jz/ks =-0.018'K, used in the spin-wave calculations was obtained from single-crystal bulk magnetization measurements (xi =9.9 emu/mole for T &4'K), corrected for demagnetizing eifects. These measurements show that the net anisotropy in the ferromagnetic state (i.e., H& 1.68 kOe) is zero, presumably because of a cancellation of di-polar and single-ion contributions.

Weak van der Waals bonding between the layers and ferromagnetic in-plane magnetic order make it a promising material for obtaining atomically thin magnets and creating van der Waals heterostructures. In this work we have grown crystals of CrCl3, revisited the structural and thermodynamic properties of the bulk material, and explored mechanical exfoliation of the crystals. We find two distinct anomalies in the heat capacity at 14 and 17 K confirming that the magnetic order develops in two stages on cooling, with ferromagnetic correlations forming before long-range antiferromagnetic order develops between them. This scenario is supported by magnetization data. A magnetic phase diagram is constructed from the heat capacity and magnetization results. We also find an anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility at the crystallographic phase transition, indicating some coupling between the magnetism and the lattice. First-principles calculations accounting for van der Waals interactions also indicate spin-lattice coupling, and find multiple nearly degenerate crystallographic and magnetic structures consistent with the experimental observations. Finally, we demonstrate that monolayer and few-layer CrCl3 specimens can be produced from the bulk crystals by exfoliation, providing a path for the study of heterostructures and magnetism in ultrathin crystals down to the monolayer limit.},

Current pulses can initiate skyrmion creation in thin-film samples8–10 but require relatively large current densities, which probably causes Joule heating. Moreover, skyrmion creation is localized at a specific position in the film depending on the sample design. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an approach to skyrmion creation employing surface acoustic waves (SAWs); in asymmetric multilayers of Pt/Co/Ir, propagating SAWs induce skyrmions in a wide area of the magnetic film. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that inhomogeneous torque arising from both SAWs and thermal fluctuations creates magnetic textures, with pair structures consisting of a Néel skyrmion-like and an antiskyrmion-like structure. Subsequently, such pairs transform to a Néel skyrmion due to the instability of the antiskyrmion-like structure in a system with interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction. Our findings provide a tool for efficient manipulation of topological spin objects without heat dissipation and over large areas, given that the propagation length of SAWs is of the order of millimetres.},

We propose a different method to achieve a giant frequency band of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) nonreciprocity in an artificial structure, where a nonmagnetic acoustic crystal is magnetoelastically coupled to a synthetic antiferromagnet - a pair of thin ferromagnetic layers the static magnetizations of which are held opposite by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida interaction. Strongly nonreciprocal and approximately linear dispersion of SWs in this system makes it possible to match dispersions of SAWs and SWs in a wide frequency band for one direction of the wave propagation. Example calculations performed for the LiNbO3/Co/Ru/Co structure confirm the giant nonreciprocity of the SAW propagation in a frequency band exceeding 6 GHz.},

   abstract = {Spintronics relies on the transport of spins, the intrinsic angular momentum of electrons, as an alternative to the transport of electron charge as in conventional electronics. The long-term goal of spintronics research is to develop spin-based, low-dissipation computing-technology devices. Recently, long-distance transport of a spin current was demonstrated across ferromagnetic insulators1. However, antiferromagnetically ordered materials, the most common class of magnetic materials, have several crucial advantages over ferromagnetic systems for spintronics applications2: antiferromagnets have no net magnetic moment, making them stable and impervious to external fields, and can be operated at terahertz-scale frequencies3. Although the properties of antiferromagnets are desirable for spin transport4–7, indirect observations of such transport indicate that spin transmission through antiferromagnets is limited to only a few nanometres8–10. Here we demonstrate long-distance propagation of spin currents through a single crystal of the antiferromagnetic insulator haematite (α-Fe2O3)11, the most common antiferromagnetic iron oxide, by exploiting the spin Hall effect for spin injection. We control the flow of spin current across a haematite–platinum interface—at which spins accumulate, generating the spin current—by tuning the antiferromagnetic resonance frequency using an external magnetic field12. We find that this simple antiferromagnetic insulator conveys spin information parallel to the antiferromagnetic Néel order over distances of more than tens of micrometres. This mechanism transports spins as efficiently as the most promising complex ferromagnets1. Our results pave the way to electrically tunable, ultrafast, low-power, antiferromagnetic-insulator-based spin-logic devices6,13 that operate without magnetic fields at room temperature.},

Here we review the basic concepts of the so-called acoustic-FMR (a-FMR) induced by the coupling of surface acoustic waves (SAW) and magnetization of thin films. Interestingly, additional to the benefits of the microwave excited FMR technique, the coupling between SAW and magnetization also offers fertile ground to study magnon-phonon and spin rotation couplings.

Here spin-transport measurements in bilayer graphene evidence a strong spin–charge coupling due to a large induced exchange interaction by the proximity of an interlayer antiferromagnet (CrSBr). This results in the direct detection of the spin polarization of conductivity (up to 14%) and a spin-dependent Seebeck effect in the magnetic graphene. The efficient electrical and thermal spin–current generation is the most technologically relevant aspect of magnetism in graphene, controlled here by the antiferromagnetic dynamics of CrSBr. The high sensitivity of spin transport in graphene to the magnetization of the outermost layer of the adjacent antiferromagnet, furthermore, enables the read-out of a single magnetic sublattice. The combination of gate-tunable spin-dependent conductivity and Seebeck coefficient with long-distance spin transport in a single two-dimensional material promises ultrathin magnetic memory and sensory devices based on magnetic graphene.},

   abstract = {The physics and universality scaling of phase transitions in low-dimensional systems has historically been a topic of great interest. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibiting intriguing long-range magnetic order have been in the spotlight. Although an out-of-plane anisotropy has been shown to stabilize 2D magnetic order, the demonstration of a 2D magnet with in-plane rotational symmetry has remained elusive. We constructed a nearly ideal easy-plane system, a single CrCl 3 monolayer on graphene/6H-SiC(0001), and observed robust ferromagnetic ordering with critical scaling characteristic of a 2D-XY system. These observations indicate the realization of a finite-size Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in a large-area, quasi-free-standing van der Waals monolayer magnet with an XY universality class. This offers a material platform to host 2D superfluid spin transport and topological magnetic textures. H ow reduced dimensionality affects physical properties is a question that has fascinated researchers for decades. Recent technological advances have enabled the study of truly one-and two-dimensional systems. In this context, theoretical models of low-dimensional magnetism have been revisited. It was recognized early that the absence of long-range magnetic order in a low-dimensional system (d < 3) with continuous symmetry, postulated by Mermin and Wagner (1, 2), could be remedied by the existence of a sizable magnetic anisotropy. In 2D systems with easy-plane anisotropy, an unusual long-range order is expected to emerge as a result of the formation of magnetic vortex-antivortex or chirally opposing domain wall-bound pairs, theoretically described by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) formalism (3-5). This implies the occurrence of a phase transition even in a 2D magnetic system with continuous rotational symmetry O(2). This theory was later adapted to account for symmetry-breaking fields (6-8), finite size effects (9, 10), and spin-wave interactions with magnetic vortices (11). The work in (6), (7), (9), and (11) allowed the quantification of the order parameters and critical scaling near the phase transition for each scenario. A renormalization group approach was used to show that the magnetization of finite-sized 2D easy-plane systems-also called 2D-XY-scales with a critical exponent of b = 3p 2 /128 ≈ 0.231, defining a fingerprint of the XY universality class (9, 12). Perturbations to the rotational invariance of the spins in the plane-such as the symmetry and strength of magnetocrystalline fields-have been shown to strongly influence the critical exponents and the universality class. Whereas a uniaxial in-plane anisotropy (XYh 2) drives the system into an Ising-type behavior (b = 0.125), the effect of a four-fold symmetry (XYh 4) is highly dependent on the crystal field strength, with critical exponents ranging between Ising and XY universality classes (13). In contrast, the hexagonal symmetry (XYh 6) barely affects the magnetic behavior (4, 6, 7) even in the limit of strong crystal fields (13), such that the system remains in the XY class, thereby enabling the observation of a BKT-type phase transition. A large number of experiments on quasi-2D magnetic systems, such as monolayers on crystalline metallic surfaces or bulk layered magnets with small interplanar exchange interactions, have contributed to the assessment of the afore-mentioned theories [see (13, 14) for reviews]. However, in those cases, the substrate interaction through bonding and hybridization (mono-layers on surfaces) and the small amount of interplanar exchange (layered magnets) were conditions that precluded the realization of an ideal 2D system. Recent advances in the isolation and preparation of crystalline monolayers from innately layered magnets, via exfoliation (15-17) or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) (18), allow for more detailed investigations of low-dimensional critical phenomena. So far, ferro-magnetic ordering has been demonstrated in CrI 3 , CrBr 3 , and Fe 3 GeTe 2 monolayers (15, 16, 18), all of them stabilized by a substantial out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy that places them close to the Ising universality class, as discussed in recent reviews (19-22). A careful analysis of some of these systems, such as ferromagnetic CrBr 3 (23) or antiferromagnetic NiPS 3 (24), rather suggests XXZ-type magnetic behavior, the latter losing magnetic ordering in the monolayer regime. CrCl 3 , on the other hand, is an in-plane antiferromagnet in the bulk form (25, 26), resulting from an alternation between the magnetic moments in each individual CrCl 3 layer, which are ferromagnetically aligned in-plane. This leads to the question of whether a single-layer CrCl 3 would order ferromagnetically-or order magnetically at all-given its weak an-isotropy and the lack of interplanar exchange in the monolayer limit.},

   abstract = {A fundamental form of magnon-phonon interaction is an intrinsic property of magnetic materials, the "magneto-elastic coupling." This form of interaction has been the basis for describing magnetostrictive materials and their applications, where strain induces changes of internal magnetic fields. Different from the magnetoelastic coupling, more than 40 years ago, it was proposed that surface acoustic waves may induce surface magnons via rotational motion of the lattice in anisotropic magnets. However, a signature of this magnon-phonon coupling mechanism, termed magneto-rotation coupling, has been elusive. Here, we report the first observation and theoretical framework of the magneto-rotation coupling in a perpendicularly anisotropic film Ta/CoFeB(1.6 nanometers)/MgO, which consequently induces nonreciprocal acoustic wave attenuation with an unprecedented ratio of up to 100% rectification at a theoretically predicted optimized condition. Our work not only experimentally demonstrates a fundamentally new path for investigating magnon-phonon coupling but also justifies the feasibility of the magneto-rotation coupling application.},

The resulting zero net magnetic moment makes magnetism in antiferromagnets externally invisible. This implies that information stored in antiferromagnetic moments would be invisible to common magnetic probes, insensitive to disturbing magnetic fields, and the antiferromagnetic element would not magnetically affect its neighbours, regardless of how densely the elements are arranged in the device. The intrinsic high frequencies of antiferromagnetic dynamics represent another property that makes antiferromagnets distinct from ferromagnets. Among the outstanding questions is how to manipulate and detect the magnetic state of an antiferromagnet efficiently. In this Review we focus on recent works that have addressed this question. The field of antiferromagnetic spintronics can also be viewed from the general perspectives of spin transport, magnetic textures and dynamics, and materials research. We briefly mention this broader context, together with an outlook of future research and applications of antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

   abstract = {The synthesis of single-cycle pulses of compressed light and microwave signals sparked novel areas of fundamental research. In the field of acoustics, however, such a generation has not been introduced yet. For numerous applications, the large spatial extent of surface acoustic waves (SAW) causes unwanted perturbations and limits the accuracy of physical manipulations. Particularly, this restriction applies to SAW-driven quantum experiments with single flying electrons, where extra modulation renders the exact position of the transported electron ambiguous and leads to undesired spin mixing. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating single-shot chirp synthesis of a strongly compressed acoustic pulse. Employing this solitary SAW pulse to transport a single electron between distant quantum dots with an efficiency exceeding 99%, we show that chirp synthesis is competitive with regular transduction approaches. Performing a time-resolved investigation of the SAW-driven sending process, we outline the potential of the chirped SAW pulse to synchronize single-electron transport from many quantum-dot sources. By superimposing multiple pulses, we further point out the capability of chirp synthesis to generate arbitrary acoustic waveforms tailorable to a variety of (opto)nanomechanical applications. Our results shift the paradigm of compressed pulses to the field of acoustic phonons and pave the way for a SAW-driven platform of single-electron transport that is precise, synchronized, and scalable.},

   abstract = {Excitons are elementary optical excitation in semiconductors. The ability to manipulate and transport these quasiparticles would enable excitonic circuits and devices for quantum photonic technologies. Recently, interlayer excitons in 2D semiconductors have emerged as a promising candidate for engineering excitonic devices due to their long lifetime, large exciton binding energy, and gate tunability. However, the charge-neutral nature of the excitons leads to weak response to the in-plane electric field and thus inhibits transport beyond the diffusion length. Here, we demonstrate the directional transport of interlayer excitons in bilayer WSe2 driven by the propagating potential traps induced by surface acoustic waves (SAW). We show that at 100 K, the SAW-driven excitonic transport is activated above a threshold acoustic power and reaches 20 μm, a distance at least ten times longer than the diffusion length and only limited by the device size. Temperature-dependent measurement reveals the transition from the diffusion-limited regime at low temperature to the acoustic field-driven regime at elevated temperature. Our work shows that acoustic waves are an effective, contact-free means to control exciton dynamics and transport, promising for realizing 2D materials-based excitonic devices such as exciton transistors, switches, and transducers up to room temperature.},

    "abstract": "We consider the inverse problem to determine a smooth compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ from a restriction of the source-to-solution operator, $Λ_{\\mathcal{S,R}}$, for the wave equation on the manifold. Here, $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$ are open sets on $M$, and $Λ_{\\mathcal{S,R}}$ represents the measurements of waves produced by smooth sources supported on $\\mathcal{S}$ and observed on $\\mathcal{R}$. We emphasise that $\\overline{\\mathcal{S}}$ and $\\overline{\\mathcal{R}}$ could be disjoint. We demonstrate that $Λ_{\\mathcal{S,R}}$ determines the manifold $(M,g)$ uniquely under the following spectral bound condition for the set $\\mathcal{S}$: There exists a constant $C>0$ such that any normalized eigenfunction $φ_k$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $(M,g)$ satisfies\n  \\begin{equation*}\n  1\\leq C\\|φ_k\\|_{L^2(\\mathcal{S})}.\n  \\end{equation*}\n  We note that, for the Anosov surface, this spectral bound condition is fulfilled for any non-empty open subset $\\mathcal{S}$. Our approach is based on the paper [18] and the spectral bound condition above is an analogue of the Hassell-Tao condition there.",

    "abstract": "We study the asymptotics for the Ablowitz-Ladik equation. By taking appropriate continuum limits, it can be shown that the behavior of the equation near degenerate frequencies is well approximated by a complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. Using this connection, we use the method of space-time resonances to derive a description of the modified scattering behavior of the Ablowitz-Ladik equation, which includes two regions where the solution behaves like a self-similar solution to the complex mKdV equation.",

    "abstract": "Proposing and implementing software systems, especially web applications for e-commerce using the traditional monolithic approach has been the norm, however, as new user requirements force organisations and developers to add more functionalities to their systems, and as user demands increases, the performance of monolith applications decreases, and maintenance costs rise. These issues have necessitated a need for a better system and that is where Microservices event-driven applications come in. This thesis investigates the scopeand impact of migrating to Microservices, using agile frameworks, and bi-modal ITstrategy. To obtain quantitative data for analysis, prototypes of monolith and microservice websites were integrated with Dropwizard, an open source metrics, and Apache JMeter, and response time and error rate readings were collected. Results showed that monoliths have a faster response time when the number of user request calls is within tolerant range, better than Microservices, but as complexity grows over time and there is increased user requestcalls, Microservices appears to perform better.",

    "abstract": "States of low energy in cosmology minimise the energy density when smeared in a chosen time interval. We extend their construction to generic homogeneous (possibly anisotropic) particle creation settings. Focusing on the Schwinger effect, we study the role played by the support of the smearing function and identify the vacua obtained in the limiting cases of small and large time intervals. We also analyse the spectral properties of the power spectrum and the number of created particles, which are complementary in characterising the vacuum, and investigate the multipolar contributions coming from the anisotropies.",

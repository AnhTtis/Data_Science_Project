    "abstract": "The paper concerns problems of the recovery of operators from noisy information in weighted $L_q$-spaces with homogeneous weights. A number of general theorems are proved and applied to finding exact constants in multidimensional Carlson type inequalities with several weights and problems of the recovery of differential operators from a noisy Fourier transform. In particular, optimal methods are obtained for the recovery of powers of generalized Laplace operators from a noisy Fourier transform in the $L_p$-metric.",

    "abstract": "A new end-plugging method for rotating plasmas is identified and analyzed. It uses the ponderomotive potential associated with an azimuthal magnetostatic wiggler. Studied both analytically and numerically, this process compares favorably to other end-plugging methods in open field line magnetized plasma devices.",

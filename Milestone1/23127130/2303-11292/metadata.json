    "abstract": "We study the logical properties of infinite geometric random graphs, introduced by Bonato and Janssen. These are graphs whose vertex set is a dense ``generic'' subset of a metric space, where two vertices are adjacent with probability $p>0$ provided the distance between them is bounded by some constant number. We prove that for a large class of metric spaces, including circles, spheres and the complete Urysohn space, almost all geometric random graphs on a given space are elementary equivalent. Moreover, their first-order theory can reveal geometric properties of the underlying metric space.",

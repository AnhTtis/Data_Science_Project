    % \todo{ format this; better caption + labels}. 
    In this plot, we analyse the various types of failure modes that occur with the integrated planner and the hierarchical planner when evaluated on tasks with partial affordance perception (PAP; see Sec.~\ref{subsec:task-suite} for an explanation) and tasks without partial affordance perception (non-PAP). \textbf{Top}: For the PAP tasks, the hierarchical planner outperforms the integrated planner. We attribute this difference to the hierarchical planner's ability to output multiple task plans while the integrated planner can only output a single plan. \textbf{Bottom}: For the non-PAP tasks, the hierarchical planner is much less likely to output a plan than the integrated approach as the integrated approach is able to use its value functions to prune away geometrically infeasible action sequences.}

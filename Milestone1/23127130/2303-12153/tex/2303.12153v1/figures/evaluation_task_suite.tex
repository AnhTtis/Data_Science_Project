    \caption{\textbf{TableEnv Manipulation evaluation task suite}. We evaluate the performance of all methods on a task suite based on the above manipulation domain. The tasks considered vary in terms of difficult and each contains a subset of three properties: being long-horizon (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6), containing lifted goals (Tasks 4, 5, 6), and having partial affordance perception (Tasks 4, 5, 6). During evaluation, we randomize the geometric parameters of each task for each random seed.}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present a language-based planner that combines LLMs, learned skills policies, and policy sequence optimization to solve robot manipulation tasks containing geometric dependencies.
Text2Motion constructs a task- and policy-level plan and verifies that it satisfies a natural language instruction by testing the planned states against inferred goal propositions.
In contrast to prior language planners, Text2Motion certifies that its plan satisfies the goal before executing any actions in the environment.
Text2Motion tightly integrates task- and policy-level planning by using value function heuristics to guide LLM task planning during search, whilst actively optimizing the running sequence of skills to resolve long-horizon action dependencies.
Our results highlight the importance of policy sequence optimization when solving TAMP-like tasks from a natural language instruction, that integrated planning is equipped to solve a family of semantically partially observable problems, and that plan termination via inferred symbolic constraints is more reliable than prior LLM scoring techniques.

% satisfying natural language instructions on TAMP-like tasks with LLMs and robot skills, that integrated planning is better suited to a class of partially observable problems, and that plan termination via inferred symbolic constraints is more reliable than prior LLM scoring techniques.
% We outline the limitations of Text2Motion and highlight promising avenues for future work.

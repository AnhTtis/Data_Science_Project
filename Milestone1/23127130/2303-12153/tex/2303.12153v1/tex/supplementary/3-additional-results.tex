% \section{Extended Results}
% \label{sec:results-details}

% We provide the expanded results of (1) the failure modes of Text2Motion and \hm{} (Fig.~\ref{}) and (2) the ablation on plan termination techniques applied to Text2Motion (Fig.~\ref{}) comparing \texttt{stop} scoring versus goal proposition prediction.
% The results are consistent with the aggregate metrics reported in the main draft.

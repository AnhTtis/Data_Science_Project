    "abstract": "Afterpulsing is a factor limiting the distance over which discrete-variable quantum key distribution systems are secure, and a common feature in single-photon detectors. The relevance of this phenomenon stems from its stochastic, self-interacting nature and the fact that its rate rises with the number of avalanche events, which increases the quantum bit error rate. Here we introduce an effective analytic model, including dead-time and afterpulsing corrections, where afterpulsing correction depends on dead-time value. This model is useful to evaluate the performance of prepare and measure quantum key distribution protocols (standard and decoy versions) that use gated single photon detectors. The model provides an expression to numerically optimize the secret key rate over the full distance range for secure communication, enabling in this way the calculation of quantum bit error rate and secure key rate. In the conventional procedure, the dead-time value is fixed regardless of distance, limiting the distance range of the channel due to remaining afterpulsing effects, which are more relevant at higher operating frequencies. Here we demonstrate that optimizing the dead-time values increases the distance range of the channel to share secret keys.",

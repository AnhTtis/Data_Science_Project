abstract = {Abstract The passive decoy method, a candidate for high-speed quantum key distribution (QKD), can prepare laser pulses with various photon-number distributions according to the responses of the transmitter's detectors, which usually adopts the single-photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) in QKD. As an intrinsic characteristic of the SPAD, the afterpulse can introduce random detector responses, however, is regrettably ignored in passive schemes. Here we develop an analytical model for passive schemes in the finite-resource regime to describe the afterpulse effect on the detectors of both transmitter and receiver. The photon-number distributions biased by afterpulses are corrected, which reveals that the secure key rate is significantly overrated when the afterpulse is ignored. Moreover, our model can increase the tolerance of passive decoy source to afterpulse effect as the result shows that the secret key rates are comparable at different afterpulse probability by reoptimization.},

By employing the photon number resolving capability of the photodiodes the response to higher order photon coincidences can be measured. As an example we show experimentally the sensitivity to higher order correlations for three types of photon sources with distinct photon statistics. This higher order correlation technique could be used as a low cost and compact tool for quantifying the degree of correlation of photon sources employed in quantum information science.},

We show that a high degree of goodness of fit can be obtained for 5 exponentials, but the physical meaning of estimated characteristic times is dubious. We show that a continuous limit of the sum of exponentials with a uniform density between the limiting times gives excellent fitting results in the full range of the detector response function. This means that in certain detectors the afterpulsing is caused by a continuous band of deep levels in the active area of the photodetector.},

To improve security of the practical quantum key distribution system, we propose the weak measurement model to monitor the intercept-resend eavesdropping strategy in the quantum channel, where the detector-blinding attack and the wavelength attack can be observed through the quantum bit error rate value in the weak measurement model.},

single-photon detectors with the same area but with some limitations: (1) Reducing the series
inductance of SNAPs (necessary for the avalanche formation) could result in the detectors operating
in an unstable regime, (2) a trade-off exists between maximizing the bias current margin and
minimizing the reset time of SNAPs, and (3) reducing the reset time of SNAPs below 1 ns resulted
in afterpulsing.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a characterization method for the overall detection efficiency, afterpulse and dark count probabilities of single-photon counting modules in real-time with simple instrumentation. This method can be applied when the
module is running in its intended application, and is based on monitoring the statistics of the times between consecutive detections. A mathematical model is derived and fit to the data statistical distribution to simultaneously extract the characterization parameters. The feasibility of our scheme is demonstrated by performing measurements on three commercial devices based on cooled InGaAs avalanche photodiodes operating in gated mode. Different statistical ensemble lengths were analyzed and results assess the scheme for real-time application.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Quantum key distribution is a practically implementable cryptographic communication methodology from the hardware and software point of view. It is an information-theoretic secure method for transmitting keys to remote partners practicing quantum communication. After examining various protocols from the most basic on, BBM92, DPSK, SARG04 and MDI (Measurement Device Independent) protocols are described in view of targeting the longest possible communication distance with the highest secret key bitrate. How any protocol can be optimized with respect to distance is discussed by analyzing the various steps impacting hardware and software that are developed, starting from the underlying assumptions proper to every protocol and ending with the corresponding performance in each case.},

  Abstract                 = {Operating principles of Solid State Photomultipliers are based on Geiger mode avalanche breakdown limited by strong negative feedback. This operating mode provides both high gain and ultra-low excess noise of avalanche multiplication resulting in ability to detect single photons. On the other hand high gain is accompanied with cross-talk and afterpulsing processes changing the probability distribution function of output signals and arising specific excess noise. There are many reports regarding its influence on signal distribution and noise, and we suggest that some analytical expressions would be useful.
We therefore are presenting a simple model of probability distribution of output signals in the presence of cross-talk and afterpulsing (namely compound Poisson distribution). The model results allow us to calculate excess noise factor of cross-talk and afterpulsing as well as to find simple way to measure its probabilities.},

The afterpulsing probability is obtained through measuring the detection efficiencies of various biasing pulses, while the incident photons are kept constant. The effect of excess bias and temperature on the afterpulsing probability is investigated. When the device temperature is higher than 170 K, the afterpulsing probability is lower than 5% for all excess bias voltages because the trapped carrier lifetime is much shorter than the repetition period.},

This effect is particularly troubling in photon correlation experiments. Few treatments of this effect have appeared in the literature, and few software programs to solve the problem have been written. We demonstrate the afterpulsing effect in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy by using different avalanche photodiodes. We prove theoretically that under simple and reasonable conditions afterpulsing in autocorrelation can be eliminated to the leading order; we have found it easy to program software for the correction. We compare our results with those from cross correlation. We also discuss some experimental parameters that may affect the afterpulsing.},

We propose a useful way to characterize the afterpulsing distribution for rapid gating that allows for easy comparison with conventional gating regimes. We compare the performance of this rapid gating scheme with free-running detector and superconducting single-photon detector (SSPD) for the coherent one-way quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocol. The rapid gating system is well suited for both high-rate and long-distance QKD applications, in which Mbps key rates can be achieved for distances less than 40km with 50 ns deadtime and the maximum distance is limited to $\aprox$ 190km with 5 $\mu$s deadtime. These results illustrate that the afterpulsing is no longer a limiting factor for QKD.},

A violation of this inequality normally also certifies security of device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD) so that an attacker cannot eavesdrop or control the system. We show how this security test can be circumvented in energy-time entangled systems when using standard avalanche photodetectors, allowing an attacker to compromise the system without leaving a trace. We reach Bell values up to 3.63 at 97.6\% faked detector efficiency using tailored pulses of classical light, which exceeds even the quantum prediction. This is the first demonstration of a violation-faking source that gives both tunable violation and high faked detector efficiency. The implications are severe: the standard Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality cannot be used to show device-independent security for energy-time entanglement setups based on Franson{\textquoteright}s configuration. However, device-independent security can be reestablished, and we conclude by listing a number of improved tests and experimental setups that would protect against all current and future attacks of this type.},

	journal = {New Journal of Physics},
	abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) can, in principle, provide unconditional security based on the fundamental laws of physics. Unfortunately, a practical QKD system may contain overlooked imperfections and may thus violate some of the assumptions in the security proofs of QKD. It is important to explore these assumptions. One key assumption is that the sender (Alice) can prepare the required quantum states without errors. However, such an assumption may be violated in a practical QKD system. In this paper, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate a technically feasible 'intercept- and-resend' attack that exploits such a security loophole in a commercial 'plug & play' QKD system. The resulting quantum bit error rate is 19.7%, which is substantially lower than the well-known 25% error rate for an intercept-and-resend attack in BB84. The attack we utilize is the phase-remapping attack (Fung et al 2007 Phys. Rev. A 75 32314) proposed by our group.}

We employ bright pulses as faked states, timed to arrive at the avalanche photodiodes outside the activation time. The attack can remain unnoticed, since the faked states do not increase the error rate per se. This allows for an intercept?resend attack, where an eavesdropper transfers her detection events to the legitimate receiver without causing any errors. As a side effect, afterpulses, originating from accumulated charge carriers in the detectors, increase the error rate. We have experimentally tested detectors of the system id3110 (Clavis2) from ID Quantique. We identify the parameter regime in which the attack is feasible despite the side effect. Furthermore, we outline how simple modifications in the implementation can make the device immune to this attack.}

We found that bright light can temporarily make a large fraction of the nanowire length normally conductive, can extend deadtime after a normal photon detection, and can cause a hotspot formation during the deadtime with a highly nonlinear sensitivity. As a result, although based on different physics, the superconducting detector turns out to be controllable by virtually the same techniques as avalanche photodiode detectors. As demonstrated earlier, when such detectors are used in a quantum key distribution system, this allows an eavesdropper to launch a detector control attack to capture the full secret key without this being revealed by too many errors in the key.}

Actively-quenched detectors are commonly used for quantum key distribution (QKD) in the visible and near-infrared range. This study shows that these detectors are controllable by the same attack used to hack passively-quenched and gated detectors. This demonstrates the generality of our attack and its possible applicability to eavsdropping the full secret key of all QKD systems using avalanche photodiodes (APDs). Moreover, the commercial detector model we tested (PerkinElmer SPCM-AQR) exhibits two new blinding mechanisms in addition to the previously observed thermal blinding of the APD, namely: malfunctioning of the bias voltage control circuit, and overload of the DC/DC converter biasing the APD. These two new technical loopholes found just in one detector model suggest that this problem must be solved in general, by incorporating generally imperfect detectors into the security proof for QKD.},

Photonics 4, 686 (2010)\]. This allows for an attack eavesdropping the full raw and secret key without increasing the quantum bit error rate (QBER). Here we show how thermal effects in detectors under bright illumination can lead to the same outcome. We demonstrate that the detectors in a commercial QKD system Clavis2 can be blinded by heating the avalanche photo diodes (APDs) using bright illumination, so-called thermal blinding. Further, the detectors can be triggered using short bright pulses once they are blind. For systems with pauses between packet transmission such as the plug-and-play systems, thermal inertia enables Eve to apply the bright blinding illumination before eavesdropping, making her more difficult to catch.},

abstract = {We present a detailed description of a widely applicable mathematical model for quantum key distribution (QKD) systems implementing the measurement-device-independent (MDI) protocol. The model is tested by comparing its predictions with data taken using a proof-of-principle, time-bin qubit-based QKD system in a secure laboratory environment (i.e. in a setting in which eavesdropping can be excluded). The good agreement between the predictions and the experimental data allows the model to be used to optimize mean photon numbers per attenuated laser pulse, which are used to encode quantum bits. This in turn allows optimization of secret key rates of existing MDI-QKD systems, identification of rate-limiting components, and projection of future performance. In addition, we also performed measurements over deployed fiber, showing that our system's performance is not affected by environment-induced perturbations.},

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we proposed a purely functional Lisp based on fexprs, \kraken, and the first-ever compilation framework to make fexprs performant by utilizing partial evaluation.
The partial evaluator will evaluate away all fexprs that behave like macros (namely operatives of a particular form), showing that our marcro-esque fexprs can be as efficient as compile-time macros with a minor penalty to dynamic function calls.
In addition, the partial evaluator with the compiler optimizations produced better-optimized code than the base interpreter (70,000x faster) or NewLisp's fexpr implementation~\cite{mueller2018newlisp} (233x faster).
We have shown that fexprs can be a reasonably performant alternative to macros and are a viable foundation for new expressive functional languages in the Lisp tradition.

In the future we will look at improving the partial evaluator to handle more flexible definitions of operatives that are less strictly macro-like, as well as investigation into adding features such has delimited continuations, which we had removed from Shutt's Vau calculi for simplicity.

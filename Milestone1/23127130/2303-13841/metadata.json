    "abstract": "Recent studies on nucleon and alpha knockout reactions have shown that the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) is a simple and accurate method to describe these reactions. As it has been argued for decades, the nuclear absorption is one of the most important ingredients of the DWIA calculation. In this work, we systematically investigate the absorption effects on the cross sections of the nucleon and alpha knockout reactions. To do this, we calculate the ratio of the cross sections of the DWIA and plane-wave impulse approximation (PWIA) and examine its dependence on the atomic number and single-particle orbital of the knocked-out particles. We will discuss the specific characteristics of the absorption effect for each reaction.",

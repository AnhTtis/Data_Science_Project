\begin{abstract}
Measurements of the production of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = {13~\rm TeV}$ at midrapidity with the ALICE detector are presented down to a transverse momentum (\pt) of 0.2 GeV$/c$ and up to $p_{\rm T} = 35~{\rm GeV/}c$, which is the largest momentum range probed for inclusive electron measurements in ALICE.
In \pPb collisions, the production cross section and the nuclear modification factor of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays are measured in the \pt range 0.5 $< p_{\rm T} <$ 26 GeV$/c$ at $\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}=8.16~{\rm TeV}$. The nuclear modification factor is found to be consistent with unity within the statistical and systematic uncertainties. 
In both collision systems, first measurements of the yields of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in different multiplicity intervals normalised to the multiplicity-integrated  yield (self-normalised yield) at midrapidity are reported as a function of the self-normalised charged-particle multiplicity estimated at midrapidity.
The self-normalised yields in pp and \pPb collisions grow faster than linear with the self-normalised multiplicity. A strong \pt~dependence is observed in pp collisions, where the yield of high-\pt electrons increases faster as a function of multiplicity than the one of low-\pt electrons. The measurement in \pPb collisions shows no \pt~dependence within uncertainties.
The self-normalised yields in pp and \pPb collisions are compared with measurements of other heavy-flavour, light-flavour, and strange particles, and with Monte Carlo simulations. 


{\it Keywords:} Heavy-flavour electrons, nuclear modification factor, self-normalised yield, multiplicity, pp collisions, \pPb collisions

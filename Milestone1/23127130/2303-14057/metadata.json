    "abstract": "The reciprocal of $e^{-x}$ has a power series about $0$ in which all coefficients are non-negative. Gessel [Reciprocals of exponential polynomials and permutation enumeration, Australas. J. Combin., 74, 2019] considered truncates of the power series of $e^{-x}$, i.e. polynomials of the form $\\sum_{n=0}^r (-1)^n\\frac{x^n}{n!}$, and established combinatorially that the reciprocal of the truncate has a power series with all coefficients non-negative precisely when $r$ is odd.\n  Here we extend Gessel's observations to arbitrary ``thinned exponential series''.\n  To be precise, let $A \\subseteq \\{1,3,5,\\ldots\\}$ and $B \\subseteq \\{2,4,6,\\ldots\\}$, and consider the series\n  \\[\n  1-\\sum_{a \\in A} \\frac{x^a}{a!} + \\sum_{b \\in B} \\frac{x^b}{b!}.\n  \\]\n  We consider conditions on $A$ and $B$ that ensure that the reciprocal series has all coefficients non-negative. We give combinatorial proofs for a large set of conditions, including whenever $1 \\in A$ and the endpoints of the maximal consecutive intervals in $A \\cup B$ are odd integers.\n  In particular, the coefficients in the reciprocal series can be interpreted as ordered set partitions of $[n]$ with block size restrictions, or in terms of permutations with restricted lengths of maximally increasing runs, suitably weighted.",

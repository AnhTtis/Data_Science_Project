\section{Real-World Validation}
All grasps in Fig.~\ref{fig:minmax} are tested in the real-world by loading a custom Franka-shaped clamp with fixed weights.

\caption{Grasps from Fig.~\ref{fig:minmax} validated with a custom Franka-shaped clamp loaded with $15N$. For the bottle and lemon, deformation is measured by proxy using change ($\Delta$) in volume and weight. For the strawberry, the only high-stress grasp imparts significant permanent damage.}

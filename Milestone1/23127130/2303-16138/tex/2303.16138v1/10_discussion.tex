\section{Discussion and Future Work}
We present DefGraspNets, a differentiable GNN-based model for FEM simulation of 3D stress and deformation fields. We demonstrate that training DefGraspNets on a diverse set of grasps on primitive geometries enables effective prediction and grasp planning on unseen, real-world geometries. DefGraspNets enables not only fast evaluation of sampled candidate grasps ($1500$x faster than GPU-accelerated FEM), but also gradient-based refinement of these grasps to optimize field quantities (e.g., max stress and mean deformation). We verify the effectiveness of optimized grasps on novel objects both in the ground-truth FEM simulator and in the real world. 

To expand DefGraspNets for use in downstream manipulation tasks such as food preparation or robotic surgery, prediction of additional quantities should be explored. These may include stability during transport and deformation and flow under reorientation and gravity. 
%or fluid dynamics as it exits the bottle. 
Furthermore, as FEM simulators evolve, DefGraspNets can be retrained to predict  soft-soft contact or heterogeneous material responses. 

Developing data augmentation techniques for \textit{meshes} may enable vast dataset scaling from a minimal set of object models, further strengthening our ability to generalize to unseen objects. 
%As our results suggest, generating train objects that are geometrically relevant to test objects is extremely useful. 
In addition, as our network is differentiable, techniques such as Stein variational gradient descent \cite{NIPS2016_b3ba8f1b} and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics \cite{Welling2011Lan} may allow us to provide probabilistic, multi-modal \textit{distributions} of optimal grasps. Finally, architecture optimization (e.g., sparsity acceleration \cite{Choy2019CVPR}) may lead to even faster performance. 

DefGraspNets contributes the first differentiable approach to deformable grasp planning capable of predicting and optimizing stress and deformation fields on novel objects. We believe this coupling of fast prediction of field quantities with a differentiable model will enable a wide range of users to apply deformable grasp planning to their target domains.

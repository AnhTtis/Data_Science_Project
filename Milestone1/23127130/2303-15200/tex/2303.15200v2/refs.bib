abstract = {Two efficient algorithms for enclosing a zero of a continuous function are presented. They are similar to the recent methods, but together with quadratic interpolation they make essential use of inverse cubic interpolation as well. Since asymptotically the inverse cubic interpolation is always chosen by the algorithms, they achieve higher-efficiency indices: 1.6529… for the first algorithm, and 1.6686… for the second one. It is proved that the second algorithm is optimal in a certain family. Numerical experiments show that the two new methods compare well with recent methods, as well as with the efficient solvers of Dekker, Brent, Bus and Dekker, and Le. The second method from the present article has the best behavior of all 12 methods especially when the termination tolerance is small.},

@article{Sanchis-Ojeda_2014,
	abstract = {We present the results of a survey aimed at discovering and studying transiting planets with orbital periods shorter than one day (ultra-short-period, or USP, planets), using data from the Kepler spacecraft. We computed Fourier transforms of the photometric time series for all 200,000 target stars, and detected transit signals based on the presence of regularly spaced sharp peaks in the Fourier spectrum. We present a list of 106 USP candidates, of which 18 have not previously been described in the literature. This list of candidates increases the number of planet candidates with orbital periods shorter than about six hours from two to seven. In addition, among the objects we studied, there are 26 USP candidates that had been previously reported in the literature which do not pass our various tests. All 106 of our candidates have passed several standard tests to rule out false positives due to eclipsing stellar systems. A low false positive rate is also implied by the relatively high fraction of candidates for which more than one transiting planet signal was detected. By assuming these multi-transit candidates represent coplanar multi-planet systems, we are able to infer that the USP planets are typically accompanied by other planets with periods in the range 1--50 days, in contrast with hot Jupiters which very rarely have companions in that same period range. Another clear pattern is that almost all USP planets are smaller than 2 R⊕, possibly because gas giants in very tight orbits would lose their atmospheres by photoevaporation when subject to extremely strong stellar irradiation. Based on our survey statistics, USP planets exist around approximately (0.51 $\pm$ 0.07)% of G-dwarf stars, and (0.83 $\pm$ 0.18)% of K-dwarf stars.},

abstract = {We present astrophysical false positive probability calculations for every Kepler Object of Interest (KOI)—the first large-scale demonstration of a fully automated transiting planet validation procedure. Out of 7056 KOIs, we determine that 1935 have probabilities &lt;1% of being astrophysical false positives, and thus may be considered validated planets. Of these, 1284 have not yet been validated or confirmed by other methods. In addition, we identify 428 KOIs that are likely to be false positives, but have not yet been identified as such, though some of these may be a result of unidentified transit timing variations. A side product of these calculations is full stellar property posterior samplings for every host star, modeled as single, binary, and triple systems. These calculations use vespa, a publicly available Python package that is able to be easily applied to any transiting exoplanet candidate.}

	abstract = {In addition to long-lived radioactive nuclei like U and Th isotopes, which have been used to measure the age of theGalaxy, also radioactive nuclei with half-lives between 0.1 and 100 million years (short-lived radionuclides, SLRs) were present in the early Solar System (ESS), as indicated by high-precision meteoritic analysis. We review the most recent meteoritic data and describe the nuclear interaction processes responsible for the creation of SLRs in different types of stars and supernovae. We show how the evolution of radionuclide abundances in the Milky Way Galaxy can be calculated based on their stellar production. By comparing predictions for the evolution of galactic abundances to the meteoritic data we can build up a time line for the nucleosynthetic events that predated the birth of the Sun, and investigate the lifetime of the stellar nursery where the Sun was born. We then review the scenarios for the circumstances and the environment of the birth of the Sun, within such a stellar nursery, that have been invoked to explain the abundances in the ESS of the SLRs with the shortest lives --- of the order of million years or less. Finally, we describe how the heat generated by radioactive decay and in particular by the abundant 26Al in the ESS had important consequences for the thermo-mechanical and chemical evolution of planetesimals, and discuss possible implications on the habitability of terrestrial-like planets. We conclude with a set of open questions and future directions related to our understanding of the nucleosynthetic processes responsible for the production of SLRs in stars, their evolution in the Galaxy, the birth of the Sun, and the connection with the habitability of extra-solar planets.},

@article{Reese+Solomatov06,
	abstract = {The evolution of a melt region produced by a large impact during Mars formation is addressed. While some impact induced melt is redistributed during crater excavation, sufficiently large impacts (much larger than basin forming impacts) generate an intact melt region which is retained beneath the excavation zone, i.e., a local magma ocean. Local magma ocean evolution depends on the effective rheology controlling large scale deformation of the solid part of the planet, mechanism of crystallization, and melt region size. Within the uncertainties of various parameters, two scenarios are possible. For sufficiently weak rheology or large melt region size, evolution is characterized by rapid extrusion and formation of a global magma ocean. For sufficiently strong rheology or small melt region size, in situ crystallization to a partially molten solid state occurs prior to isostatic adjustment. Subsequent to in situ crystallization, local magma ocean evolution depends on melt region size and efficiency of lateral redistribution compared to bulk conductive cooling. For large melt regions, lateral spreading occurs via plastic deformation and results in an asymmetric, global, partial melt layer. For small melt region size, viscous spreading viscous can result in bulk cooling below the solidus prior to formation of a global layer. A hypothesis for the origin of the hemispherical crustal dichotomy and Tharsis rise is suggested. The dichotomy is associated with a global partial melt layer produced by evolution of a large, local magma ocean. After dichotomy formation, evolution of a second, smaller, local magma ocean is related to Tharsis development.},

@article{Licht16,
	abstract = {The thermal history and internal structure of chondritic planetesimals, assembled before the giant impact phase of chaotic growth, potentially yield important implications for the final composition and evolution of terrestrial planets. These parameters critically depend on the internal balance of heating versus cooling, which is mostly determined by the presence of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), such as 26Al and 60Fe, as well as the heat conductivity of the material. The heating by SLRs depends on their initial abundances, the formation time of the planetesimal and its size. It has been argued that the cooling history is determined by the porosity of the granular material, which undergoes dramatic changes via compaction processes and tends to decrease with time. In this study we assess the influence of these parameters on the thermo-mechanical evolution of young planetesimals with both 2D and 3D simulations. Using the code family i2elvis/i3elvis we have run numerous 2D and 3D numerical finite-difference fluid dynamic models with varying planetesimal radius, formation time and initial porosity. Our results indicate that powdery materials lowered the threshold for melting and convection in planetesimals, depending on the amount of SLRs present. A subset of planetesimals retained a powdery surface layer which lowered the thermal conductivity and hindered cooling. The effect of initial porosity was small, however, compared to those of planetesimal size and formation time, which dominated the thermo-mechanical evolution and were the primary factors for the onset of melting and differentiation. We comment on the implications of this work concerning the structure and evolution of these planetesimals, as well as their behavior as possible building blocks of terrestrial planets.},

The aggregate elastic moduli calculated from measured single-crystal elastic moduli and from the average polycrystalline velocities are in excellent agreement. This convincingly demonstrates that accurate values of elastic moduli can be obtained for polycrystalline samples of dense anisotropic materials by Brillouin spectroscopy. Our new values of the bulk modulus (KS = 253(3) GPa) and shear modulus (μ = 175(2) GPa) are ∼4\% and ∼1\% lower than commonly accepted values for end-member MgSiO3 perovskite (KS = 264 GPa, μ = 177 GPa). These lower elastic moduli suggest that the pressure, temperature, and compositional dependence of elastic moduli and wave velocities for magnesian silicate perovskite must be reevaluated in order to obtain reliable constraints on the mantle chemistry and thermal structure.},

abstract = {Crystallization and chemical differentiation of the early Earth was governed by a combination of various processes. Within the uncertainties of physical parameters, the two end-member models, equilibrium crystallization and fractional crystallization, are both possible. In terms of crystal size, the boundary between these models is ∼1mm. Analysis of nucleation and crystal growth in the convecting magma ocean suggests that the crystals in the magma ocean are approximately this size. The equilibrium model is preferred because it seems to satisfy better the geochemical constraints. According to this model, at the early stages crystallization proceeds from bottom up without any substantial crystal-melt segregation. In a vigorously convecting magma ocean the thermal profile is approximately adiabatic and the crystal fraction decreases gradually with depth. The basic physical reason for equilibrium crystallization is a fast convective cooling during which the solid and the liquid phases had a very limited time window for crystal-melt segregation, about 1000 years. Chemical differentiation due to crystal-melt segregation is more significant at low pressures corresponding – with large uncertainties – to the upper mantle. It is caused by several factors. When the temperature drops below liquidus everywhere the nucleation–growth–dissolution cycle of crystals changes to continuous crystal growth. This increases the crystal size to ∼1cm indicating the beginning of crystal-melt segregation. When the crystal fraction increases to about 60% near the surface, the convective heat transport is controlled by solid-state creep which is many orders of magnitude slower. Crystal-melt segregation occurs via melt percolation, which is consistent with the geochemical constraints. Crystallization of the remaining partially molten layers takes about 107–109 years. This stage merges with the subsequent planetary evolution controlled by mantle convection and radiogenic heating. The long lifetime of the shallow magma ocean suggests that this might be the place where liquid iron equilibrates with the mantle before it sinks down to the core.}

@article{Agol_21TRAPPIST,
	abstract = {We have collected transit times for the TRAPPIST-1 system with the Spitzer Space Telescope over four years. We add to these ground-based, HST, and K2 transit-time measurements, and revisit an N-body dynamical analysis of the seven-planet system using our complete set of times from which we refine the mass ratios of the planets to the star. We next carry out a photodynamical analysis of the Spitzer light curves to derive the density of the host star and the planet densities. We find that all seven planets' densities may be described with a single rocky mass--radius relation which is depleted in iron relative to Earth, with Fe 21 wt% versus 32 wt% for Earth, and otherwise Earth-like in composition. Alternatively, the planets may have an Earth-like composition but enhanced in light elements, such as a surface water layer or a core-free structure with oxidized iron in the mantle. We measure planet masses to a precision of 3%--5%, equivalent to a radial-velocity (RV) precision of 2.5 cm s−1, or two orders of magnitude more precise than current RV capabilities. We find the eccentricities of the planets are very small, the orbits are extremely coplanar, and the system is stable on 10 Myr timescales. We find evidence of infrequent timing outliers, which we cannot explain with an eighth planet; we instead account for the outliers using a robust likelihood function. We forecast JWST timing observations and speculate on possible implications of the planet densities for the formation, migration, and evolution of the planet system.},

@article{radreview,
	abstract = {In addition to long-lived radioactive nuclei like U and Th isotopes, which have been used to measure the age of theGalaxy, also radioactive nuclei with half-lives between 0.1 and 100 million years (short-lived radionuclides, SLRs) were present in the early Solar System (ESS), as indicated by high-precision meteoritic analysis. We review the most recent meteoritic data and describe the nuclear interaction processes responsible for the creation of SLRs in different types of stars and supernovae. We show how the evolution of radionuclide abundances in the Milky Way Galaxy can be calculated based on their stellar production. By comparing predictions for the evolution of galactic abundances to the meteoritic data we can build up a time line for the nucleosynthetic events that predated the birth of the Sun, and investigate the lifetime of the stellar nursery where the Sun was born. We then review the scenarios for the circumstances and the environment of the birth of the Sun, within such a stellar nursery, that have been invoked to explain the abundances in the ESS of the SLRs with the shortest lives --- of the order of million years or less. Finally, we describe how the heat generated by radioactive decay and in particular by the abundant 26Al in the ESS had important consequences for the thermo-mechanical and chemical evolution of planetesimals, and discuss possible implications on the habitability of terrestrial-like planets. We conclude with a set of open questions and future directions related to our understanding of the nucleosynthetic processes responsible for the production of SLRs in stars, their evolution in the Galaxy, the birth of the Sun, and the connection with the habitability of extra-solar planets.},

@article{Nikku-review,
	abstract = { Exoplanetary science is on the verge of an unprecedented revolution. The thousands of exoplanets discovered over the past decade have most recently been supplemented by discoveries of potentially habitable planets around nearby low-mass stars. Currently, the field is rapidly progressing toward detailed spectroscopic observations to characterize the atmospheres of these planets. Various surveys from space and the ground are expected to detect numerous more exoplanets orbiting nearby stars that make the planets conducive for atmospheric characterization. The current state of this frontier of exoplanetary atmospheres may be summarized as follows. ▪ We have entered the era of comparative exoplanetology thanks to high-fidelity atmospheric observations now available for tens of exoplanets. ▪ Recent studies reveal a rich diversity of chemical compositions and atmospheric processes hitherto unseen in the Solar System. ▪ Elemental abundances of exoplanetary atmospheres place important constraints on exoplanetary formation and migration histories. ▪ Upcoming observational facilities promise to revolutionize exoplanetary spectroscopy down to rocky exoplanets. ▪ The detection of a biosignature in an exoplanetary atmosphere is conceivable over the next decade. In the present review, we discuss the modern and future landscape of this frontier area of exoplanetary atmospheres. We start with a brief review of the area, emphasising the key insights gained from different observationalmethods and theoretical studies. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the state of the art, challenges, and future prospects in three forefront branches of the area. },

@article{Kreid19LHS,
	abstract = {Most known terrestrial planets orbit small stars with radii less than 60 per cent of that of the Sun1,2. Theoretical models predict that these planets are more vulnerable to atmospheric loss than their counterparts orbiting Sun-like stars3--6. To determine whether a thick atmosphere has survived on a small planet, one approach is to search for signatures of atmospheric heat redistribution in its thermal phase curve7--10. Previous phase curve observations of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e (1.9 Earth radii) showed that its peak brightness is offset from the substellar point (latitude and longitude of 0 degrees)---possibly indicative of atmospheric circulation11. Here we report a phase curve measurement for the smaller, cooler exoplanet LHS 3844b, a 1.3-Earth-radii world in an 11-hour orbit around the small nearby star LHS 3844. The observed phase variation is symmetric and has a large amplitude, implying a dayside brightness temperature of 1,040 $\pm$40 kelvin and a nightside temperature consistent with zero kelvin (at one standard deviation). Thick atmospheres with surface pressures above 10 bar are ruled out by the data (at three standard deviations), and less-massive atmospheres are susceptible to erosion by stellar wind. The data are well fitted by a bare-rock model with a low Bond albedo (lower than 0.2 at two standard deviations). These results support theoretical predictions that hot terrestrial planets orbiting small stars may not retain substantial atmospheres.},

	Abstract = {The Kepler Mission is a space observatory launched in 2009 by NASA to monitor 170,000 stars over a period of four years to determine the frequency of Earth-size and larger planets in and near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars, the size and orbital distributions of these planets, and the types of stars they orbit. Kepler is the tenth in the series of NASA Discovery Program missions that are competitively-selected, PI-directed, medium-cost missions. The Mission concept and various instrument prototypes were developed at the Ames Research Center over a period of 18 years starting in 1983. The development of techniques to do the 10 ppm photometry required for Mission success took years of experimentation, several workshops, and the exploration of many 'blind alleys' before the construction of the flight instrument. Beginning in 1992 at the start of the NASA Discovery Program, the Kepler Mission concept was proposed five times before its acceptance for mission development in 2001. During that period, the concept evolved from a photometer in an L2 orbit that monitored 6000 stars in a 50 sq deg field-of-view (FOV) to one that was in a heliocentric orbit that simultaneously monitored 170,000 stars with a 105 sq deg FOV. Analysis of the data to date has detected over 4600 planetary candidates which include several hundred Earth-size planetary candidates, over a thousand confirmed planets, and Earth-size planets in the habitable zone (HZ). These discoveries provide the information required for estimates of the frequency of planets in our galaxy. The Mission results show that most stars have planets, many of these planets are similar in size to the Earth, and that systems with several planets are common. Although planets in the HZ are common, many are substantially larger than Earth.},

@article{Harrison2021,
	abstract = {{White dwarfs that have accreted planetary bodies are a powerful probe of the bulk composition of exoplanetary material. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model to explain the abundances observed in the atmospheres of 202 DZ white dwarfs by considering the heating, geochemical differentiation, and collisional processes experienced by the planetary bodies accreted, as well as gravitational sinking. The majority (\\&gt;60 per cent) of systems are consistent with the accretion of primitive material. We attribute the small spread in refractory abundances observed to a similar spread in the initial planet-forming material, as seen in the compositions of nearby stars. A range in Na abundances in the pollutant material is attributed to a range in formation temperatures from below 1000 K to higher than 1400 K, suggesting that pollutant material arrives in white dwarf atmospheres from a variety of radial locations. We also find that Solar System-like differentiation is common place in exoplanetary systems. Extreme siderophile (Fe, Ni, or Cr) abundances in eight systems require the accretion of a core-rich fragment of a larger differentiated body to at least a 3σ significance, whilst one system shows evidence that it accreted a crust-rich fragment. In systems where the abundances suggest that accretion has finished (13/202), the total mass accreted can be calculated. The 13 systems are estimated to have accreted masses ranging from the mass of the Moon to half that of Vesta. Our analysis suggests that accretion continues for 11 Myrs on average.}},

Simulating materials behaviour and designing materials to meet prerequisite properties increasingly require insight at the atomistic level.

	abstract = {Phase relations and melt compositions in the CaO--MgO--Al2O3--SiO2--pyrolite under hydrous (2% of H2O) and anhydrous conditions have been determined at 10--25GPa and temperatures from 1400 to 2400$\,^{\circ}$C. At the pressure of 16 and 25GPa the apparent solidus temperatures for the hydrous system are about 200 and 100$\,^{\circ}$C lower than the solidus temperatures for the dry system, respectively. The apparent solidus temperature changes drastically from 1600$\,^{\circ}$C at 13.5GPa to about 1850$\,^{\circ}$C at 16GPa. Majorite is a liquidus phase in the hydrous pyrolite from 10 to 25GPa. The liquidus phases in the dry pyrolite are olivine at 10--14GPa, majorite at 14--20GPa, and periclase at pressures above 20GPa. We observed expansion of the stability field of anhydrous phase B and its complex relations with the other phases in the CMAS--pyrolite system. We suppose it is formed not only by incongruent melting of wadsleyite, but also by the subsolidus reaction of wadsleyite and majorite in the dry condition. Compositions of partial melts formed by low degree of melting (10--20%) have Al2O3-depleted and CaO-rich compositions up to 22GPa and enriched in Al2O3 (5--7wt.%) and CaO at 25GPa. At 10GPa, dry and hydrous melts formed by low degree of melting have high SiO2 (48--51wt.%) and relatively high Al2O3 (3.5--5.2wt.%). Their compositions are generally consistent with those of aluminum-depleted komatiite. At 13--22GPa, dry and hydrous melts have low SiO2 (44--49wt.%) and Al2O3 (1.7--3.0wt.%) and high CaO contents (9--15wt.%). An essential depression of the apparent solidus temperature in the hydrous deep upper mantle compared to that in the transition zone provides the dehydration melting of the hydrous plume. The present results support a model of komatiite genesis by dehydration melting of rising wet plumes at the base of the upper mantle.},

abstract = {In-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments using a multi-anvil apparatus have been conducted on face-centered cubic iron (γ-Fe), which is a possible component of metallic cores in planetary bodies. From the pressure–volume–temperature (P–V–T) data collected systematically at 0–24GPa and 873–1873K, we have constructed the thermal equation of state (EoS) of γ-Fe. A fit with a high-temperature Birch–Murnaghan (HT-BM) EoS yields the unit-cell volume V0, 1273K=49.026(25)Å3, isothermal bulk modulus K1273K=110.8(18)GPa, pressure derivative of the bulk modulus K′=5.3(2), temperature derivative of the bulk modulus (∂KT/∂T)P=−0.0288(17)GPaK−1 and thermal expansion coefficient α=4.50(36)×10−5+1.81(30)×10−8T(K)K−1, respectively, at 0GPa and 1273K. A fit of the Mie–Grüneisen–Debye BM-EoS yields V0, 1273K=49.026(25)Å3, K1273K=111.5(18)GPa, K′=5.2(2), the Grüneisen parameter γ0=2.28(4), and a dimensionless parameter q=−0.21(22), with the fixed Debye temperature θ0=340K. From the present P–V–T data, the spin transformation from mixed- or intermediate-spin to low-spin states is considered to occur with increasing pressure. The successive transition may be subtle, however and its effect on the compression behavior of γ-Fe is relatively small. The newly determined EoS of γ-Fe enables us to more precisely estimate the density of the metallic cores of Mercury, Mars and planetary satellites such as the Moon and Ganymede. The estimated densities of cores in those planetary bodies depend strongly on adapted temperatures in the range of those previously proposed. The metallic cores of those planets as well as that of Earth might contain some other elements such as Ni, S, C, Si, O, and H. The core densities determined in this study provide a reference point to discuss the thermal and compositional structures in planetary and satellite cores when their core densities are determined by future surveys.}

@article{GAIL2014,
	abstract = {Magmatic degassing is ubiquitous and enduring, yet its impact on both planetary surficial chemistry and how it may have varied among planetary systems remains imprecise. A large number of factors are likely to be involved in the control of magmatic gas compositions, leading roles being given to the redox state and volatile abundances in planetary interiors, and the fate of the latter during mantle melting. We however show that the pressure at which degassing occurs, that is the atmospheric pressure in most sensible cases, has a prime influence on the composition of subaerial volcanic gases on planets: high surface pressure produces N2- and CO2-rich and dry volcanic gases, while low pressure promotes sulfur-rich gases. In-between, atmospheric pressures close to 1 bar trigger volcanic gases dominated by H2O. This simple pattern broadly mirrors the atmospheres of Venus--Earth--Mars--Io planetary suite and constitutes benchmarks for the prediction and interpretation of atmospheric features of extra-solar planets. Volatile abundances within the planetary body interiors also matter but they play a secondary role. Furthermore, our analysis shows that any difference in redox conditions prevailing during partial melting tends to disappear with the degassing process itself, converging toward a unique -- planetary oxygen fugacity -- at the venting pressure. A feedback relationship between volcanic gas compositions and atmospheric pressure implies a runaway drying during atmospheric growth; that is volcanic gases must become CO2 richer as the atmospheric mass increases. This may explain some features of the Venusian atmosphere. On Earth, impact ejection of the atmosphere and CO2-sink mechanisms, such as carbonate precipitation and plate tectonics, must have decreased atmospheric pressure allowing the reestablishment of water-rich volcanic gases.},

abstract="Architecture-based adaptation equips a software-intensive system with a feedback loop that enables the system to adapt itself at runtime to changes to maintain its required quality goals. To guarantee the required goals, existing adaptation approaches apply exhaustive verification techniques at runtime. However these approaches are restricted to small-scale settings, which often limits their applicability in practice. To tackle this problem, we introduce an innovative architecture-based adaptation approach to solve a concrete practical problem of VersaSense: automating the management of Internet-of-Things (IoT). The approach, called MARTAS, equips a software system with a feedback loop that employs Models At Run Time and Statistical techniques to reason about the system and adapt it to ensure the required goals. We apply MARTAS to a building security case system, which is a representative IoT system deployed by VersaSense. The application comprises a set of IoT devices that communicate sensor data over a time synchronized smart mess network to a central monitoring facility. We demonstrate how MARTAS outperforms a conservative approach that is typically applied in practice and a state-of-the-art adaptation approach for different quality goals, and we report lessons learned from this industrial case.",

Instead of dealing with a wide range of topics associated with the field, we focus on four essential topics of self-adaptation: design space for self-adaptive solutions, software engineering processes for self-adaptive systems, from centralized to decentralized control, and practical run-time verification {\&} validation for self-adaptive systems. For each topic, we present an overview, suggest future directions, and focus on selected challenges. This paper complements and extends a previous roadmap on software engineering for self-adaptive systems published in 2009 covering a different set of topics, and reflecting in part on the previous paper. This roadmap is one of the many results of the Dagstuhl Seminar 10431 on Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems, which took place in October 2010.",

One highly relevant application domain for self-adaptation is the Internet-of-Things (IoT). While some initial exemplars have been proposed for IoT, these exemplars are limited in scope to support research in realistic IoT domains, such as smart cities. To address this limitation, we introduce the DingNet exemplar, a reference implementation for research on self-adaptation in the domain of IoT. DingNet offers a simulator that maps directly to a physical IoT system that is deployed in the area of Leuven, Belgium. DingNet models a set of geographically distributed gateways, which are connected to a user application that is deployed at a front-end server. The gateways can interact over a LoRaWAN network with local stationary and mobile motes that can be equipped with sensors and actuators. The exemplar comes with a set of scenarios for comparing the effectiveness of different self-adaptive solutions. We illustrate how the exemplar is used for a typical adaptation problem of smart city IoT application, where mobile motes dynamically have to adapt their communication settings to ensure reliable and energy efficient communication.},

abstract = {Explainable machine learning offers the potential to provide stakeholders with insights into model behavior by using various methods such as feature importance scores, counterfactual explanations, or influential training data. Yet there is little understanding of how organizations use these methods in practice. This study explores how organizations view and use explainability for stakeholder consumption. We find that, currently, the majority of deployments are not for end users affected by the model but rather for machine learning engineers, who use explainability to debug the model itself. There is thus a gap between explainability in practice and the goal of transparency, since explanations primarily serve internal stakeholders rather than external ones. Our study synthesizes the limitations of current explainability techniques that hamper their use for end users. To facilitate end user interaction, we develop a framework for establishing clear goals for explainability. We end by discussing concerns raised regarding explainability.},

In this work, we make the first attempt to theoretically understand the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm (Mnih et al., 2015) from both algorithmic and statistical perspectives. In specific, we focus on the fitted Q iteration (FQI) algorithm with deep neural networks, which is a slight simplification of DQN that captures the tricks of experience replay and target network used in DQN. Under mild assumptions, we establish the algorithmic and statistical rates of convergence for the action-value functions of the iterative policy sequence obtained by FQI. In particular, the statistical error characterizes the bias and variance that arise from approximating the action-value function using deep neural network, while the algorithmic error converges to zero at a geometric rate. As a byproduct, our analysis provides justifications for the techniques of experience replay and target network, which are crucial to the empirical success of DQN. Furthermore, as a simple extension of DQN, we propose the Minimax-DQN algorithm for zero-sum Markov game with two players, which is deferred to the appendix due to space limitations.}

abstract = {Increasingly, software systems should self-adapt to satisfy new requirements and environmental conditions that may arise after deployment. Due to their high complexity, adaptive programs are difficult to specify, design, verify, and validate. Moreover, the current lack of reusable design expertise that can be leveraged from one adaptive system to another further exacerbates the problem. We studied over thirty adaptation-related research and project implementations available from the literature and open sources to harvest adaptation-oriented design patterns that support the development of adaptive systems. These adaptation-oriented patterns facilitate the separate development of the functional and adaptive logic. In order to support the assurance of adaptive systems, each design pattern includes templates that formally specify invariant properties of adaptive systems. To demonstrate their usefulness, we have applied a subset of our adaptation-oriented patterns to the design and implementation of ZAP.com, an adaptive news web server.},

abstract="Design patterns document a field's systematic knowledge derived from experiences. Despite the vast body of work in the field of multi-agent systems (MAS), design patterns for MAS are not popular among software practitioners. As MAS have features that are widely considered as key to engineering complex distributed applications, it is important to provide a clear overview of existing patterns to make this knowledge accessible. To that end, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) covering the main publication venues of the field since 1998, resulting in 206 patterns. The study shows that (1) there is a lack of a standard template for documenting design patterns for MAS, which hampers the use of patterns by practitioners, (2) associations between patterns are poorly described, which results in a lack of overview of the pattern space, (3) patterns for MAS have been used for a variety of application domains, which underpins their high potential for practitioners, and (4) classifications of design patterns for MAS are bounded to specific pattern catalogs, a more holistic view on the pattern space is missing. From our study, we outline a number of guidelines that are important for future work on design patterns for MAS and their adoption in practice.",

In this report we describe a remote-access computer system---THE ALOHA SYSTEM---under development as part of that research program and discuss some advantages of radio communications over conventional wire communications for interactive users of a large computer system. Although THE ALOHA SYSTEM research program is composed of a large number of research projects, in this report we shall be concerned primarily with a novel form of random-access radio communications developed for use within THE ALOHA SYSTEM.},

ABSTRACT = {LoRaWAN is one of the low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies that have received significant attention by the research community in the recent years. It offers low-power, low-data rate communication over a wide range of covered area. In the past years, the number of publications regarding LoRa and LoRaWAN has grown tremendously. This paper provides an overview of research work that has been published from 2015 to September 2018 and that is accessible via Google Scholar and IEEE Explore databases. First, a detailed description of the technology is given, including existing security and reliability mechanisms. This literature overview is structured by categorizing papers according to the following topics: (i) physical layer aspects; (ii) network layer aspects; (iii) possible improvements; and (iv) extensions to the standard. Finally, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis is presented along with the challenges that LoRa and LoRaWAN still face.},

This paper describes decentralised coordination mechanisms such as gradient fields as design patterns, similar to patterns used in mainstream software engineering. As a consequence, a structured consolidation of best practice in using each coordination mechanism becomes available to guide engineers in applying them, and to directly decide which mechanisms are promising to solve a certain problem. As such, self-organising emergent solutions can be engineered more systematically, which is illustrated in a packet delivery service application.",

To promote a systematic reuse of mechanisms featured in self-organising systems, we analyse a selection of design patterns devised from the self-organisation literature. Starting from our reference MAS metamodel, we propose a pattern scheme that reflects the peculiarities of self-organising systems. Then, we provide a complete characterisation of each pattern, with particular attention to the problem description, the solution with respect to our metamodel, the natural systems which have inspired the pattern and known applications.",

abstract = {Self-adaptation enables software to execute successfully in dynamic, unpredictable, and uncertain environments. Control theory provides a broad set of mathematically grounded techniques for adapting the behavior of dynamic systems. While it has been applied to specific software control problems, it has proved difficult to define methodologies allowing non-experts to systematically apply control techniques to create adaptive software. These difficulties arise because computer systems are usually non-linear, with varying workloads and heterogeneous components, making it difficult to model software as a dynamic system; i.e., by means of differential or difference equations. This paper proposes a broad scope methodology for automatically constructing both an approximate dynamic model of a software system and a suitable controller for managing its non-functional requirements. Despite its generality, this methodology provides formal guarantees concerning the system's dynamic behavior by keeping its model continuously updated to compensate for changes in the execution environment and effects of the initial approximation. We apply the methodology to three case studies, demonstrating its generality by tackling different domains (and different non-functional requirements) with the same approach. Being broadly applicable and fully automated, this methodology may allow the adoption of control theoretical solutions (and their formal properties) for a wide range of software adaptation problems.},

Responsibilities for these activities shift from software engineers to the system itself, causing the traditional boundary between development-time and run-time to blur. As a consequence, we argue how the traditional software engineering process needs to be reconceptualized to distinguish both development-time and run-time activities, and to support designers in taking decisions on how to properly engineer such systems.",

abstract = {The development of self-adaptive software requires the engineering of an adaptation engine that controls the underlying adaptable software by feedback loops. The engine often describes the adaptation by runtime models representing the adaptable software and by activities such as analysis and planning that use these models. To systematically address the interplay between runtime models and adaptation activities, runtime megamodels have been proposed. A runtime megamodel is a specific model capturing runtime models and adaptation activities. In this article, we go one step further and present an executable modeling language for ExecUtable RuntimE MegAmodels (EUREMA) that eases the development of adaptation engines by following a model-driven engineering approach. We provide a domain-specific modeling language and a runtime interpreter for adaptation engines, in particular feedback loops. Megamodels are kept alive at runtime and by interpreting them, they are directly executed to run feedback loops. Additionally, they can be dynamically adjusted to adapt feedback loops. Thus, EUREMA supports development by making feedback loops explicit at a higher level of abstraction and it enables solutions where multiple feedback loops interact or operate on top of each other and self-adaptation co-exists with offline adaptation for evolution.},

abstract = {Self-adaptive software systems are capable of adjusting their behavior at run-time to achieve certain objectives. Such systems typically employ analytical models specified at design-time to assess their characteristics at run-time and make the appropriate adaptation decisions. However, prior to system's deployment, engineers often cannot foresee the changes in the environment, requirements, and system's operational profile. Therefore, any analytical model used in this setting relies on underlying assumptions that if not held at run-time make the analysis and hence the adaptation decisions inaccurate. We present and evaluate FeatUre-oriented Self-adaptatION (FUSION) framework, which aims to solve this problem by learning the impact of adaptation decisions on the system's goals. The framework (1) allows for automatic online fine-tuning of the adaptation logic to unanticipated conditions, (2) reduces the upfront effort required for building such systems, and (3) makes the run-time analysis of such systems very efficient.},

The trustworthiness and sustainability of these systems will be vital for our society. However, engineering modern computing systems is complex as they have to: i) operate in uncertain and continuously changing environments, ii) deal with huge amounts of data, and iii) require seamless interaction with human operators. To that end, we argue that both systems and the way we engineer them must become smarter. With smarter we mean that systems and engineering processes adapt and evolve themselves through a perpetual process that continuously improves their capabilities and utility to deal with the uncertainties and amounts of data they face. We highlight key engineering areas: cyber-physical systems, self-adaptation, data-driven technologies, and visual analytics, and outline key challenges in each of them. From this, we propose a research agenda for the years to come.},

While ML techniques enable dealing with several problems in self-adaptation, such as scalable decision-making, they are also subject to inherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on one such challenge that is particularly important for self-adaptation: ML techniques are designed to deal with a set of predefined tasks associated with an operational domain; they have problems to deal with new emerging tasks, such as concept shift in input data that is used for learning. To tackle this challenge, we present lifelong self-adaptation: a novel approach to self-adaptation that enhances self-adaptive systems that use ML techniques with a lifelong ML layer. The lifelong ML layer tracks the running system and its environment, associates this knowledge with the current tasks, identifies new tasks based on differentiations, and updates the learning models of the self-adaptive system accordingly. We present a reusable architecture for lifelong self-adaptation and apply it to the case of concept drift caused by unforeseen changes of the input data of a learning model that is used for decision-making in self-adaptation. We validate lifelong self-adaptation for two types of concept drift using two cases.},

abstract = {Self-improving system integration (SISSY) aims at mastering the challenges of system organisation decisions for subsystems with highly dynamic behaviours. This is achieved by increased decision freedom of these subsystems, i.e., by moving the corresponding design decisions from design-time to run-time and from engineers to the systems themselves. As a result, a more robust and efficient constellation of the overall system organisation is maintained even under the presence of continuous change and disturbed conditions. Appropriate integration decisions require a solid foundation of assessing the current conditions and their dynamics using identifying triggers for a necessary evaluation of their own integration status. With this article, we present mCANDIES, a modular novelty detection technique especially suited for SISSY systems that fulfils exactly these identification tasks. mCANDIES tackles an anomaly or novelty detection problem in a modular way by combining the advantages of different detection approaches by exploiting locality in different regions of the input space — depending on, e.g. the density or location of expected observations. This is augmented with information about changes in the underlying model of the observations, i.e., mCANDIES identifies concept drifts. The corresponding information can then be used to trigger online learning behaviour. We analyse the behaviour of mCANDIES on artificial and real-world data sets and compare it to other techniques from the state of the art.}

abstract="Architecture-based adaptation equips a software-intensive system with a feedback loop that enables the system to adapt itself at runtime to changes to maintain its required quality goals. To guarantee the required goals, existing adaptation approaches apply exhaustive verification techniques at runtime. However these approaches are restricted to small-scale settings, which often limits their applicability in practice. To tackle this problem, we introduce an innovative architecture-based adaptation approach to solve a concrete practical problem of VersaSense: automating the management of Internet-of-Things (IoT). The approach, called MARTAS, equips a software system with a feedback loop that employs Models At Run Time and Statistical techniques to reason about the system and adapt it to ensure the required goals. We apply MARTAS to a building security case system, which is a representative IoT system deployed by VersaSense. The application comprises a set of IoT devices that communicate sensor data over a time synchronized smart mess network to a central monitoring facility. We demonstrate how MARTAS outperforms a conservative approach that is typically applied in practice and a state-of-the-art adaptation approach for different quality goals, and we report lessons learned from this industrial case.",

    abstract = { This paper addresses theoretical, empirical, and analytical studies pertaining to human use, misuse, disuse, and abuse of automation technology. Use refers to the voluntary activation or disengagement of automation by human operators. Trust, mental workload, and risk can influence automation use, but interactions between factors and large individual differences make prediction of automation use difficult. Misuse refers to over reliance on automation, which can result in failures of monitoring or decision biases. Factors affecting the monitoring of automation include workload, automation reliability and consistency, and the saliency of automation state indicators. Disuse, or the neglect or underutilization of automation, is commonly caused by alarms that activate falsely. This often occurs because the base rate of the condition to be detected is not considered in setting the trade-off between false alarms and omissions. Automation abuse, or the automation of functions by designers and implementation by managers without due regard for the consequences for human performance, tends to define the operator's roles as by-products of the automation. Automation abuse can also promote misuse and disuse of automation by human operators. Understanding the factors associated with each of these aspects of human use of automation can lead to improved system design, effective training methods, and judicious policies and procedures involving automation use. }

This paper seeks to discuss the opportunities of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, since implications are expected in this field. The authors pursue the goal of shedding light on the young and mostly undiscovered topic of Industry 4.0 in the context of logistics management, thus following a conceptual research approach. At first, a logistics-oriented Industry 4.0 application model as well as the core components of Industry 4.0 are presented. Different logistics scenarios illustrate potential implications in a practice-oriented manner and are discussed with industrial experts. The studies reveal opportunities in terms of decentralisation, self-regulation and efficiency. Moreover, it becomes apparent that the concept of Industry 4.0 still lacks a clear understanding and is not fully established in practice yet. The investigations demonstrate potential Industry 4.0 implications in the context of Just-in-Time/Just-in-Sequence and cross-company Kanban systems in a precise manner. Practitioners could use the described scenarios as a reference to foster their own Industry 4.0 initiatives, with respect to logistics management."

	Abstract = {Self-adaptive systems have the capability to autonomously modify their behavior at run-time in response to changes in their environment. Self-adaptation is particularly necessary for applications that must run continuously, even under adverse conditions and changing requirements; sample domains include automotive systems, telecommunications, and environmental monitoring systems. While a few techniques have been developed to support the monitoring and analysis of requirements for adaptive systems, limited attention has been paid to the actual creation and specification of requirements of self-adaptive systems. As a result, self-adaptivity is often constructed in an ad-hoc manner. In order to support the rigorous specification of adaptive systems requirements, this paper introduces RELAX, a new requirements language for self-adaptive systems that explicitly addresses uncertainty inherent in adaptive systems. We present the formal semantics for RELAX in terms of fuzzy logic, thus enabling a rigorous treatment of requirements that include uncertainty. RELAX enables developers to identify uncertainty in the requirements, thereby facilitating the design of systems that are, by definition, more flexible and amenable to adaptation in a systematic fashion. We illustrate the use of RELAX on smart home applications, including an adaptive assisted living system.},

abstract="Computing systems are becoming more and more dynamically reconfigurable or adaptive, to be flexible w.r.t. their environment and to automate their administration. Autonomic computing proposes a general structure of feedback loop to take this into account. In this paper, we are particularly interested in approaches where this feedback loop is considered as a case of control loop where techniques stemming from Control Theory can be used to design efficient safe, and predictable controllers. This approach is emerging, with separate and dispersed effort, in different areas of the field of reconfigurable or adaptive computing, at software or architecture level. This paper surveys these approaches from the point of view of control theory techniques, continuous and discrete (supervisory), in their application to the feedback control of computing systems, and proposes detailed interpretations of feedback control loops as MAPE-K loop, illustrated with case studies.",

abstract="The ever-growing complexity of software systems coupled with their stringent availability requirements are challenging the manual management of software after its deployment. This has motivated the development of self-adaptive software systems. Self-adaptation endows a software system with the ability to satisfy certain objectives by automatically modifying its behavior at runtime. While many promising approaches for the construction of self-adaptive software systems have been developed, the majority of them ignore the uncertainty underlying the adaptation. This has been one of the key inhibitors to widespread adoption of self-adaption techniques in risk-averse real-world applications. Uncertainty in this setting is a vaguely understood term. In this paper, we characterize the sources of uncertainty in self-adaptive software system, and demonstrate its impact on the system's ability to satisfy its objectives. We then provide an alternative notion of optimality that explicitly incorporates the uncertainty underlying the knowledge (models) used for decision making. We discuss the state-of-the-art for dealing with uncertainty in this setting, and conclude with a set of challenges, which provide a road map for future research.",

abstract="Self-adaptive component-based architectures facilitate the building of systems capable of dynamically adapting to varying execution context. Such a dynamic adaptation is particularly relevant in the domain of ubiquitous computing, where numerous and unexpected changes of the execution context prevail. In this paper, we introduce an extension of the MUSIC component-based planning framework that optimizes the overall utility of applications when such changes occur. In particular, we focus on changes in the service provider landscape in order to plug in interchangeably components and services providing the functionalities defined by the component framework. The dynamic adaptations are operated automatically for optimizing the application utility in a given execution context. Our resulting planning framework is described and validated on a motivating scenario of the MUSIC project.",

abstract="A self-adaptive software system modifies its behavior at runtime in response to changes within the system or in its execution environment. The fulfillment of the system requirements needs to be guaranteed even in the presence of adverse conditions and adaptations. Thus, a key challenge for self-adaptive software systems is assurance. Traditionally, confidence in the correctness of a system is gained through a variety of activities and processes performed at development time, such as design analysis and testing. In the presence of self-adaptation, however, some of the assurance tasks may need to be performed at runtime. This need calls for the development of techniques that enable continuous assurance throughout the software life cycle. Fundamental to the development of runtime assurance techniques is research into the use of models at runtime (M@RT). This chapter explores the state of the art for using M@RT to address the assurance of self-adaptive software systems. It defines what information can be captured by M@RT, specifically for the purpose of assurance, and puts this definition into the context of existing work. We then outline key research challenges for assurance at runtime and characterize assurance methods. The chapter concludes with an exploration of selected application areas where M@RT could provide significant benefits beyond existing assurance techniques for adaptive systems.",

abstract = {Self-adaptation enables a software system to deal autonomously with uncertainties, such as dynamic operating conditions that are difficult to predict or changing goals. A common approach to realize self-adaptation is with a MAPE-K feedback loop that consists of four adaptation components: Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute. These components share Knowledge models of the managed system, its goals and environment. To provide guarantees of the adaptation goals, state of the art approaches propose using formal models of the knowledge. However, less attention is given to the formalization of the adaptation components themselves, which is important to provide guarantees of correctness of the adaptation behavior (e.g., does the execute component execute the plan correctly?). We propose Active FORmal Models for Self-adaptation (ActivFORMS) that uses an integrated formal model of the adaptation components and knowledge models. The formal model is directly executed by a virtual machine to realize adaptation, hence active model. The contributions of ActivFORMS are: (1) the approach assures that the adaptation goals that are verified offline are guaranteed at runtime, and (2) it supports dynamic adaptation of the active model to support changing goals. We show how we have applied ActivFORMS for a small-scale robotic system.},

abstract = {Despite the enormous benefit that has accrued to society from control technology and the continued vitality of control science as a research field, there is broad consensus that the practitioners of control and the academic research community are insufficiently engaged with each other. We explore this concern with reference to the oft-cited theory/practice gap but also from an industry perspective. The core of this article is comprised of ten “messages,” intended primarily for researchers interested in the practical impact of their work, that we hope shed insight on the industry mindset. Results from surveys and other data are cited to underpin the points. Some educational synergies between industry and academia are also noted. To highlight the continuing relevance of control science to industry, several recent examples of successful, deployed advanced control solutions are presented. The authors of this article are members of the IFAC Industry Committee, formally established in 2017 with objectives that include (per the updated IFAC Constitution) “increasing industry participation in and impact from IFAC activities.”}

Of such systems are considered personal and professional service robots which collaborate and interact with humans at diverse applications environments. In this collaboration, human safety is an important factor in the wider field of human-robot interaction (HRI) since it facilitates their harmonic coexistence. The paper at hand aims to systemize the recent literature by describing the required levels of safety during human-robot interaction, focusing on the core functions of the collaborative robots when performing specific processes. It is also oriented towards the existing methods for psychological safety during human-robot collaboration and its impact at the robot behaviour, while also discusses in depth the psychological parameters of robots incorporation in industrial and social environments. Based on the existing works on safety features that minimize the risk of HRI, a classification of the existing works into five major categories namely, Robot Perceptions for Safe HRI, Cognition-enabled robot control in HRI, Action Planning for safe navigation close to humans, Hardware safety features, and Societal and Psychological factors is also applied. Finally, the current study further discusses the existing risk assessment techniques as methods to offer additional safety in robotic systems presenting thus a holistic analysis of the safety in contemporary robots, and proposes a roadmap for safety compliance features during the development of a robotic system.}

abstract = {In forty years, human existence will be radically transformed by advances in information technology, including Artificial Intelligence, robots capable of social agency, and other autonomous physical and virtual systems. Future personality research must assess, understand, and apply individual differences in adaptation to these novel challenges. This review article discusses directions for future personality research. Cross-cultural research provides a model, in that both universal traits and those specific to future society are needed. Evolution of major “etic” trait models of today will maintain their relevance. There is also scope for defining a range of new “emic” dimensions for constructs such as trust in autonomy, mental models for robots, anthropomorphism of technology, and preferences for communication with machines. A more revolutionary perspective is that availability of big data on the individual will revive idiographic perspectives. Both nomothetic and idiographic accounts of personality may support applications such as design of intelligent systems and products that adapt to the individual.}

This paper explores the effectiveness of the technique for large-scale complex IT systems (LSCITS). In particular, we investigate how compositional verification can be used to reverify LSCITS safety properties efficiently after the frequent changes that characterise these systems. We identify several LSCITS change patterns---including component failure, join and choice---and propose an approach that uses assume-guarantee compositional verification to reverify probabilistic safety properties compositionally in scenarios associated with these patterns. The application of this approach is illustrated using a case study from the area of cloud computing.",

abstract = {Context
Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor reflecting technical compromises that can yield short-term benefit but may hurt the long-term health of a software system.
Objective
This work aims at collecting studies on TD and TD management (TDM), and making a classification and thematic analysis on these studies, to obtain a comprehensive understanding on the TD concept and an overview on the current state of research on TDM.
Method
A systematic mapping study was performed to identify and analyze research on TD and its management, covering publications between 1992 and 2013.
Results
Ninety-four studies were finally selected. TD was classified into 10 types, 8 TDM activities were identified, and 29 tools for TDM were collected.
Conclusions
The term “debt” has been used in different ways by different people, which leads to ambiguous interpretation of the term. Code-related TD and its management have gained the most attention. There is a need for more empirical studies with high-quality evidence on the whole TDM process and on the application of specific TDM approaches in industrial settings. Moreover, dedicated TDM tools are needed for managing various types of TD in the whole TDM process.}

abstract = {Background: Self-awareness has been recently receiving attention in computing systems
for enriching autonomous software systems operating in dynamic environments.Objective:
We aim to investigate the adoption of computational self-awareness concepts in autonomic
software systems and motivate future research directions on self-awareness and related
problems.Method: We conducted a systemic literature review to compile the studies
related to the adoption of self-awareness in software engineering and explore how
self-awareness is engineered and incorporated in software systems. From 865 studies,
74 studies have been selected as primary studies. We have analysed the studies from
multiple perspectives, such as motivation, inspiration, and engineering approaches,
among others.Results: Results have shown that self-awareness has been used to enable
self-adaptation in systems that exhibit uncertain and dynamic behaviour. Though there
have been recent attempts to define and engineer self-awareness in software engineering,
there is no consensus on the definition of self-awareness. Also, the distinction between
self-aware and self-adaptive systems has not been systematically treated.Conclusions:
Our survey reveals that self-awareness for software systems is still a formative field
and that there is growing attention to incorporate self-awareness for better reasoning
about the adaptation decision in autonomic systems. Many pending issues and open problems
outline possible research directions.},

abstract = {Architecture-based software performance optimisation can help to find potential performance problems and mitigate their negative effects at an early stage. To automate this optimisation process, rule-based and metaheuristic-based performance optimisation methods have been proposed. However, existing rule-based methods explore a limited search space, potentially excluding optimal or near-optimal solutions. Most of current metaheuristic-based methods ignore existing practical knowledge of performance improvement, and lead to solutions that are not easily explicable to humans. To address these problems, we propose a novel approach for performance optimisation at the software architecture level named Multiobjective performance Optimisation based on Randomised search rulEs (MORE). First, we design randomised search rules (MORE-R) to provide explanation without parameters while benefiting from existing practical knowledge of performance improvement. Second, based on all possible composite applications of MORE-R, an explicable multi-objective optimisation problem (MORE-P) is defined to enlarge search space and enable solutions explicable to architectural stakeholder. Third, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MORE-EA) with an introduced do-nothing rule, innovative encoding and repair mechanism is designed to effectively solve MORE-P. The experiments show that MORE is able to achieve more explicable and higher quality solutions than two state-of-the-art techniques. They also demonstrate the benefits of integrating search-based software engineering approaches with practical knowledge.}

abstract = {While working on a software specification, designers usually need to evaluate different architectural alternatives to be sure that quality criteria are met. Even when these quality aspects could be expressed in terms of multiple software metrics, other qualitative factors cannot be numerically measured, but they are extracted from the engineers know-how and prior experiences. In fact, detecting not only strong but also weak points in the different solutions seems to fit better with the way humans make their decisions. Putting the human in the loop brings new challenges to the search-based software engineering field, especially for those human-centered activities within the early analysis phase. This paper explores how the interactive evolutionary computation can serve as a basis for integrating the humans judgment into the search process. An interactive approach is proposed to discover software architectures, in which both quantitative and qualitative criteria are applied to guide a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The obtained feedback is incorporated into the fitness function using architectural preferences allowing the algorithm to discern between promising and poor solutions. Experimentation with real users has revealed that the proposed interaction mechanism can effectively guide the search towards those regions of the search space that are of real interest to the expert.}

abstract = {Java programmers are faced with numerous choices in managing concurrent execution on multicore platforms. These choices often have different trade-offs (e.g., performance, scalability, and correctness guarantees). This paper analyzes an additional dimension, energy consumption. It presents an empirical study aiming to illuminate the relationship between the choices and settings of thread management constructs and energy consumption. We consider three important thread management constructs in concurrent programming: explicit thread creation, fixed-size thread pooling, and work stealing. We further shed light on the energy/performance trade-off of three ``tuning knobs'' of these constructs: the number of threads, the task division strategy, and the characteristics of processed data. Through an extensive experimental space exploration over real-world Java programs, we produce a list of findings about the energy behaviors of concurrent programs, which are not always obvious. The study serves as a first step toward improving energy efficiency of concurrent programs on parallel architectures.},

GREENS 2018 is co-located with the 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2018).The GREENS workshop provides a forum for practitioners and academics to share knowledge, ideas, practices, and current results related to green and sustainable software engineering. Engineering green software-intensive systems is critical in our drive towards a sustainable, smarter planet. The goal of green software engineering is to apply green principles to the design and operation of software-intensive systems. Green and self-greening software systems have tremendous potential to decrease energy consumption. Moreover, enterprise software can and should be re-thought to address sustainability issues using innovative business models, processes, and incentives. Monitoring and measuring the greenness of software is critical towards the notion of sustainable and green software. Demonstrating improvement is paramount for users to achieve and affect change. The GREENS 2018 theme is design patterns and reference architecture for green and sustainable software. Analysis of the sustainability of a specific software system requires software developers to weigh four major dimensions of sustainability - economic, social, environmental, and technical - which affects their trade-offs. The software engineering community must assume leadership in this important challenge.},

VOLUME = {6},

NUMBER = {1},

ABSTRACT = {This work presents an estimation of the global electricity usage that can be ascribed to Communication Technology (CT) between 2010 and 2030. The scope is three scenarios for use and production of consumer devices, communication networks and data centers. Three different scenarios, best, expected, and worst, are set up, which include annual numbers of sold devices, data traffic and electricity intensities/efficiencies. The most significant trend, regardless of scenario, is that the proportion of use-stage electricity by consumer devices will decrease and will be transferred to the networks and data centers. Still, it seems like wireless access networks will not be the main driver for electricity use. The analysis shows that for the worst-case scenario, CT could use as much as 51% of global electricity in 2030. This will happen if not enough improvement in electricity efficiency of wireless access networks and fixed access networks/data centers is possible. However, until 2030, globally-generated renewable electricity is likely to exceed the electricity demand of all networks and data centers. Nevertheless, the present investigation suggests, for the worst-case scenario, that CT electricity usage could contribute up to 23% of the globally released greenhouse gas emissions in 2030.},

abstract = {ICT Innovations for Sustainability is an investigation of how information and communication technology can contribute to sustainable development. It presents clear definitions of sustainability, suggesting conceptual frameworks for the positive and negative effects of ICT on sustainable development. It reviews methods of assessing the direct and indirect impact of ICT systems on energy and materials demand, and examines the results of such assessments. In addition, it investigates ICT-based approaches to supporting sustainable patterns of production and consumption, analyzing them at various levels of abstraction from end-user devices, Internet infrastructure, user behavior, and social practices to macro-economic indicators.Combining approaches from Computer Science, Information Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, Economics, and Environmental Sciences, the book presents a new, holistic perspective on ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S). It is an indispensable resource for anyone working in the area of ICT for Energy Efficiency, Life Cycle Assessment of ICT, Green IT, Green Information Systems, Environmental Informatics, Energy Informatics, Sustainable HCI, or Computational Sustainability.}

Predictive building control promises to contribute to that by increasing the efficiency of building operations. Predictive control complements other means to increase performance such as refurbishments as well as modernizations of systems. This survey reviews recent works and contextualizes these with the current state of the art of interrelated topics in data handling, building automation, distributed control, and semantics. The comprehensive overview leads to seven research questions guiding future research directions.}

In this paper, we survey the advancement of CPSS through cyber-physical systems (CPS), cyber-social ​systems (CSS) and CPSS, as well as related techniques. CPSS are still at their infancy, most recent studies are application-specific and lack of systematic design methodology. To exploit the design methodology for CPSS, we review the existing system-level design methodologies in multiple application domains and further compare their performance characteristics and applicability for CPSS. Finally, we introduce our latest research advancement on system-level design methodology for CPSS and summarize future challenges for designing CPSS.}

abstract = {“Self-improving system integration” (SISSY) is a research initiative that aims to master the ever-changing demands of system organisation in the presence of highly-dynamic autonomous subsystems, evolving architectures, and unpredictable open environments. In contrast to traditional system modelling, design and development – typically performed by engineers, offline – the SISSY vision promotes automated integration-related decisions, performed during run-time. This implies a change of responsibilities, from engineers to the system itself, which must now find ways to restructure and reassemble itself so as to achieve its objectives. In addition to self-integrating and self-improving internally, such systems must equally be able to cooperate or co-exist with other autonomous systems, which may dynamically join a shared environment. In this editorial, we briefly introduce the ‘self-improving system integration’ initiative and summarise the contents of this special issue.}

abstract = {The research initiative “self-improving system integration” (SISSY) was established with the goal to master the ever-changing demands of system organisation in the presence of autonomous subsystems, evolving architectures, and highly-dynamic open environments. It aims to move integration-related decisions from design-time to run-time, implying a further shift of expertise and responsibility from human engineers to autonomous systems. This introduces a qualitative shift from existing self-adaptive and self-organising systems, moving from self-adaptation based on predefined variation types, towards more open contexts involving novel autonomous subsystems, collaborative behaviours, and emerging goals. In this article, we revisit existing SISSY research efforts and establish a corresponding terminology focusing on how SISSY relates to the broad field of integration sciences. We then investigate SISSY-related research efforts and derive a taxonomy of SISSY technology. This is concluded by establishing a research road-map for developing operational self-improving self-integrating systems.}

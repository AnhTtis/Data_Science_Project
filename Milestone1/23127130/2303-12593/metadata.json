    "abstract": "Topological states have been widely investigated in different types of systems and lattices. In the present work, we report on topological edge states in double-wave (DW) chains, which can be described by a generalized Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model. For the specific system of a driven-dissipative exciton polariton system we show that in such potential chains, different types of edge states can form. For resonant optical excitation, we further find that the optical nonlinearity leads to a multistability of different edge states. This includes topologically protected edge states evolved directly from individual linear eigenstates as well as additional edge states that originate from nonlinearity-induced localization of bulk states. Extending the system into two dimensions (2D) by stacking horizontal DW chains in the vertical direction, we also create 2D multi-wave lattices. In such 2D lattices multiple Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains appear along the vertical direction. The combination of DW chains in the horizontal and SSH chains in the vertical direction then results in the formation of higher-order topological insulator corner states.",

    "abstract": "We give an exact matrix product steady state and matrix product forms of local observables for the bulk impurity-doped XXZ spin model coupled to dissipators at both ends, whose dynamics is described by the Lindblad quantum master equation. We find that local magnetization is induced at the impurity site when the spin current flows, which is contrary to the usual situation where current suppresses magnetization due to heating. It is proved that this current-induced magnetization survives in the thermodynamic limit, and the spin current does not depend on the impurity strength. We discuss the role of bulk integrability by comparing the results with those of non-integrable models solved numerically by the quantum trajectory method.",

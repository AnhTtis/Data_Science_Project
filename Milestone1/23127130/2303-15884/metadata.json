    "abstract": "Extended affine root systems appear as the root systems of extended affine Lie algebras. A subclass of extended affine root systems, whose elements are called ``minimal\" turns out to be of special interest mostly because of the geometric properties of their Weyl groups; they posses the so called ``the presentation by conjugation\". In this work we give a characterization of minimal extended affine root systems in terms of ``minimal reflectable bases\" which resembles the concept of the ``base\" for finite and affine root systems. As an application, we construct elliptic Lie algebras by means of a Serre's type generators and relations.",

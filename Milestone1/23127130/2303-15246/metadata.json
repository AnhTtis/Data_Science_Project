    "abstract": "We demonstrate that cell resampling can eliminate the bulk of negative event weights in large event samples of high multiplicity processes without discernible loss of accuracy in the predicted observables. The application of cell resampling to much larger data sets and higher multiplicity processes such as vector boson production with up to five jets has been made possible by improvements in the method paired with drastic enhancement of the computational efficiency of the implementation.",

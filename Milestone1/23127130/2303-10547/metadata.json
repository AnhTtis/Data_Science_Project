    "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the distributed privacy preserving weighted consensus control problem for linear continuous-time multi-agent systems under the event-triggering communication mode. A novel event-triggered privacy preserving consensus scheme is proposed, which can be divided into three phases. First, for each agent, an event-triggered mechanism is designed to determine whether the current state is transmitted to the corresponding neighbor agents, which avoids the frequent real-time communication. Then, to protect the privacy of initial states from disclosure, the edge-based mutually independent standard white noise is added to each communication channel. Further, to attenuate the effect of noise on consensus control, we propose a stochastic approximation type protocol for each agent. By using the tools of stochastic analysis and graph theory, the asymptotic property and convergence accuracy of consensus error is analyzed. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

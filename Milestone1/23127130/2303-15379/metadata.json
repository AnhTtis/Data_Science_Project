    "abstract": "We consider the online $k$-median clustering problem in which $n$ points arrive online and must be irrevocably assigned to a cluster on arrival. As there are lower bound instances that show that an online algorithm cannot achieve a competitive ratio that is a function of $n$ and $k$, we consider a beyond worst-case analysis model in which the algorithm is provided a priori with a predicted budget $B$ that upper bounds the optimal objective value. We give an algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio that is exponential in the the number $k$ of clusters, and show that the competitive ratio of every algorithm must be linear in $k$. To the best of our knowledge this is the first investigation in the literature that considers cluster consistency using competitive analysis.",

        \textbf{Top:} To tackle the reliance on object annotations of previous interactive segmentation methods caused by interaction simulation, we propose \textbf{M}ulti-granularity \textbf{I}nteraction \textbf{S}imulation (\textbf{MIS}) that simulates interaction by meaningful regions at multiple granularities.
        \textbf{Down:} The model learns from MIS to successfully understand interactions and produce acceptable segmentation.

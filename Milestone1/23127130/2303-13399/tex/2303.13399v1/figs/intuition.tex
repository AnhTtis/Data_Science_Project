        \textbf{Illustration of the multi-granularity region proposal generation.}
        For an input image, We first introduce a self-supervised ViT to produce semantic features for each patch of an image.
        We then gradually merge two similar patches or regions with similar features to perform a new region.
        All newly generated regions in the merging process constitute meaningful proposals at multiple granularities.

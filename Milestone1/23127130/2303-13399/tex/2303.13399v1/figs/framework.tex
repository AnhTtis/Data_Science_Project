        \textbf{Illustration of our unsupervised framework to train an interactive segmentation model.}
        For implementation, the MIS is composed of two stages.
        In the first pre-processing stage, we first parse the semantic of each patch in the image using a pre-trained ViT and take a gradual merging strategy to produce semantic-consistent region proposals at multiple granularities and save them efficiently with a tree structure.
        In the training stage, given an image, we randomly select proposals from the corresponding merging tree in a top-down manner and further simulate possible clicks based on them, thus providing the model informative interactions.

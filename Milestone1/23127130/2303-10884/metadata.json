    "abstract": "$f(Q,T)$ theory of gravity is very recently proposed to incorporate within the action Lagrangian, the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor along with the non-metricity scalar $Q$. The cosmological application of this theory in a spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous Universe is well-studied. However, our Universe is not isotropic since the Planck era and therefore to study a complete evolution of the Universe we must investigate the $f(Q,T)$ theory in a model with a small anisotropy. This motivated us to presume a locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi-I spacetime and derive the motion equations. We analyse the model candidate $f(Q,T)=αQ^{n+1}+βT$, and to constrain the parameter $n$, we employ the statistical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with the Bayesian approach using two independent observational datasets, namely, the Hubble datasets, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) datasets.",

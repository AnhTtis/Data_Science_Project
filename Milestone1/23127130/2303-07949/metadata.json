    "abstract": "An important facet of the inverse eigenvalue problem for graphs is to determine the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues of a particular graph. We resolve this question for the join of a connected graph with a path. We then focus on bordering a matrix and attempt to control the change in the number of distinct eigenvalues induced by this operation. By applying bordering techniques to the join of graphs, we obtain numerous results on the nature of the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues as vertices are joined to a fixed graph.",

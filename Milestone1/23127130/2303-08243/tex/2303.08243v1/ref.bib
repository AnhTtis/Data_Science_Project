abstract="This chapter proposes a hierarchical navigation system combining the benefits of perception space local planning and allocentric global planning. Perception space permits computationally efficient 3D collision checking, enabling safe navigation in environments that do not meet the conditions assumed by traditional navigation systems based on planar laser scans. Contributions include approaches for scoring and collision checking trajectories in perception space. Benchmarking results show the advantages of perception space collision checking over popular alternatives in the context of real-time local planning. Simulated experiments with multiple robotic platforms in several environments demonstrate the importance of 3D collision checking and the utility of a mixed representation hierarchical navigation system."

  abstract={This paper describes a hierarchical fuzzy steering controller approach to local navigation of an autonomous sensor equipped mobile robots. Two goals are considered simultaneously: obstacle avoidance, so that the robot is piloted safely in an unknown environment; and reaching an target point. A two-step approach to build a fuzzy system is presented. In the first stage signals are processed by conventional methods to get an output vector indicating the direction and the closeness of obstacles around. Stage two is a basic task steering controller, that is based on fuzzy logic. The modular structure of the first stage allows modifications on the robot. So there is no need for a redesign of the controller's architecture, when the controller is used in different applications. Adaptation to a new task is done simply by adjusting the controller to other conditions. Then the robustness of this controller is demonstrated in simulations by means of erroneous signals of the sensor modules. Finally the controller is used in combination with another basic task controller for 'Reaching an Aiming Point'. In a higher level a controller ascertains priority of the controllers and manages the resulting steering commands.},

  abstract={Autonomous navigation in unknown cluttered environments is one of the corner-stones of future applications of mobile robots. The complexity even of seemingly simple problems like point-to-point travel, to be solved in real-time, calls for a hierarchical system architecture. The authors present a three-layered path control system with three modules "global planning", "local navigation", and "collision avoidance". Each module is restricted to a subtask of limited competence and responsibility, allowing for on-line implementation within the associated time frame. Suitable module interaction provides the desired behavior of the overall system. This paper summarizes the main idea of each of the three modules. Experimental results with the Siemens mobile platform ROAMER illustrate the methodology and performance of the path control system in unprepared cluttered environments.<>},

  abstract={Over the past decades, the design and development of mission based Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) continues to challenge researchers. Although AUV technology has matured and commercial systems have appeared in the market, a generic yet robust AUV command and control (C2) system still remains a key research area. This paper presents a command and control system architecture for modular AUVs. We particularly focus on the design and development of a generic control and software architecture for a single modular AUV while allowing natural extensions to multi-vehicle scenarios. This proposed C2 system has a hybrid modular-hierarchical control architecture. It adopts top-down approach in mission level decision making and task planning while utilizing bottom-up approach for navigational control, obstacle avoidance and vehicle fault detection. Each level consists of one or more autonomous agent components handling different C2 tasks. This structure provides the vehicle developers with an explicit view of the clearly defined control responsibilities at different level of control hierarchy. The resultant C2 system is currently operational on the STARFISH AUV built at the ARL of the National University of Singapore. It has successfully executed some autonomous missions during sea trials carried out around the Singapore coastal area.},

abstract = {Agents operating in the real world often have limited time available for planning their next actions. Producing optimal plans is infeasible in these scenarios. Instead, agents must be satisfied with the best plans they can generate within the time available. One class of planners well-suited to this task are anytime planners, which quickly find an initial, highly suboptimal plan, and then improve this plan until time runs out. A second challenge associated with planning in the real world is that models are usually imperfect and environments are often dynamic. Thus, agents need to update their models and consequently plans over time. Incremental planners, which make use of the results of previous planning efforts to generate a new plan, can substantially speed up each planning episode in such cases. In this paper, we present an A∗-based anytime search algorithm that produces significantly better solutions than current approaches, while also providing suboptimality bounds on the quality of the solution at any point in time. We also present an extension of this algorithm that is both anytime and incremental. This extension improves its current solution while deliberation time allows and is able to incrementally repair its solution when changes to the world model occur. We provide a number of theoretical and experimental results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches in a robot navigation domain involving two physical systems. We believe that the simplicity, theoretical properties, and generality of the presented methods make them well suited to a range of search problems involving dynamic graphs.}

abstract = {Mobile robots have been used in different applications such as assembly, transportation, and manufacturing. Although, the great work to get the optimum robot's path, traditional path planning algorithms often assume that the environment is perfectly known and try to search for the optimal path that contains sharp turns and some polygonal lines. This paper proposes an efficient, Bezier curve based approach for the path planning in a dynamic field using a Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA). The proposed MGA aims to boost the diversity of the generated solutions of the standard GA which increases the exploration capabilities of the MGA. In our proposed method, the robot's path is dynamically decided based on the obstacles’ locations. With the goal of optimizing the distance between the start point and the target point, the MGA is employed to search for the most suitable points as the control points of the Bezier curve. Using the chosen control points, the optimum smooth path that minimizes the total distance between the start and the end points is selected. Our model was tested on different environments with different scales, different numbers of obstacles, and six benchmark maps. As a result, the proposed method provides an efficient way to avoid robot's energy consumption in harsh environments.}

ABSTRACT = {Multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an imperative role in many real-world applications in a variety of scenarios characterized by a high density of obstacles with different heights. Due to the complicated operation areas of UAVs and complex constraints associated with the assigned mission, there should be a suitable path to fly. Therefore, the most relevant challenge is how to plan a flyable path for a UAV without collisions with obstacles. This paper demonstrates how a flyable and continuous trajectory was constructed by using any-angle pathfinding algorithms, which are Basic Theta*, Lazy Theta*, and Phi* algorithms for a multirotor UAV in a cluttered environment. The three algorithms were modified by adopting a modified cost function during their implementation that considers the elevation of nodes. First, suitable paths are generated by using a modified version of the three algorithms. After that, four Bézier curves-based approaches are proposed to smooth the generated paths to be converted to flyable paths (trajectories). To determine the most suitable approach, particularly when searching for an optimal and collision-free trajectory design, an innovative evaluation process is proposed and applied in a variety of different size environments. The evaluation process results show high success rates of the four approaches; however, the approach with the highest success rate is adopted. Finally, based on the results of the evaluation process, a novel algorithm is proposed to increase the efficiency of the selected approach to the optimality in the construction process of the trajectory.},

abstract = {This study proposes an effective trajectory planning algorithm based on the quartic Bézier curve and dangerous potential field for automatic vehicles. To generate collision-free trajectories, potential field functions are introduced to evaluate the collision risk of path candidates. However, many studies on artificial potential field approaches primarily focus on static and straight roads, and attach less importance to more complex driving scenarios, such as curving roads. In this study, a novel method based on the Frenet coordinate system is proposed to address such limitations. Moreover, to balance the driving comfortability and the driving safety of the path candidate, the path-planning problem is converted to an optimisation problem, and sequential quadratic programming algorithm is employed to tackle this task. Another merit of this algorithm is the curvature of the generated path is continuous even at the joints of adjacent sub-trajectories by utilising several specific properties of the Bézier curve. Furthermore, to execute the generated trajectory, a framework of velocity generation is proposed while vehicle dynamic constraints are considered. Some typical traffic scenarios, including lane-changing, lane-keeping, and collision avoidance have been designed to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, and simulations demonstrate the validity of this method.},

abstract = {Over the past few years maritime sector has witnessed an increasing interest in use of autonomous ships and in particular Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) in complex applications with high associated risks. There is an uprising interest in the development of advanced path planning algorithms for marine vehicles in congested waterways. Availability of an efficient path planning technique that considers the dynamic capabilities of the vehicle is of paramount importance in the implementation of these algorithms. This article reports an early work which aims to contribute to the development of a new generation of path planning that incorporates in its formulation the dynamics of the vehicles and extra data made available by on board sensors about obstacles and other vehicles in vicinity. To this end, Bézier Curves are exploited as the basis for generating a rich set of paths. Then, differential flatness property of the vehicle is used to assign a cost function to each path that reflects the dynamic capabilities of the vehicle on that path. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is shown by help of numerical simulations.}

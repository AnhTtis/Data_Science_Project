The proposed {\saferGap} local planner designs a safe navigation policy for nonholonomic mobile robots. It generates smooth joined B\'{e}zier paths in the collision free space defined by gaps to guarantee safety. We performs NMPC to track the reference path considering nonholonomic dynamics. A synthesized {\keyhole} for the free space is integrated as a safety constraint to prevent collision with obstacles. At the end, keyhole control barrier function provides additional safety at the lowest level of navigation hierarchy. From the simulation benchmark and real experiments, {\saferGap} is demonstrated to achieve safe navigation for nonholonomic robots without losing gap passibility. In the future work, different robot dynamics and environment complexities should be tested to evaluate the robustness of {\saferGap}.

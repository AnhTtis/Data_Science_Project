\begin{abstract}
This paper extends the gap-based navigation technique in {\pGap} by guaranteeing safety for nonholonomic robots for all tiers of the local planner hierarchy, so called {\saferGap}. The first tier generates a B\'{e}zier-based collision-free path through gaps. 
A subset of navigable free-space from the robot through a gap, called the keyhole, is defined to be the 
union of the largest collision-free disc centered on the robot and a trapezoidal region directed through the gap. It is encoded by a shallow neural network zeroing barrier function (ZBF). 
Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), with {\keyhole} constraints and output tracking of the B\'{e}zier path, synthesizes a safe kinematically-feasible trajectory. Low-level use of the 
 {\keyhole}  within a point-wise optimization-based safe control synthesis module
 serves as a final safety layer.
 Simulation and experimental validation of {\saferGap} confirm its collision-free navigation properties.
%. Finally, a control BF point-wise optimization safe control synthesis is employed to act as a last safety measure to cope with a fast-changing environment to which the NMPC loop cannot react within the required time frame.

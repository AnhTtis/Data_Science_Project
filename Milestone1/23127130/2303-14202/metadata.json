    "abstract": "We propose to probe the Higgs boson decay to invisible particles at a muon collider by observing the forward muons that are produced in association with the Higgs in the Z-boson fusion channel. An excellent sensitivity is possible in line of principle, owing to the large number of produced Higgs bosons, provided a forward muon detector is installed. We find that the resolution on the measurement of the muon energy and angle will be the main factor limiting the actual sensitivity. This poses tight requirements on the forward muon detector design.",

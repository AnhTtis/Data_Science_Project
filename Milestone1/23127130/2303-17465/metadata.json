    "abstract": "The dust properties of the line-of-sight materials in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) can be probed by X-ray observations and laboratory experiments. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to conduct a spectral analysis of Chandra ACIS-S/HETG archival data of a sample of LMXBs, including GX 5-1 and GX 13+1. Our MCMC-based analysis puts constraints on the Si K-edge dust properties of the outflowing disk winds in this sample. Further X-ray observations of other LMXBs will help us better understand the grain features of dense outflows and accretion flows in neutron star binary systems.",

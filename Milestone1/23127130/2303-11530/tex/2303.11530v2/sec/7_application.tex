Our work demonstrate practical applications in part based reconstruction and manipulation of articulated objects from images. Given a set of multi-view RGB images of an articulated object, our model predicts precise segmentation masks of \xeable parts in each image. This enables part based 3D reconstruction using masked images for both \xeable parts and the main body of the object. The resulting 3D models of parts allow for easy manipulation of \xeable parts to unseen states in 3D as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:application}.

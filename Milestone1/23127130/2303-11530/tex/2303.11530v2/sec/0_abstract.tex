%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
We introduce the first {\em active learning\/} (AL) framework for high-accuracy instance segmentation of \xeable 
parts from RGB images of {\em real indoor scenes}.
%
As with most human-in-the-loop approaches, the key criterion for success in AL is to minimize human effort while still attaining high 
performance. To this end, we employ a transformer that utilizes a masked-attention mechanism to supervise the active segmentation. 
To enhance the network tailored to \xeable parts, we introduce a {\em coarse-to-fine\/} AL approach which first uses an {\em object-aware\/} 
masked attention and then a {\em pose-aware\/} one, \rz{leveraging the hierarchical nature of the problem and a correlation between \xeable 
parts and object poses and interaction directions.}
%
Our method achieves close to fully accurate (\rqw{96\%} and higher) segmentation results, \rz{with semantic labels}, on real images, with \rqw{82\%} time 
saving over manual effort, where the training data consists of only \rqw{11.45\%} annotated real photographs.
%
At last, we contribute a dataset of \rqw{2,550} real photographs with annotated \xeable parts, demonstrating its superior quality and diversity over 
the current best alternatives.

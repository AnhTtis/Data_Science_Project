%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
We introduce the first {\em active learning\/} (AL) model for high-accuracy instance segmentation of \xeable parts from RGB images of {\em real indoor scenes}.
%
\rzz{Specifically, our goal is to obtain {\em fully validated\/} segmentation results by humans while {\em minimizing manual effort\/}.} To this end, we employ a transformer that utilizes a masked-attention mechanism to supervise the active segmentation. 
To enhance the network tailored to \xeable parts, we introduce a {\em coarse-to-fine\/} AL approach which first uses an {\em object-aware\/} masked attention and then a {\em pose-aware\/} one, \rz{leveraging the hierarchical nature of the problem and a correlation between \xeable parts and object poses and interaction directions.}
%
\rzz{When applying our AL model to 2,000 real images, we obtain fully validated \xeable part segmentations with semantic labels,}
\rzz{by only needing to manually annotate \rqw{11.45\%} of the images. This translates to significant (60\%) time saving over manual effort required by the best non-AL model to attain the same segmentation accuracy.}
%
At last, we contribute a dataset of \rqw{2,550} real images with annotated \xeable parts, demonstrating its superior quality and diversity over \rzz{the best alternatives.}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We advocate active learning as a general and effective means to obtain high-accuracy instance segmentations. It may be the most
viable option to achieve close-to-error-free performance on arbitrary test sets. If properly designed, AL can significantly reduce
human annotation effort for dataset preparation. In this work, we realized both goals for the specific task of instance segmentation
of interactable parts from real scene images containing articulated objects.

Our contribution also includes a high-quality and diverse dataset of annotated real photographs, which we will continue to scale up
to serve the vision community. We would also like to endow the annotated parts with motion parameters. On the technical side, there is
much room to improve on speeding up the correction of erroneous segmentations during AL. Additional priors beyond object poses
may also be explored to facilitate dynamic part segmentation. At last, we would like to extend our AL framework to other motion-
or functionality-aware vision and annotation tasks.

abstract = {Meshless approximations based on moving least-squares, kernels, and partitions of unity are examined. It is shown that the three methods are in most cases identical except for the important fact that partitions of unity enable p-adaptivity to be achieved. Methods for constructing discontinuous approximations and approximations with discontinuous derivatives are also described. Next, several issues in implementation are reviewed: discretization (collocation and Galerkin), quadrature in Galerkin and fast ways of constructing consistent moving least-square approximations. The paper concludes with some sample calculations.}

abstract = {A Lagrangian meshless method is introduced for numerical simulation of flows of incompressible fluids with free surface. Poisson Pressure Equation (PPE) formulation of Navier-Stokes equations is discretised in Lagrangian context using recently introduced spatial operators based on finite differences. The advection adjusts to moving or deforming boundaries, and volume-conservation is enforced by solving a set of geometrical constraints. A technique for detecting the edge or boundary of a point cloud is introduced, which is based on the Laplacian properties for detecting jumps. Since accurate and fast discrete versions of the operator are not straightforward to implement in meshless context, the technique exploits favourable properties of a discrete Laplacian that handles highly irregular arrangements of points. A geometrical scan-sphere test is optionally performed to verify that points are on the point–cloud boundary. The boundary–detection technique is validated on significantly deformed point clouds by artificial numerical experiments, and by simulating unsteady incompressible flows. The method was validated by simulating lid-driven cavity flow, dam-break and water-entry problems, and comparing the kinematics of flow and hydrodynamic loading during the impact. The method reproduced complex free surface shapes, violent fluid-structure interaction, and pressure fields with second-order accuracy.}

The validation of the method is performed by simulating four green-water experiments on fixed and moving structures, and comparing the kinematics of flow and hydrodynamic loads during impacts.

An adaptive rebalancing criterion and monitoring system is developed to integrate the CVP partitioning method as rebalancer to achieve dynamic load balancing of the system. A localized nested hierarchical data structure is developed in cooperation with a tailored parallel fast-neighbor-search algorithm to handle problems with arbitrarily adaptive smoothing-length and to construct ghost buffer particles in remote processors. The concept of “diffused graph” is proposed in this paper to improve the performance of the graph-based communication strategy. By utilizing the hybrid parallel model, the framework is able to exploit the full parallel potential of current state-of-the-art clusters based on Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) architectures. A range of gas dynamics benchmarks are investigated to demonstrate the capability of the framework and its unique characteristics. The performance is assessed in detail through intensive numerical experiments at various scales.}

An evolution of the FD method has been the development of the generalized finite difference (GFD) method, which can be applied over general or irregular clouds of points. The main drawback of the GFD method is the possibility of obtaining ill-conditioned stars of nodes. In this paper a procedure is given that can easily assure the quality of numerical results by obtaining the residual at each point. The possibility of employing the GFD method over adaptive clouds of points increasing progressively the number of nodes is explored, giving in this paper a condition to be accomplished to employ the GFD method with more efficiency. Also, in this paper, the GFD method is compared with another meshless method the, so-called, element free Galerkin method (EFG). The EFG method with linear approximation and penalty functions to treat the essential boundary condition is used in this paper. Both methods are compared for solving Laplace equation.}

abstract = {This paper applies the meshless generalized finite difference method (GFDM) to analyze the subsurface flow problem in anisotropic formations for the first time, and develops the treatment methods of anisotropic permeability tensor in continuous function and discrete distribution expressions respectively. In particular, in case of the common discrete distribution expression of anisotropic permeability tensor in reservoir simulation, this paper suggests combining general difference operators and harmonic average scheme to simply and efficiently obtain the meshless discrete scheme of the anisotropic flow equation. Three numerical examples of steady and transient flow in the rectangular computational domain, transient flow with complex boundary, and steady flow with strongly discontinuous anisotropic permeability are used to verify the high accuracy and good convergence of GFDM to handle anisotropic flow problems. Compared with the traditional mesh-based reservoir numerical simulation method that replies on laborious gridding to discretize the reservoir domain and complicated multi-point flux approximation (MPFA) to handle discrete distribution anisotropic permeability tensor, the meshless GFDM can be more practically applied to the anisotropic flow problems in the reservoir domain with complex geometry and complex boundary conditions. Besides, it is found that the radius of the influence domain has little impact on the accuracy of steady flow. For the transient flow, it generally holds that the larger the radius of the influence domain, the lower the calculation accuracy in case of Cartesian collocation. In sum, this work provides an efficient and simple meshless solver to handle anisotropic flow problems in porous media under GFDM framework, which reveals the great application potential of GFDM in reservoir numerical simulation.}

However for almost inviscid fluids instabilities at the free surface occur due to errors associated with the truncated kernels. A new algorithm is presented which remedies this issue, giving stable and accurate solutions to both internal and free-surface flows. Generalising the particle shifting approach of Xu et al. (2009) [31], the algorithm is based upon Fick’s law of diffusion and shifts particles in a manner that prevents highly anisotropic distributions and the onset of numerical instability. The algorithm is validated against analytical solutions for an internal flow at higher Reynolds numbers than previously, the flow due to an impulsively started plate and highly accurate solutions for wet bed dam break problems at zero and small times. The method is then validated for progressive regular waves with paddle motion defined by linear theory. The accurate predictions demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in stabilising solutions and minimising the surface instabilities generated by the inevitable errors associated with truncated kernels. The test cases are thought to provide a more thorough quantitative validation than previously undertaken.}

In the present study, how those defects can be remedied is illustrated by step-by-step improvements in the respective processes of the revised MPS method. For illustration, two examples are studied; (i) dam breaking problem and (ii) liquid sloshing inside a rectangular tank. The improvement of each step is explained and numerically demonstrated. The numerical results are also compared against the experimental results of Martin and Moyce [12] for dam-breaking problem and Kishev et al. [9] for sloshing problem. The numerical results for violent free-surface motions and impact pressures are in good agreement with their experimental data.}

To improve the effectiveness of PC in removing noisy pressure field, and volume conservation issue of PS, we propose and evaluate several enhancements to these techniques, including a novel dynamic PC technique, and a consistent PS algorithm with new boundary treatments and additional terms (in the continuity and momentum equations). Besides, we introduce modified higher-order and anti-symmetric operators for the diffusive and shear force terms. Evaluation of the proposed developments for violent free-surface flow benchmark cases (2D dam-break, 3D water sloshing, and 3D dam-break with an obstacle) confirms an accurate prediction of the flow evolution and rigid body impact, as well as long-term stability of the simulations. The dynamic PC reduces pressure noises with low energy dissipation, and the consistent PS conserves the volume even for extreme deformations. Comparing the role of these new particle regularization techniques demonstrates the effectiveness of both in assuring the uniformity of the particle distribution and pressure fields; nevertheless, the implementation of PS is found to be more complex and time-consuming, mainly due to its need for free surface detection and boundary treatments with several tuning parameters.}

abstract = {In the present work a consistent inclusion of a particle shifting technique (PST) in the weakly compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) models is discussed. Recently, it has been shown that the use of PST can largely improve both the accuracy and the robustness of SPH models. In particular, the δ+-SPH model is a weakly-compressible SPH model where a PST is adopted along with a diffusive term in the continuity equation that helps removing the high-frequency noise on the pressure field. This specific SPH model is able to overcome the main drawbacks that afflict the standard weakly-compressible SPH model. In this work we demonstrate that a consistent introduction of the PST inside the SPH model leads to a new set of equations where some additional terms containing the particle shifting velocity δu have to be taken into account. The effects of these δu-terms become crucial for problems in confined or periodic domains, as well as for long-time simulations of free-surface flows. The proposed scheme is tested against challenging benchmark cases, highlighting when the δu-terms play an important role or not. Further improvements of the PST algorithms for the numerical treatment of the scheme close to the free surface and along the solid boundaries are also discussed.}

abstract = {The non-conservation of total fluid volume, caused by the accumulating errors on the potential energy of the fluid, has been a serious numerical issue in a Weakly-Compressible SPH (WCSPH) simulation when transitional Particle Shifting Techniques (PSTs) are employed to prevent disordered particle distribution and the tensile instability from negative pressures. This paper is dedicated to, within the framework of WCSPH, developing an enhanced version that remedies the aforementioned deficiency of the traditional PSTs, and meanwhile improves the quality of the particle distribution in the vicinity of a free-surface region. To this end, a Corrective Cohesion Force (CCF) between a target particle and its interacting particles is introduced to provide adaptive compensation corresponding to the particle repositioning. Four classical benchmarks are implemented to validate the effectiveness and stability of the present PST. It is demonstrated that the new PST incorporating with the CCF shows satisfactory performance to improve the conservation of total fluid volume, and to obtain more uniform particle distribution in the proximity of the free-surface. In addition, the newly-developed PST also maintains the accuracy and stability inherited from the traditional versions, suggesting that it can be treated as an ideal alternative with regard to the traditional PSTs in a WCSPH simulation, especially for a long-term-duration case with violent free-surface evolutions.}

abstract = {Mimetic methods discretize divergence by restricting the Gauss theorem to mesh cells. Because point clouds lack such geometric entities, construction of a compatible meshfree divergence remains a challenge. In this work, we define an abstract Meshfree Mimetic Divergence (MMD) operator on point clouds by contraction of field and virtual face moments. This MMD satisfies a discrete divergence theorem, provides a discrete local conservation principle, and is first-order accurate. We consider two MMD instantiations. The first one assumes a background mesh and uses generalized moving least squares (GMLS) to obtain the necessary field and face moments. This MMD instance is appropriate for settings where a mesh is available but its quality is insufficient for a robust and accurate mesh-based discretization. The second MMD operator retains the GMLS field moments but defines virtual face moments using computationally efficient weighted graph-Laplacian equations. This MMD instance does not require a background grid and is appropriate for applications where mesh generation creates a computational bottleneck. It allows one to trade an expensive mesh generation problem for a scalable algebraic one, without sacrificing compatibility with the divergence operator. We demonstrate the approach by using the MMD operator to obtain a virtual finite-volume discretization of conservation laws on point clouds. Numerical results in the paper confirm the mimetic properties of the method and show that it behaves similarly to standard finite volume methods.}

abstract = {This short communication makes the first attempt to apply the generalized finite difference method (GFDM), a newly-developed meshless collocation method, for the numerical solutions of three-dimensional (3D) piezoelectric problems. In the present method, the entire computational domain is divided into a set of overlapping subdomains in which the local Taylor series expansion and moving-least square approximation are applied to construct the local systems of linear equations. By satisfying the coupled mechanical and electrical governing equations, a sparse and banded stiffness matrix can be established which makes the method very attractive for large-scale engineering simulations. Preliminary numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the present method, where the results obtained are compared with the analytical solutions with very good agreement.}

abstract ={We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume ‘overlap’. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code gizmo:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require ‘artificial diffusion’ terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced ‘particle noise’ and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of ‘grid alignment’ effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize ‘grid noise’. These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

abstract="In this paper, we present a Finite pointset method (FPM) for the numerical simulation of free surface flow around a ship in calm water. It is a Lagrangian and meshless particle scheme which is applied to the projection method for the incompressible governing equations. This requires the solution of Poisson problems in each time step, so a moving least squares (MLS) interpolants is used for the spatial derivatives in order to discretize the Poisson equation with pressure-Dirichlet condition of free surface flow in meshless structure. Meanwhile, an additional problem of the periodic particle locations redistribution in the present approach is still handled by MLS interpolants. With the proposed FPM technique, problems associated with the free surface flow around a ship are circumvented. A verification of numerical modeling is made using the Wigley hull and the validity of the proposed methodology is examined by comparing the detail of wave profile and wave-making resistance with Series 60 model. The results demonstrate that FPM is able to perform efficient and stable simulations of free surface flow around a ship.",

abstract="Models to represent in position situations based upon uniform pressure assumptions are well established and have been used extensively in the automotive industry for more than 15 years. More recently, in the beginning of the year 2000, advanced simulation techniques with Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) approaches, such as VPS-PAMCRASH/FPM (Finite Point Method) have been introduced in the development of airbag restraint systems. Their main fields of application are Out Of Position (OOP) situations, where the occupant is close to the airbag casing. For these load cases the deployment kinematics of the airbag and local associated pressures play a major role and require modeling precisely the gas flow. Similarly these techniques are used for side airbags like curtain airbags or knee bags where the deployment kinematics are highly dependent upon local pressures on the membrane of the airbag.The turbulence and viscous flow effects cannot be neglected for curtain bags. It will be shown in this paper that neglecting these effects leads to possible bad prediction of the deployment kinematics.ESI, ITWM and VW have conducted a joint program to extend FPM to turbulent viscous flow simulation, which improves simulation based design also for this category of airbags. The steps of this methodology project will be presented from the academic and scientific work led by ITWM for the introduction and the validation of the k-epsilon turbulence model in FPM to the industrial cases on airbag deployments.Figure 1simulation of airbag deployment using FPM, courtesy Fundacion Cidaut",

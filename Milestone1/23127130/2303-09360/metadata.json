    "abstract": "The COHERENT collaboration observed coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering using a 14.6 kg cesium-iodide (CsI) detector in 2017 and recently published the updated results before decommissioning the detector. Here, we present the legacy determination of the weak mixing angle and of the average neutron rms radius of $^{133}\\mathrm{Cs}$ and $^{127}\\mathrm{I}$ obtained with the full CsI dataset, also exploiting the combination with the atomic parity violation (APV) experimental result, that allows us to achieve a precision as low as $\\sim$4.5\\% and to disentangle the contributions of the $^{133}\\mathrm{Cs}$ and $^{127}\\mathrm{I}$ nuclei. Interestingly, we show that the COHERENT CsI data show a 6$σ$ evidence of the nuclear structure suppression of the full coherence. Moreover, we derive a data-driven APV+COHERENT measurement of the low-energy weak mixing angle with a percent uncertainty, independent of the value of the average neutron rms radius of $^{133}\\mathrm{Cs}$ and $^{127}\\mathrm{I}$, that is allowed to vary freely in the fit. Finally, in light of the recent announcement of a future deployment of a 10~kg and a $\\sim$700~kg cryogenic CsI detectors, we provide future prospects for these measurements.",

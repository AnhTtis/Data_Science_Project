	abstract = {Two detectors making independent observations must decide when a Markov chain jumps from state 0 to state 1. The decisions are coupled through a common cost function. It is shown that the optimal decision is characterized by thresholds as in the decoupled case. However, the thresholds are time-varying and their computation requires the solution of two coupled sets of dynamic programming equations. A comparison to the decoupled case shows the structure of the coupling. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1984 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.},

@article{9,
	abstract = {The output of a discrete-time Markov source must be encoded into a sequence of discrete variables. The encoded sequence is transmitted through a noisy channel to a receiver that must attempt to reproduce reliably the source sequence. Encoding and decoding must be done in real-time and the distortion measure does not tolerate delays. The structure of real-time encoding and decoding strategies that jointly minimize an average distortion measure over a finite horizon is determined. The results are extended to the real-time broadcast problem and a real-time variation of the Wyner-Ziv problem},

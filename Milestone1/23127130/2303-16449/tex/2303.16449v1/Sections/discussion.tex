\section{Discussion}
\label{s:discussion}

In this tutorial we have covered the basics of quantum master equations, showcasing their significance with examples and discussions. The methods reviewed here, such as the GKSL master equation and Bloch-Redfield theory are the cornerstone of stochastic quantum dynamics, and constitute only a small fraction of the developed field of open quantum systems. For further readings on these topics we direct the authors to the following textbooks~\cite{Breuer2002,Nielsen2010,Gardiner2000,gardiner2004quantum,Stenholm2005,Benatti2003,Schlosshauer2007,Bengtsson2006,Rivas2012} and reviews~\cite{Tanimura2006,Rotter2015,Breuer2016,Milz2017}. The power of quantum master equations goes well beyond the considered systems and examples. The theory has been extended to non-Markovian dynamics~\cite{Yu1999,Breuer1999,Yu2004,Ferialdi2016,Piilo2008,Zhang2019b}, non-linear systems~\cite{Kilin1986,Mancal2012}, time-convolutionless master equations~\cite{Pereverzev2006,Nan2009,Timm2011,Kidon2015}, and is in constant development~\cite{Yang2016a,Dominikus2021,Ferguson2021,Wu2022,Davidovic2022,Donvil2022}. 

Further research in this field has been focusing on several aspects, such as extending the applicability of QMEs beyond the standard approximations~\cite{Stenius1996,Whitney2008,Davidovic2020}, the combination of QMEs with compression methods~\cite{Cygorek2022} such as tensor networks~\cite{Werner2016,Xu2019,Jorgensen2019,Fugger2020,Nakano2021}, the use of neural networks~\cite{Hartmann2019,Liu2022}, and the quantum simulation of open system dynamics~\cite{DiCandia2015,Endo2020,Schlimgen2022,Kamakari2022}. These exciting developments are set to expand the range of applicability of QMEs to problems that are typically hard to solve, such as the dynamics of correlated many-body quantum systems that underlie the physics of quantum phase transitions~\cite{DeChiara2018,Heyl2019,Bayha2020,Carollo2020,Rossini2021}, quantum computing architectures~\cite{Wu2021,Brown2021,Bravyi2022,Madsen2022}, optoelectronic devices~\cite{Chenu2015,Scholes2020a}, and complex chemical reactions~\cite{Cao2019,Schroder2019,Mcardle2020,Ye2021}.

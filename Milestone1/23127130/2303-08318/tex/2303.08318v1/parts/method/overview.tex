Our overall framework is summarized in \autoref{fig:overview}. We first propose a semi-supervised classification method to build a tag ontology, solving the ontology construction challenge. We then build the heterogeneous video-tag network for jointly modeling social influence and tag ontology. Afterward, we design the adve\textbf{R}sarial aggregated g\textbf{A}te\textbf{D} gr\textbf{A}ph t\textbf{R}ansformer network (RADAR) to derive a better video and tag representation. The two components of RADAR solve Behavior Spread modeling and visual-linguistic knowledge aggregation challenges respectively. Finally, we estimate the semantic similarity between a micro-video and all tags as our predictions.

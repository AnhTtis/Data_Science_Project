\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this work, we jointly incorporate social influence and tag relations into a user-video-tag network to enhance micro-video tagging.
To construct tag relations, we build a tag ontology based upon tag statistics and graphical constraints in a semi-supervised manner. 
To derive a better node representation in video-tag network, we present RADAR, a heterogeneous GNN composed of a gated graph transformer and adversarial aggregation network. Extensive experimental results on three datasets have demonstrated the superiority of RADAR, and the effectiveness of its two components.

In the future, 
% we plan to incorporate visual features into the tag ontology construction process. Besides, 
we are going to generalize our method to handle more complicated tag knowledge structures. 
As to the Behavior Spread modeling, we plan to model the temporal dynamics of users’ social influence.

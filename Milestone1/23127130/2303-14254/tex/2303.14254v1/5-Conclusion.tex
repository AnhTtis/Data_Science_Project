\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.5em}
We proposed a generic yet effective time-series data augmentation method \our to combine patterns in both the time domain and frequency domain. In the frequency domain, the re-combined subcompacts of the original time series are both diverse and preserve the original basic components. In the time domain, we adapt the mix-up strategy to generate diverse and in-between coherent samples by linearly interpolating both past and future part of a time series. Experiments on five real-world time-series datasets show that \our best reduces the forecasting errors of base model compared with existing augmentation methods. We also performed robustness analysis and observed that \our stays robust with respect to sampling size. 
Our ongoing work in the area involves systematically studying the effectiveness of various time domain and frequency domain augmentation methods, and designing data-dependent selection procedure to choose the most suitable augmentation method for different datasets.

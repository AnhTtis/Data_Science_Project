    "abstract": "We classify the finite dimensional semi-weight representations of the reduced stated skein algebras at odd roots of unity of connected marked surfaces which either have a boundary component with at least two boundary arcs or which do not have any unmarked boundary component. We deduce computations of the PI-degrees and Azumaya loci of unreduced stated skein algebras of essential surfaces having at most one boundary arc per boundary component and of the unrestricted quantum moduli algebras of lattice gauge field theory.",

    "abstract": "The many-body localization (MBL) proximity effect is an intriguing phenomenon where a thermal bath localizes due to the interaction with a disordered system. The interplay of thermal and non-ergodic behavior in these systems gives rise to a rich phase diagram, whose exploration is an active field of research. In this work, we study a bosonic Hubbard model featuring two particle species representing the bath and the disordered system. Using state of the art numerical techniques, we investigate the dynamics of the model in different regimes, based on which we obtain a tentative phase diagram as a function of coupling strength and bath size. When the bath is composed of a single particle, we observe clear signatures of a transition from an MBL proximity effect to a delocalized phase. Increasing the bath size, however, its thermalizing effect becomes stronger and eventually the whole system delocalizes in the range of moderate interaction strengths studied. In this regime, we characterize particle transport, revealing diffusive behavior of the originally localized bosons.",

    "abstract": "Let $F\\subseteq [0,1]^2$ be a Bedford-McMullen carpet defined by exponents $m>n$, that projects to $[0,1]$ on the $y$-axis. We show that under mild conditions on $F$, there are many non principle lines $\\ell$ such that $\\dim^* F\\cap \\ell = \\dim^* F -1$, where $\\dim^*$ is Furstenberg's star dimension (maximal dimension of a microset). This exhibits the sharpness of recent Furstenberg-type slicing theorems obtained by Algom (2020) about upper bounds on the dimension of every such slice.",

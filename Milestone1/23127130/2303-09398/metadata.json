    "abstract": "An $n\\times n$ matrix $M=[m_{ij}]$ with $m_{ij}\\in U_n=\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ will be called a cycle matrix if $(U_n,\\cdot)$ is a cycle set, where $i\\cdot j=m_{ij}$. We study these matrices in this article. Using these matrices, we give some recipes to construct solutions, which include the multipermutation level $2$ solutions. As an application of these, we construct a multi-permutation solution of level $r$ for all $r\\geq 1$. Our method gives alternate proof that the class of permutation groups of solutions contains all finite abelian groups.",

        class occurrence frequency (\textbf{right}). \mae is stronger than \ce at detecting small objects and 
        frequent classes, and is worse on rare classes. \ours outperforms \ce on all axes. It
        is much closer to \mae on smaller objects and rare classes, and also outperforms \mae elsewhere.

\section{Experiments}

We empirically evaluate and analyze large scale \mae \prept using \ig data on a variety of different visual recognition tasks.
We describe the datasets used for pretraining and evaluation, followed by analysis of 
the pretraining design decisions, and finally the downstream transfer evaluation of our learned representation.

The diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in text-based image generation. However, since it contains enormous randomness in generation progress, it is still challenging to apply such models for real-world visual content editing, especially in videos. 
In this paper, we propose \texttt{FateZero}, a zero-shot text-based editing method on real-world videos without per-prompt training or use-specific mask. 
\RM{Specifically, different from a pipeline of two independent inversion and then generation stages, we find the intermediate attention maps during inversions store better structure and motion information. We thus reform them to temporally casual attention and replace them in the generation progress. To further reduce the unnecessary semantic leakage of source video and enhance the editing quality, we then remix the temporally casual attentions via the cross-attention features of the source prompt as the mask.}
To edit videos consistently, we propose several techniques based on the pre-trained models. Firstly, in contrast to the straightforward DDIM inversion technique, our approach captures intermediate attention maps during inversion, which effectively retain both structural and motion information. These maps are directly fused in the editing process rather than generated during denoising. To further minimize semantic leakage of the source video, we then fuse self-attentions with a blending mask obtained by cross-attention features from the source prompt. Furthermore, we have implemented a reform of the self-attention mechanism in denoising UNet by introducing spatial-temporal attention to ensure frame consistency.
Yet succinct, our method is the first one to show the ability of zero-shot text-driven video style and local attribute editing from the trained text-to-image model. We also have a better zero-shot shape-aware editing ability based on the text-to-video model~\cite{tuneavideo}. \RM{Besides video, our unified method also achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot image editing.\chenyang{Need exp or remove the zero-shot image}} Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior temporal consistency and editing capability than previous works.

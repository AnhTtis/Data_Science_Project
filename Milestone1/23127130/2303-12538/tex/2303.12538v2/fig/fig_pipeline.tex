    \caption{The proposed method consists of two image-conditioned diffusion models: LayoutNet and ContentNet. Given an object image, we first use LayoutNet (left) to predict a HOI spatial arrangement $\bm l_0$. For every diffusion step, the LayoutNet splats the noisy layout parameter into image space, concatenates it with the object image and their blending, and predicts the denoised layout. We apply the diffusion loss in the splatted 2D space 
    $\mathcal{L}_{\text{mask}}$. 
    Then the ContentNet (right) takes in the predicted layout along with the object image to synthesize an HOI image. The two modules are connected by the articulation-agnostic hand proxy (middle top).

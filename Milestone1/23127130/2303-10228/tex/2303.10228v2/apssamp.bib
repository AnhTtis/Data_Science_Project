abstract  ="Using density functional theory{,} we investigated the vibrational properties and Raman spectra of pristine blue phosphorene and fluorinated blue phosphorene. The fluorinated blue phosphorene possesses a Dirac cone at the K point (about 310 cm−1). The shape of the Dirac cone remains unchanged under different tensile strains. The Raman tensor and thus angle-dependent Raman intensities of all Raman active modes are calculated for the polarizations of scattered light parallel and perpendicular to that of the incident light. The characteristics of angle-dependent Raman intensities are discussed. Moreover{,} the polarization direction averaged non-resonant Raman spectra of pristine blue phosphorene and fluorinated blue phosphorene are compared with that of germanene and black phosphorene."}

We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

abstract={The advent of two-dimensional (2D) crystals has led to numerous scientific breakthroughs. Conventional 2D systems have in-plane covalent bonds and a weak out-of-plane van-der-Waals bond. Here we report a new type of 2D material composed of discrete magnetic molecules, where anisotropic van-der-Waals interactions bond the molecules into a 2D packing. Through mechanical exfoliation, we can obtain single-crystalline molecular monolayers, which can be readily integrated into other 2D systems. Optical spectroscopy suggests the few-layered molecules preserve the temperature-induced spin-crossover switching observed in the bulk form but show a drastic increase in thermal hysteresis unique to these thin 2D molecule assemblies. The trapping of spin bistability with decreasing layer number can arise from domain wall dynamics in reduced dimensions. Our results establish molecular solids with strong anisotropy of intermolecular interactions as precursors to a new class of 2D materials, affording possibilities to control molecular functionalities through substrate and interlayer interactions.},

In this work, we use Raman spectroscopy to probe structural modifications in amorphous Ta2O5 coatings submitted to thermal annealing. On the basis of previous knowledge on the crystalline material, we perform Raman spectrum simulations in disordered and partially ordered Ta2O5 from a phonon density of states. Calculated spectra are in good agreement with complex experimental spectra. Our original approach allows assignment of the vibrational features of the amorphous material, and quantitative interpretation of observed structural modifications in terms of ordering scales.

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.}

    abstract = "{We discuss several ways in which molecular absorption and scattering spectra can be computed ab initio, from the fundamental constants of nature. These methods can be divided into two general categories. In the first, or sequential, type of approach, one first solves the electronic part of the Schrödinger equation in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, mapping out the potential energy, dipole moment vector (for infrared absorption) and polarizability tensor (for Raman scattering) as functions of nuclear coordinates. Having completed the electronic part of the calculation, one then solves the nuclear part of the problem either classically or quantum mechanically. As an example of the sequential ab initio approach, the infrared and Raman rotational and vibrational‐rotational spectral band contours for the water molecule are computed in the simplest rigid rotor, normal mode approximation. Quantum techniques are used to calculate the necessary potential energy, dipole moment, and polarizability information at the equilibrium geometry. A new quick, accurate, and easy to program classical technique involving no reference to Euler angles or special functions is developed to compute the infrared and Raman band contours for any rigid rotor, including asymmetric tops. A second, or simultaneous, type of ab initio approach is suggested for large systems, particularly those for which normal mode analysis is inappropriate, such as liquids, clusters, or floppy molecules. Then the curse of dimensionality prevents mapping out in advance the complete potential, dipole moment, and polarizability functions over the whole space of nuclear positions of all atoms, and a solution in which the electronic and nuclear parts of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation are simultaneously solved is needed. A quantum force classical trajectory (QFCT) molecular dynamic method, based on linear response theory, is described, in which the forces, dipole moment, and polarizability are computed quantum mechanically, using gradient techniques step by step along a classical trajectory whose path is determined by these quantum forces. We believe the QFCT method to be a more practical ab initio route to spectral band contours for large molecules, clusters, and solutions, and it can be equally applied to equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. It is pointed out that a similar ab initio QFCT molecular dynamic approach could be used to compute other types of spectra, e.g., electronic absorption, as well as other parameters such as transport properties and thermodynamic functions and their quantum corrections. For parameters not depending on momenta, a parallel ab initio Monte Carlo approach would use electronic energies and other parameters of interest generated quantum mechanically, and ‘‘classical’’ trial moves of the nuclei.}",

abstract = {Many of the interesting properties that make Ta2O5 a strategic material for current and future applications in chemistry, microelectronics and optics, depend on its structural characteristics. In this work, we use Raman spectroscopy to probe structural modifications in amorphous Ta2O5 coatings submitted to thermal annealing. On the basis of previous knowledge on the crystalline material, we perform Raman spectrum simulations in disordered and partially ordered Ta2O5 from a phonon density of states. Calculated spectra are in good agreement with complex experimental spectra. Our original approach allows assignment of the vibrational features of the amorphous material, and quantitative interpretation of observed structural modifications in terms of ordering scales. In addition, it provides numerical indicators to analyse amorphous to crystalline phase transformation. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

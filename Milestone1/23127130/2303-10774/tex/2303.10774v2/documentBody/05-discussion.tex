\section{Discussion}
We introduced the first cross-GAN auditing framework, which utilizes a novel optimization technique to jointly infer common, novel and missing attributes for a client GAN w.r.t any reference GAN. Through a large suite of datasets and GAN models, we demonstrate that the proposed method (i) consistently leads to higher quality (disentangled \& diverse) attributes, (ii) effectively reveals shared attributes even across challenging distribution shifts, and (iii) accurately identifies the novel/missing attributes in our controlled experiments (i.e., known ground truth). 

\noindent \textbf{Limitations } 
First, similar to other optimization-based attribute discovery approaches \cite{voynov2020unsupervised}, \cite{yuksel2021latentclr}, there is no guarantee that all prevalent factors are captured, though our controlled empirical studies clearly demonstrate the efficacy of xGA over existing approaches. Second, while using an external feature space enhances the performance of attribute discovery, this becomes an additional component that must be tuned. While we found advBN ResNet-50 to be a reasonable choice for a variety of face datasets (and AFHQ), a more systematic solution will expand the utility of our approach to other applications.

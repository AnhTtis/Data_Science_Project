	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02459},
	abstract = {Indoor localization has drawn much attention owing to its potential for supporting location based services. Among various indoor localization techniques, the received signal strength (RSS) based technique is widely researched. However, in conventional RSS based systems where the radio environment is unconﬁgurable, adjacent locations may have similar RSS values, which limits the localization precision. In this paper, we present MetaRadar, which explores reconﬁgurable radio reﬂection with a surface/plane made of metamaterial units for multi-user localization. By changing the reﬂectivity of metamaterial, MetaRadar modiﬁes the radio channels at different locations, and improves localization accuracy by making RSS values at adjacent locations have signiﬁcant differences. However, in MetaRadar, it is challenging to build radio maps for all the radio environments generated by metamaterial units and select suitable maps from all the possible maps to realize a high accuracy localization. To tackle this challenge, we propose a compressive construction technique which can predict all the possible radio maps, and propose a conﬁguration optimization algorithm to select favorable metamaterial reﬂectivities and the corresponding radio maps. The experimental results show a signiﬁcant improvement from a decimeter-level localization error in the traditional RSS-based systems to a centimeter-level one in MetaRadar.},

	abstract = {The advantages of millimeter-wave and large antenna arrays technologies for accurate wireless localization received extensive attentions recently. However, how to further improve the accuracy of wireless localization, even in the case of obstructed line-of-sight, is largely undiscovered. In this paper, the reconﬁgurable intelligent surface (RIS) is introduced into the system to make the positioning more accurate. First, we establish the three-dimensional RIS-assisted wireless localization channel model. After that, we derive the Fisher information matrix and the Cramer-Rao lower bound for evaluating the estimation of absolute mobile station position. Finally, we propose an alternative optimization method and a gradient decent method to optimize the reﬂect beamforming, which aims to minimize the CramerRao lower bound to obtain a more accurate estimation. Our results show that the proposed methods signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of positioning, and decimeter-level or even centimeterlevel positioning can be achieved by utilizing the RIS with a large number of reﬂecting elements.},

	abstract = {The received signal strength (RSS) based technique is extensively utilized for localization in the indoor environments. Since the RSS values of neighboring locations may be similar, the localization accuracy of the RSS based technique is limited. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose to utilize reconﬁgurable intelligent surface (RIS) for the RSS based multi-user localization. As the RIS is able to customize the radio channels by adjusting the phase shifts of the signals reﬂected at the surface, the localization accuracy in the RIS aided scheme can be improved by choosing the proper phase shifts with signiﬁcant differences of RSS values among adjacent locations. However, it is challenging to select the optimal phase shifts because the decision function for location estimation and the phase shifts are coupled. To tackle this challenge, we formulate the optimization problem for the RIS-aided localization, derive the optimal decision function, and design the phase shift optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve the formulated problem efﬁciently. Analysis of the proposed RIS aided technique is provided, and the effectiveness is validated through simulation.},

	shorttitle = {{MetaRadar}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02459},
	abstract = {Indoor localization has drawn much attention owing to its potential for supporting location based services. Among various indoor localization techniques, the received signal strength (RSS) based technique is widely researched. However, in conventional RSS based systems where the radio environment is unconﬁgurable, adjacent locations may have similar RSS values, which limits the localization precision. In this paper, we present MetaRadar, which explores reconﬁgurable radio reﬂection with a surface/plane made of metamaterial units for multi-user localization. By changing the reﬂectivity of metamaterial, MetaRadar modiﬁes the radio channels at different locations, and improves localization accuracy by making RSS values at adjacent locations have signiﬁcant differences. However, in MetaRadar, it is challenging to build radio maps for all the radio environments generated by metamaterial units and select suitable maps from all the possible maps to realize a high accuracy localization. To tackle this challenge, we propose a compressive construction technique which can predict all the possible radio maps, and propose a conﬁguration optimization algorithm to select favorable metamaterial reﬂectivities and the corresponding radio maps. The experimental results show a signiﬁcant improvement from a decimeter-level localization error in the traditional RSS-based systems to a centimeter-level one in MetaRadar.},

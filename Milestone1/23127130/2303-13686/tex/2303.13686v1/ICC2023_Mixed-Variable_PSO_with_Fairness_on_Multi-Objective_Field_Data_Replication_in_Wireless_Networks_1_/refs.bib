	abstract = {While there has been a recent growth of interest in the Digital Twin, a variety of definitions employed across industry and academia remain. There is a need to consolidate research such to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure future research efforts are to be based on solid foundations. Through a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis of 92 Digital Twin publications from the last ten years, this paper provides a characterisation of the Digital Twin, identification of gaps in knowledge, and required areas of future research. In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.},

	abstract = {Load balancing has become a key technique to handle the increasing traffic demand and improve the user experience. It evenly distributes the traffic across network resources by offloading users from overloaded base stations or channels to less crowded ones. Load balancing is a multi-objective optimization problem involving the automatic adjustment of several parameters to simultaneously maximize multiple network performance indicators. However, the existing methods mostly rely on single-objective approaches which lead to sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework for load balancing. Specifically, we propose a solution based on meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) to learn a general policy capable of quickly adapting to new trade-offs between the objectives. We further enhance the generalization of our proposed solution using policy distillation techniques. To showcase the effectiveness of our framework, experiments are conducted based on real-world traffic scenarios. Our results show that our load balancing framework can (i) significantly outperform the existing rule-based and single-objective solutions, (ii) compute better Pareto front approximations compared to MORL baselines, and (iii) quickly adapt to new objective trade-offs.},

	abstract = {A digital twin (DT) is classically defined as the virtual replica of a real-world product, system, being, communities, even cities that are continuously updated with data from its physical counterpart, as well as its environment. It bridges the virtual cyberspace with the physical entities and, as such, is considered to be the pillar of Industry 4.0 and the innovation backbone of the future. A DT is created and used throughout the whole life cycle of the entity it replicates, from cradle to grave, so to speak. This article focuses on the present state of the art of DTs, concentrating on the use of DTs in industry in the context of smart manufacturing, especially from the point of view of plantwide optimization. The main capabilities of DTs (mirroring, shadowing and threading) are discussed in this context. The article concludes with a perspective on the future.

A population of individuals, which encode the problem solutions are manipulated according to the rule of survival of the fittest through "genetic" operations, such as mutation, crossover and reproduction. A best solution is evolved through the generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques, Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating social behavior (R.C. Eberhart et al., 1996; R.C. Eberhart and J. Kennedy, 1996; J. Kennedy and R.C. Eberhart, 1995; J. Kennedy, 1997). As in other algorithms, a population of individuals exists. This algorithm is called particle swarm optimization (PSO) since it resembles a school of flying birds. In a particle swarm optimizer, instead of using genetic operators, these individuals are "evolved" by cooperation and competition among the individuals themselves through generations. Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience. We introduce a new parameter, called inertia weight, into the original particle swarm optimizer. Simulations have been done to illustrate the significant and effective impact of this new parameter on the particle swarm optimizer.},

	abstract = {Many optimization problems in reality involve both continuous and discrete decision variables, and these problems are called mixed-variable optimization problems (MVOPs). The mixed decision variables of MVOPs increase the complexity of search space and make them difficult to be solved. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is easy to implement due to its simple framework and high speed of convergence, and has been successfully applied to many difficult optimization problems. Many existing PSO variants have been proposed to solve continuous or discrete optimization problems, which make it feasible and promising for solving MVOPs. In this paper, a new PSO algorithm for solving MVOPs is proposed, namely PSOmv, which can deal with both continuous and discrete decision variables simultaneously. To efficiently handle mixed variables, the PSOmv employs a mixed-variable encoding scheme. Based on the mixed-variable encoding scheme, two reproduction methods respectively for continuous variables and discrete variables are proposed. Furthermore, an adaptive parameter tuning strategy is employed and a constraints handling method is utilized to improve the overall efficiency of the PSOmv.The experimental results on 28 artificial MVOPs and two practical MVOPs demonstrate that the proposed PSOmv is a competitive algorithm for MVOPs.},

	abstract = {The pervasiveness of wireless technology has indeed created massive opportunity to integrate almost everything into the Internet fabric. This can be seen with the advent of Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems, which involves cooperation of massive number of intelligent devices to provide intelligent services. Fairness amongst these devices is an important issue that can be analysed from several dimensions, e.g., energy usage, achieving required quality of services, spectrum sharing, and so on. This article focusses on these viewpoints while looking at fairness research. To generalize, mainly wireless networks are considered. First, we present a general view of fairness studies, and pose three core questions that help us delineate the nuances in defining fairness. Then, the existing fairness models are summarized and compared. We also look into the major fairness research domains in wireless networks such as fair energy consumption control, power control, topology control, link and flow scheduling, channel assignment, rate allocation, congestion control and routing protocols. We make a distinction amongst fairness, utility and resource allocation to begin with. Later, we present their inter-relation. At the end of this article, we list the common properties of fairness and give an example of fairness management. Several open research challenges that point to further work on fairness in wireless networks are also discussed. Indeed, the research on fairness is entangled with many other aspects such as performance, utility, optimization and throughput at the network and node levels. While consolidating the contributions in the literature, this article tries to explain the niceties of all these aspects in the domain of wireless networking.},

	abstract = {As of today, the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication system has been rolled out in many countries and the number of 5G subscribers already reaches a very large scale. It is time for academia and industry to shift their attention towards the next generation. At this crossroad, an overview of the current state of the art and a vision of future communications are definitely of interest. This article thus aims to provide a comprehensive survey to draw a picture of the sixth generation (6G) system in terms of drivers, use cases, usage scenarios, requirements, key performance indicators (KPIs), architecture, and enabling technologies. First, we attempt to answer the question of “Is there any need for 6G?” by shedding light on its key driving factors, in which we predict the explosive growth of mobile traffic until 2030, and envision potential use cases and usage scenarios. Second, the technical requirements of 6G are discussed and compared with those of 5G with respect to a set of KPIs in a quantitative manner. Third, the state-of-the-art 6G research efforts and activities from representative institutions and countries are summarized, and a tentative roadmap of definition, specification, standardization, and regulation is projected. Then, we identify a dozen of potential technologies and introduce their principles, advantages, challenges, and open research issues. Finally, the conclusions are drawn to paint a picture of “What 6G may look like?.” This survey is intended to serve as an enlightening guideline to spur interests and further investigations for subsequent research and development of 6G communications systems.},

With the support of artificial intelligence, development of digital transformation through the notion of a digital twin has been taking off in many industries such as smart manufacturing, oil and gas, construction, bio-engineering, and automotive. However, digital twins remain relatively new for 5G/6G networks, despite the obvious potential in helping develop and deploy the complex 5G environment. This article looks into these topics and discusses how digital twin could be a powerful tool to fulfill the potential of 5G networks and beyond.},

In this paper, we compare the performance of two algorithms, particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and Bayesian optimisation (BO), for the autonomous determination of these hyperparameters in applications to different ML tasks typical for the field of high energy physics (HEP). Our evaluation of the performance includes a comparison of the capability of the PSO and BO algorithms to make efficient use of the highly parallel computing resources that are characteristic of contemporary HEP experiments.},

	abstract = {Adoption of digital twins in smart factories, that model real statuses of manufacturing systems through simulation with real time actualization, are manifested in the form of increased productivity, as well as reduction in costs and energy consumption. The sharp increase in changing customer demands has resulted in factories transitioning rapidly and yielding shorter product life cycles. Traditional modeling and simulation approaches are not suited to handle such scenarios. As a possible solution, we propose a generic data-driven framework for automated generation of simulation models as basis for digital twins for smart factories. The novelty of our proposed framework is in the data-driven approach that exploits advancements in machine learning and process mining techniques, as well as continuous model improvement and validation. The goal of the framework is to minimize and fully define, or even eliminate, the need for expert knowledge in the extraction of the corresponding simulation models. We illustrate our framework through a case study.},

  abstract = 	 {The unfairness of a regressor is evaluated by measuring the correlation between the estimator and the sensitive attribute (e.g., race, gender, age), and the coefficient of determination (CoD) is a natural extension of the correlation coefficient when more than one sensitive attribute exists. As is well known, there is a trade-off between fairness and accuracy of a regressor, which implies a perfectly fair optimizer does not always yield a useful prediction. Taking this into consideration, we optimize the accuracy of the estimation subject to a user-defined level of fairness. However, a fairness level as a constraint induces a nonconvexity of the feasible region, which disables the use of an off-the-shelf convex optimizer. Despite such nonconvexity, we show an exact solution is available by using tools of global optimization theory. Furthermore, we propose a nonlinear extension of the method by kernel representation. Unlike most of existing fairness-aware machine learning methods, our method allows us to deal with numeric and multiple sensitive attributes.}

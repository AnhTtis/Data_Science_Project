    "abstract": "In a series of work [Wor22],[Wor21] and [CW20], algebraic capacity was introduced in an algebraic manner for polarized surfaces and applied to the symplectic embedding problems. In this note, we give a reformulation of algebraic capacity in terms of almost complex geometry. For rational surfaces with $c_1\\cdotω> 0$, we further introduce a sequence of tropical polynomials which will describe those capacities viewed as functions over the space of such symplectic forms. As an application, we give a direct proof of the correspondence between algebraic capacity and ECH capcity for smooth toric surface without terminology from algebraic geometry.",

\section*{A.1. Results}

We extensively analyze our method on in-the-wild images across various domains such as nature, indoor settings, hypothetical scenarios, human actions, etc. All our ground-view input images are from Google Images, Flickr, and the TEDBench dataset~\cite{kawar2022imagic}. We present the results in Figures$2 - 10$. 

\section*{A.2. User study}

We quantitatively evaluate Imagic’s performance via an
extensive human perceptual evaluation study. We conduct the following types of evaluation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given a ground-view image and an aerial-view image generated using Aerial Diffusion, we ask participants to determine if the generated aerial-view image is a high fidelity (w.r.t. ground-view image) aerial-view image; and rate the image on the 5-point Likert scale. The average rating over 10 images is 3.289.   
    \item Given a ground-view image and two aerial-view images generated using Aerial Diffusion and Ablation 2 (i.e. Aerial Diffusion without the Alternating Sampling method), we ask participants to choose the better high fidelity aerial-view image. $83.05\%$ of the participants rate the image generated using Aerial Diffusion as the one with a higher quality. We also ask participants to rate (on the 5-point Likert scale) both images in terms of its `aerial viewpoint' and `fidelity w.r.t. ground-view image' individually. The average rating w.r.t. aerial viewpoint is $3.76$ and $2.98$ respectively for Aerial Diffusion and Ablation 2 (i.e. Aerial Diffusion without the Alternating Sampling method). The average rating w.r.t. fidelity is $3.275$ and $3.36$ respectively for Aerial Diffusion and Ablation 2 (i.e. Aerial Diffusion without the Alternating Sampling method). Clearly, our Alternating Sampling method is able to generate better high fidelity aerial images than linear interpolation. 
    \item Given a ground-view image and two aerial-view images generated using Aerial Diffusion and Ablation 3 (Aerial Diffusion with $e_{tgt}$ instead of $e_{src}$ while training), we ask participants to choose the better high fidelity aerial-view image. $78.125\%$ of the participants rate the image generated using Aerial Diffusion as the one with a higher quality. The average rating w.r.t. aerial viewpoint is $4.06$ and $3.325$ respectively for Aerial Diffusion and Ablation 3 (Aerial Diffusion with $e_{tgt}$ instead of $e_{src}$ while training). The average rating w.r.t. fidelity is $3.725$ and $3.375$ respectively for Aerial Diffusion and Ablation 3 (Aerial Diffusion with $e_{tgt}$ instead of $e_{src}$ while training). Clearly, our method using $e_{tgt}$ for training instead of $e_{src}$ is able to generate better high fidelity aerial images than linear interpolation.

    \caption{\textbf{State-of-the-art comparisons.} We compare with the state-of-the-art text-based image translation method, IMAGIC~\cite{kawar2022imagic} (CVPR 2023). IMAGIC is unable to generate a high-fidelity aerial view image. It merely reproduces the ground-view image, despite tuning all hyperparameters exhaustively. The hyperparameter $\eta$ (in IMAGIC~\cite{kawar2022imagic}) takes values between $0$ and $1$, and is unable to generate a high fidelity aerial image for any value of $\eta$. When $\eta$ is increased to a value higher than $1$, the model generates an aerial image but the fidelity with respect to the ground-view is completely lost. Other methods (contemporary/prior to IMAGIC~\cite{kawar2022imagic} (CVPR 2023)) such as DDIB~\cite{su2022dual} (ICLR 2023), DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2022dreambooth} (CVPR 2023), SINE~\cite{zhang2022sine} (CVPR 2023), SDEdit~\cite{meng2021sdedit}(ICLR 2022) and Text2LIVE~\cite{bar2022text2live}(ECCV 2022) face the same issues. These are due to the challenges involved in ground-to-aerial translation described in Section 1 and Section 3.1.}

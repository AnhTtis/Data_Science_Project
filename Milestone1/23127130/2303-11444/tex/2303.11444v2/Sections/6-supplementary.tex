\section*{A.1. Results}

We extensively analyze our method on in-the-wild images across various domains such as nature, indoor settings, hypothetical scenarios, human actions, etc. All our ground-view input images are from Google Images, Flickr, and the TEDBench dataset~\cite{kawar2022imagic}.

    \caption{\textbf{Results - Part 3.} Based on the text description, Aerial Diffusion can generate aerial views with scene entities slightly different from the ground-view. The hallucination of background and unseen parts of the scene can also be controlled by text.}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.48]{Figures/supp_results5.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Effect of $\alpha$.} Low values of $\alpha$ generate images that are less aerial, high values of $\alpha$ generate low-fidelity images. A trade-off between the viewpoint and fidelity generates high-fidelity aerial images. The transformation, with $\alpha$, is not smooth, reinforcing Postulate 2.}

    \caption{\textbf{Failure cases.} Our method is unable to generate high fidelity aerial views of scenes that have high complexity with multiple objects or scene entities, especially when the {\em text description} of the scene is {\em brief and inadequate}. This is a direction for future work.}

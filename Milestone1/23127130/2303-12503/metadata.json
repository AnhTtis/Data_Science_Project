    "abstract": "Phase estimation is used in many quantum algorithms, particularly in order to estimate energy eigenvalues for quantum systems. When using a single qubit as the probe (used to control the unitary we wish to estimate the eigenvalue of), it is not possible to measure the phase with a minimum mean-square error. In standard methods, there would be a logarithmic (in error) number of control qubits needed in order to achieve this minimum error. Here show how to perform this measurement using only two control qubits, thereby reducing the qubit requirements of the quantum algorithm. Our method corresponds to preparing the optimal control state one qubit at a time, while it is simultaneously consumed by the measurement procedure.",

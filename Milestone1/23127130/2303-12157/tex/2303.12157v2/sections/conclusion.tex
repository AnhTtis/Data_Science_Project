\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have proposed learning a depth covariance function, and provided selections of the depth representation, the base covariance function, and the optimization objective.  While we selected a specific nonstationary kernel function, exploration of alternatives is a valuable direction.  There is great potential to draw additional connections to the literature on Bayesian methods and GPs.  For example, geometry is low-rank and spatially local, so active selection and sparse kernels will permit scalability to higher resolutions and larger capacities.  Lastly, we demonstrated the utility of the covariance function on a selection of geometric vision tasks: depth completion, bundle adjustment, and monocular dense visual odometry.  Beyond these applications, the prior can be tightly integrated into existing geometric vision frameworks and serve as a foundation for novel formulations.

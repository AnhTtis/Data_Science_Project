    "abstract": "We present a Bayesian rating system based on the method of paired comparisons. Our system is a flexible generalization of the well-known Glicko, and in particular can better accommodate games with significant elements of luck. Our system is currently in use in the online game Duelyst II, and in that setting outperforms Glicko2.",

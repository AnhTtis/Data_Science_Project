    "abstract": "We prove a compact version of the $T1$ theorem for bi-parameter singular integrals. That is, if a bi-parameter singular integral $T$ admits compact full and partial kernel representations, and satisfies the weak compactness property, the diagonal $\\mathrm{CMO}$ condition, and the product $\\mathrm{CMO}$ condition, then $T$ can be extended to a compact operator on $L^p(w)$ for all $1<p<\\infty$ and $w \\in A_p(\\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$. Even in the unweighted setting, it is the first time to give a compact extension of Journé's $T1$ theorem on product spaces.",

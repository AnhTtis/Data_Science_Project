    "abstract": "We consider the long time evolution of a population of charged particles, under strong magnetic fields and collision mechanisms. We derive a fluid model and justify the asymptotic behavior toward smooth solutions of this regime. In three space dimensions, a constraint ocurs along the parallel direction. For eliminating the corresponding Lagrange multiplier, we average along the magnetic lines.",

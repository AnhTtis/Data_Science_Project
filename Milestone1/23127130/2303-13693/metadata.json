    "abstract": "For a singular integral equation on an interval of the real line, we study the behavior of the error of a delta-delta discretization. We show that the convergence is non-uniform, between order $O(h^{2})$ in the interior of the interval and a boundary layer where the consistency error does not tend to zero.",

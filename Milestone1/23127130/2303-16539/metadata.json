    "abstract": "In this paper the dependence of the spectra of cosmic ray nuclei on the charges of nuclei was studied, according to the data of the NUCLEON space experiment. First, we studied the dependence of the spectral index of magnetic rigidity spectra on the charge for abundant nuclei. Secondly, for the charge range $Z=9\\div20$, the differences in the total spectra of rare odd and abundant even nuclei were studied. Using the GALPROP package, the inverse problem of CR propagation from a source (near supernova) to an observer was solved, a component-by-component spectrum in the source was reconstructed, and it was shown that a systematic change in the spectral index in the source exist. It is supposed that this change may be interpreted as incomplete ionization of cosmic rays at the stage of acceleration in the supernova remnant shock. The ratio of the total spectra of magnetic rigidity for low-abundance odd and abundant even nuclei from the charge range $Z=9\\div20$ is obtained, and it was shown that the spectra of odd rare nuclei are harder than the stpectra of abundat even nuclei in the rigidity range 300--10000~GV.",

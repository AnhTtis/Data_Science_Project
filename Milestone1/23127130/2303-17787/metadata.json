    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of generating optimal vehicle flow at the macroscopic level. Although several studies have focused on optimizing vehicle flow, little attention has been given to ensuring it can be practically achieved. To overcome this issue, we propose a route-recovery and eco-driving strategy for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) that guarantees optimal flow generation. Our approach involves identifying the optimal vehicle flow that minimizes total travel time, given the constant travel demands in urban areas. We then develop a heuristic route-recovery algorithm to assign routes to CAVs that satisfy all travel demands while maintaining the optimal flow. Our method lets CAVs arrive at each road segment at their desired arrival time based on their assigned route and desired flow. In addition, we present an efficient coordination framework to minimize the energy consumption of CAVs and prevent collisions while crossing intersections. The proposed method can effectively generate optimal vehicle flow and potentially reduce travel time and energy consumption in urban areas.",

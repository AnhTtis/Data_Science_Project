    "abstract": "In this work we numerically analyze a passive photonic integrated neuromorphic accelerator based on hardware-friendly optical spectrum slicing nodes. The proposed scheme can act as a fully analogue convolutional layer, preprocessing information directly in the optical domain. The proposed scheme allows the extraction of meaningful spatio-temporal features from the incoming data, thus when used prior to a simple fully connected digital single layer network it can boost performance with negligible power consumption. Numerical simulations using the MNIST dataset confirmed the acceleration properties of the proposed scheme, where 10 neuromorphic nodes can replace the convolutional layers of a sophisticated LeNet-5 network, thus reducing the number of total floating point operations per second (FLOPS) by 98% while offering a 97.2% classification accuracy.",

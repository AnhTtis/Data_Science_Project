	abstract = {Asteroseismology involves probing the interiors of stars and quantifying their global properties, such as radius and age, through observations of normal modes of oscillation. The technical requirements for conducting asteroseismology include ultrahigh precision measured in photometry in parts per million, as well as nearly continuous time series over weeks to years, and cadences rapid enough to sample oscillations with periods as short as a few minutes. We report on results from the first 43 days of observations, in which the unique capabilities of Kepler in providing a revolutionary advance in asteroseismology are already well in evidence. The Kepler asteroseismology program holds intrinsic importance in supporting the core planetary search program through greatly enhanced knowledge of host star properties, and extends well beyond this to rich applications in stellar astrophysics.},

An important reason for this is the lack of simple frequency patterns such as those present in solar-type pulsators. This problem is further aggravated in δ Scuti stars by their particularly rich frequency spectra.},

	abstract = {We update the capabilities of the open-knowledge software instrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). RSP is a new functionality in MESAstar that models the nonlinear radial stellar pulsations that characterize RRLyrae, Cepheids, and other classes of variable stars. We signiﬁcantly enhance numerical energy conservation capabilities, including during mass changes. For example, this enables calculations through the He ﬂash that conserve energy to better than 0.001\%. To improve the modeling of rotating stars in MESA, we introduce a new approach to modifying the pressure and temperature equations of stellar structure, as well as a formulation of the projection effects of gravity darkening. A new scheme for tracking convective boundaries yields reliable values of the convective core mass and allows the natural emergence of adiabatic semiconvection regions during both core hydrogen- and helium-burning phases. We quantify the parallel performance of MESA on currentgeneration multicore architectures and demonstrate improvements in the computational efﬁciency of radiative levitation. We report updates to the equation of state and nuclear reaction physics modules. We brieﬂy discuss the current treatment of fallback in core-collapse supernova models and the thermodynamic evolution of supernova explosions. We close by discussing the new MESA Testhub software infrastructure to enhance source code development.},

	abstract = {We present the updated version of the code used to compute stellar evolutionary tracks in Padova. It is the result of a thorough revision of the major input physics, together with the inclusion of the pre-main sequence phase, not present in our previous releases of stellar models. Another innovative aspect is the possibility of promptly generating accurate opacity tables fully consistent with any selected initial chemical composition, by coupling the OPAL opacity data at high temperatures to the molecular opacities computed with our AESOPUS code (Marigo \& Aringer 2009). In this work we present extended sets of stellar evolutionary models for various initial chemical compositions, while other sets with different metallicities and/or different distributions of heavy elements are being computed. For the present release of models we adopt the solar distribution of heavy elements from the recent revision by Caffau et al. (2011), corresponding to a Sun's metallicity Z=0.0152. From all computed sets of stellar tracks, we also derive isochrones in several photometric systems. The aim is to provide the community with the basic tools to model star clusters and galaxies by means of population synthesis techniques.},

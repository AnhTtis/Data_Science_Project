    "abstract": "Neutrinoless double beta decay is the textbook example of lepton number violation, often claimed to be a probe of neutrino Majorana mass. However, it could be triggered by new physics; after all, neutrino Majorana mass requires physics beyond the Standard Model. If at least one electron were right-handed, it would automatically signify new physics rather than neutrino mass. In case both electrons were left-handed, the situation would become rather complicated, and additional effort would be needed to untangle the source for this process. We offer a comprehensive study of this issue from both the effective operator approach and the possible UV completions, including the Pati-Salam quark-lepton unification. While neutrino exchange is natural and physically preferred, our findings show that new physics can still be responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay. In particular, the Pati-Salam theory can do the job, consistently with all the phenomenological and unification constraints, as long as the unification scale lies above 10^12 GeV, albeit at the price of fine-tuning of some scalar masses.",

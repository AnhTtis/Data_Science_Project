\textcolor{black}{We propose LP-IOANet, an end-to-end, lightweight high-resolution document shadow removal solution. It consists of IOANet, a shadow removal architecture, encapsulated within a lightweight upsampler. We also propose three new datasets, which helps generalize our model to in-the-wild scenarios. Our results show that LP-IOANet comfortably outperforms the existing state-of-the-art, while running on a mobile-device in real-time in high resolution.}

    "abstract": "Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are very promising materials for quantum dots and spin-qubit implementation. Reliable operation of spin qubits requires the knowledge of Landé g-factor, which can be measured by exploiting the discrete energy spectrum on a quantum dot. However, the quantum dots realized in TMDCs has yet to reach the required quality for reliable measurement of g-factor. Quantum dot sizes reported in TMDCs so far are not small enough to observe discrete energy levels on them. Here, we report on electron transport through discrete energy levels of quantum dot in a single layer MoS2. The quantum dot energy levels are separated by few (5-6) meV such that the ground state and the excited state transitions are clearly visible. This well resolved energy separation allows us to accurately measure the ground state g-factor of ~5 in MoS2 quantum dots. We observe a spin filling sequence in our quantum dot under perpendicular magnetic field. Such a system offers an excellent testbed to measure the key parameters for evaluation and implementation of spin-valley qubits in TMDCs, thus accelerating the development of quantum systems in two dimensional semiconducting TMDCs.",

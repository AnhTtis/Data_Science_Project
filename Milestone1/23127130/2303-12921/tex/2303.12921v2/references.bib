abstract = {Foam problems are about how to best partition space into bubbles of minimal surface area. We investigate the case where one unit-volume bubble is required to tile d-dimensional space in a periodic fashion according to the standard, cubical lattice. While a cube requires surface area 2d, we construct such a bubble having surface area very close to that of a sphere; that is, proportional to √d (the minimum possible even without the constraint of being periodic). Our method for constructing this "spherical cube" is inspired by foundational questions in the theory of computation related to the concept of hardness amplification. Our methods give new algorithms for "coordinated discretization" of high-dimensional data points, which have near-optimal noise resistance. We also provide the most efficient known cubical foam in three dimensions.},

It is often claimed that differential privacy provides guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary side information. In this paper, we provide a precise formulation of these guarantees in terms of the inferences drawn by a Bayesian adversary. We show that this formulation is satisfied by both epsilon-differential privacy as well as a relaxation known as (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy. Our formulation follows the ideas originally due to Dwork and McSherry. This paper is, to our knowledge, the first place such a formulation appears explicitly. The analysis of the relaxed definition is new to this paper, and provides some guidance for setting the delta parameter when using (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={1}, journal={Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality}, author={Kasiviswanathan, Shiva P. and Smith, Adam}, year={2014}, month={Jun.} }

year = {2018},
publisher = {Curran Associates Inc.},
address = {Red Hook, NY, USA},
abstract = {Differential privacy comes equipped with multiple analytical tools for the design of private data analyses. One important tool is the so-called "privacy amplification by subsampling" principle, which ensures that a differentially private mechanism run on a random subsample of a population provides higher privacy guarantees than when run on the entire population. Several instances of this principle have been studied for different random subsampling methods, each with an ad-hoc analysis. In this paper we present a general method that recovers and improves prior analyses, yields lower bounds and derives new instances of privacy amplification by subsampling. Our method leverages a characterization of differential privacy as a divergence which emerged in the program verification community. Furthermore, it introduces new tools, including advanced joint convexity and privacy profiles, which might be of independent interest.},

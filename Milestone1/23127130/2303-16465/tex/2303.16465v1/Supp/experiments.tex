\section{More Details of Experiments}
\label{sec:supp_exp}
In this section, we give more details about the experiments, such as baseline settings in the comparison and a detailed explanation of cube point choice in the ablation study. Finally, we show more results of our method in Fig.~\ref{fig:more_results}. 

\paragraph{Baseline Settings.} 
In our experiments, we adopt VCM~\cite{merigot2010voronoi}, EC-NET~\cite{yu2018ec}, and PIE-NET~\cite{wang2020pie} as baselines to evaluate our proposed method. Specifically, we use the implementation of VCM in the CGAL library~\cite{fabri2009cgal}. Given a point cloud for testing, we compute the Voronoi covariance at each point, where the offset radius is 0.2, the convolution radius is 0.25, and the pareto-optimal threshold is 0.24. When a Voronoi covariance value is larger than the threshold, we consider the corresponding point to belong to an edge. For EC-NET and PIE-NET, we utilize the released source codes and pre-trained models to test the input point cloud with their specified normalization, and then transform the outputs to align with the ground truth for a fair evaluation.

\paragraph{Time Consumption.}
The average inference times of VCM, EC-Net, PIE-Net, and Ours are 2.06, 0.84, 0.52, and 0.15 seconds, respectively. For post-processing, our method takes 0.02s on average, which is more efficient than the post-processing of PIE-Net (3.01s). It can be explained by using masks, which can only choose surface cubes for the calculation to reduce consumption and make it more efficient than other approaches.

\paragraph{HD Results of Stress Tests.} Table~\ref{tab:Supp_stresstest_edgepoints} shows additional quantitative results of edge estimation in stress tests. Here the metric is HD instead of CD used in the main paper.

\paragraph{Ablation Study for Cube Point Choice .} We show details for the discussion of cube point choice. In Dual Contouring~\cite{ju2002dual}, the point position in the cube is calculated by minimizing a quadratic error function (QEF) on Hermite data of the surface, which are intersection points of the surface with the cube edges and their corresponding normal vectors. Let $p$ be the point position, it can be calculated by the following minimization:
\begin{align}
    p = \arg \min_x \sum_{i} (n_i \cdot (x - p_i))^2.
\end{align}
where $p_i$ is one of the intersection points with the cube edges and $n_i$ is its normal vector. The surface is approximated as a plane at each intersection point, and the formulation minimizes all the distances from $p$ to all planes in the sense of least squares. One natural counterpart for a 3D curve is to consider the intersection points with cube faces and their tangent vectors. Similarly, we approximate the curve as a line at each intersection point $p_i$ with the cube face, and minimize all distances from $p$ to all lines in the sense of least squares. Let $t_i$ be the tangent vector of $p_i$ (the direction does not need to be specified), QEF for the curve can be formulated as:
\begin{align}
    \min_{x, \forall \alpha_i} \sum_{i} \left \| x - p_i - \alpha_i t_i\right \|_2^2 + \lambda \sum_{i} \alpha_i^2.
\end{align}
where $\alpha_i$ is proposed to enable the problem to be solved by a linear system and $\lambda$ is a weight to balance the two terms. Notice that we only need to solve for $x$, and the system can be easily reformed as a linear system of order 3 to solve for $x$. However, such a type of point position definition does not perform well in the curve restoration as shown in our main paper. Therefore, we finally choose a simple and accurate definition of the point position, which adopts the midpoint of the truncated curve inside the cube. See Fig.~\ref{fig:cube_point_choice} for a visual comparison of these two definitions.

\paragraph{Performance in Higher Resolution.}
To evaluate the performance of \modelName{} in a higher resolution, we perform experiments using resolution $128^3$ and compare the results with lower resolutions, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:performance_reso128}. Using resolution $128^3$ brings more accurate PWL outputs (CD, HD), with slightly fewer scores of \RecallCube{}, \PrecisionCube{}, and \CorrectFace{}. The average inference times of Ours-$32^3$, Ours-$64^3$, and Ours-$128^3$ are 0.15, 0.21, and 0.57 seconds, respectively. On the whole, the performance of \modelName{} can scale well with the increase of voxel grid resolutions.

\paragraph{Ablation on Choice of $k$ in Point Encoder.}
We choose $k=8$ empirically based on the experiments of resolution $32^3$. For the higher resolution $64^3$, using a larger $k$ may improve the accuracy but incur much more calculation cost, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:supp_ablation_KNN}. It is a trade-off of accuracy and efficiency to apply $k=8$ in our experiments.

\input{tables/Supp_ablation_k}

\paragraph{Ablation on Using PointNet++ or 3DCNN Features.}
We conducted an ablation study with or without using PointNet++ and 3DCNN features. The results of the network predictions and the PWL curves are reported in Table~\ref{tab:supp_PN_CNN}. As shown, both the PointNet++ and 3DCNN features can promote the performance of \modelName{}.

\input{tables/Supp_PN_CNN}

\paragraph{Ablation Study on Post-processing.}
The quantitative results of parametric curves with/without post-processing are CD: 0.008/0.067, HD: 0.224/0.225. Thus, the post-processing is necessary numerically for better parametric extraction.

\paragraph{Ablation Study on data splits.}
Our experiments are all based on the same random split. Here, we test on other two different random splits with resolution $32^3$, the CD results are 0.0013 and 0.0016 (the number in our main paper is 0.0012). As shown, the differences are insignificant.

\paragraph{More Results.} More results of our method are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:more_results}. Our method can produce reasonable results even for complicated cases, as shown in the last row of Fig.~\ref{fig:more_results}.

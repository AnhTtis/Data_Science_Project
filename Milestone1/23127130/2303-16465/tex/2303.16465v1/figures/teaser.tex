	\caption{We present NerVE, a neural volumetric edge representation for parametric curve extraction from point clouds. Our method can predict structured NerVE instead of unstructured edge points in previous methods, and directly convert NerVE into piece-wise linear (PWL) curves, reducing the error-prone post-processing of previous methods into simple graph search on PWL curves. Post-processing includes (a) Endpoint detection;(b) Graph structure analysis;(c) Points thinning;(d) Special treatment for closed curves.}

	\caption{Overview of our proposed network for learning NerVE. Given a point cloud, we first utilize a simplified PointNet++~\cite{qi2017pointnet++} module and a 3D CNN module to obtain the feature grid (has the same resolution of our \modelName{} output). Three individual decoders are applied to process cube features in the grid to predict the corresponding three attributes of NerVE, i.e., edge occupancy, edge orientation, and edge point position. By converting the NerVE cubes into PWL curves, we can obtain the parametric curves of the shape with a post-processing.}

% In particular, we concatenate the cube feature with its three neighbor ones for the edge orientation learning.

	\caption{Examples of extra edges. (a) A short protruding edge will be removed if its vertex number is less than $N_p$ ($N_p=5$ in our experiments). (b) A long extra edge is also removed because of the B-Rep constraints. Such long extra edges usually appear around non-sharp edges of shapes (referring to Fig.~\ref{fig:abc_sharp_edges}), and it is difficult for neural networks to distinguish them from sharp edges.

The worldwide growth of services whereby consumers share access to cars rather than owning a car themselves could be a sustainable solution to environmental problems. However, ﬁrst research indicates that consumers' environmental concerns play a minor role for using a carsharing compared to ﬁnancial considerations. Moreover, prior research on B2C carsharing services may not be applicable to P2P services. The current research addresses this gap by investigating the role of sustainability in B2C and P2P carsharing from consumers' perspective. By applying quantitative as well as qualitative methods three studies show that consumers’ image of carsharing is “greener” than owning a car and that environmental concerns play a role when consumers decide to use P2P service over B2C services. However, interviews with carsharing users indicate that the sustainable impact of carsharing is rather perceived as a positive side effect than a main argument for carsharing. This should be considered by policy makers and marketers when promoting carsharing because of sustainable beneﬁts.},

In particular, we modify a research model by Gefen (2000) and investigate the influence of trust on the customers’ intentions: ‘Inquire about drivers’ and ‘Request a ride’. In this regard, we differentiate between ‘Trust in Uber’ and ‘Trust in drivers’, while incorporating the two antecedents: ‘Disposition to trust’ and ‘Familiarity with Uber’. The study employs survey data (n = 221) and structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). Our results provide empirical evidence that ‘Trust in Uber’ influences the customers’ intentions, whereas the influence of ‘Trust in drivers’ is insignificant.},

	abstract = {Objective: We systematically review recent empirical research on factors that influence trust in automation to present a three-layered trust model that synthesizes existing knowledge.
Background: Much of the existing research on factors that guide human-automation interaction is centered around trust, a variable that often determines the willingness of human operators to rely on automation. Studies have utilized a variety of different automated systems in diverse experimental paradigms to identify factors that impact operators’ trust.
Method: We performed a systematic review of empirical research on trust in automation from January 2002 to June 2013. Papers were deemed eligible only if they reported the results of a human-subjects experiment in which humans interacted with an automated system in order to achieve a goal. Additionally, a relationship between trust (or a trust-related behavior) and another variable had to be measured. All together, 101 total papers, containing 127 eligible studies, were included in the review.
Results: Our analysis revealed three layers of variability in human–automation trust (dispositional trust, situational trust, and learned trust), which we organize into a model. We propose design recommendations for creating trustworthy automation and identify environmental conditions that can affect the strength of the relationship between trust and reliance. Future research directions are also discussed for each layer of trust.
Conclusion: Our three-layered trust model provides a new lens for conceptualizing the variability of trust in automation. Its structure can be applied to help guide future research and develop training interventions and design procedures that encourage appropriate trust.},

	abstract = {Objective: Effects of four types of automation support and two levels of automation reliability were examined. The objective was to examine the differential impact of information and decision automation and to investigate the costs of automation unreliability. Background: Research has shown that imperfect automation can lead to differential effects of stages and levels of automation on human performance. Method: Eighteen participants performed a “sensor to shooter” targeting simulation of command and control. Dependent variables included accuracy and response time of target engagement decisions, secondary task performance, and subjective ratings of mental workload, trust, and self-confidence. Results: Compared with manual performance, reliable automation significantly reduced decision times. Unreliable automation led to greater cost in decision-making accuracy under the higher automation reliability condition for three different forms of decision automation relative to information automation. At low automation reliability, however, there was a cost in performance for both information and decision automation. Conclusion: The results are consistent with a model of human-automation interaction that requires evaluation of the different stages of information processing to which automation support can be applied. Application: If fully reliable decision automation cannot be guaranteed, designers should provide users with information automation support or other tools that allow for inspection and analysis of raw data.},

	abstract = {Trust in automation is a key determinant for the adoption of automated systems and their appropriate use. Therefore, it constitutes an essential research area for the introduction of automated vehicles to road traffic. In this study, we investigated the influence of trust promoting (Trust promoted group) and trust lowering (Trust lowered group) introductory information on reported trust, reliance behavior and takeover performance. Forty participants encountered three situations in a 17-minute highway drive in a conditionally automated vehicle (SAE Level 3). Situation 1 and Situation 3 were non-critical situations where a take-over was optional. Situation 2 represented a critical situation where a take-over was necessary to avoid a collision. A non-driving-related task (NDRT) was presented between the situations to record the allocation of visual attention. Participants reporting a higher trust level spent less time looking at the road or instrument cluster and more time looking at the NDRT. The manipulation of introductory information resulted in medium differences in reported trust and influenced participants’ reliance behavior. Participants of the Trust promoted group looked less at the road or instrument cluster and more at the NDRT. The odds of participants of the Trust promoted group to overrule the automated driving system in the non-critical situations were 3.65 times (Situation 1) to 5 times (Situation 3) higher. In Situation 2, the Trust promoted group’s mean take-over time was extended by 1154 ms and the mean minimum time-to-collision was 933 ms shorter. Six participants from the Trust promoted group compared to no participant of the Trust lowered group collided with the obstacle. The results demonstrate that the individual trust level influences how much drivers monitor the environment while performing an NDRT. Introductory information influences this trust level, reliance on an automated driving system, and if a critical take-over situation can be successfully solved.},

It is increasingly important to determine, how highly automated vehicles should drive to ensure driving comfort for the now passive drivers. Thus far, only little research has been conducted to examine this issue. In order to lay a basis on how automated vehicles should drive to ensure passenger comfort, different variations of three central maneuvers were rated and analyzed. A simulator study (N = 72) was conducted in order to identify comfortable driving strategies. Three variations of lane changes, accelerations and decelerations were conﬁgured by manipulating acceleration and jerk, and thus the course of each maneuver. Furthermore, the inﬂuence of personality traits and self-reported driving style on preferences of differently executed automated maneuvers was analyzed. Results suggest keeping acceleration and jerk as small as possible for acceleration maneuvers. For lane changes, both small accelerations as well as an early motion feedback are advisable. Interestingly, decelerating as a manual driver would is rejected compared to two artiﬁcial alternatives. Moreover, no inﬂuence of personality traits on maneuver preference was found. Only self-reported driving style had a marginal effect on participants’ preferences. In conclusion, a recommendation for an automated driving style can be given, which was perceived as comfortable by participants regardless of their personality.},

	abstract = {Trust is important for users’ acceptance and adoption of automated vehicles (AVs). Previous research has mainly focused on what information affects user trust in AVs and how the user’s trust is affected by the way the content is communicated. However, recent studies have shown that trust may also be affected by the AV’s driving style. The aim of the study was to further investigate if and how the vehicle’s driving style affects user trust in AVs and, in particular, how this is expressed by users. An experiment involving 18 participants, using a Wizard of Oz setup and within a subject design, was conducted comparing two different driving styles, ‘Defensive’ and ‘Aggressive’. Trust was measured using a mixed method research design including momentaneous trust ratings and think-aloud procedures while driving, a post-run trust questionnaire as well as trust curve sketching and a personal interview. The results show that driving style had an effect on user trust and that the ‘Defensive’ driving style was perceived as more trustworthy, in part because it was deemed more predictable than the ‘Aggressive’ driving style. Furthermore, participants expressed trust in using affective, analogical and analytic responses, the two former during the test runs and the latter directly after each test run. The interview after the completion produced a more mixed result. By combining different data collection methods, a nuanced picture of the trust formation process and users’ trust in AVs was obtained. The study concludes that it is important to consider the vehicle performance information provided by the vehicle’s driving style so as to create user trust in AVs.},

	abstract = {It is expected that autonomous vehicles capable of driving without human supervision will be released to market within the next decade. For user acceptance, such vehicles should not only be safe and reliable, they should also provide a comfortable user experience. However, individual perception of comfort may vary considerably among users. Whereas some users might prefer sporty driving with high accelerations, others might prefer a more relaxed style. Typically, a large number of parameters such as acceleration proﬁles, distances to other cars, speed during lane changes, etc., characterize a human driver’s style. Manual tuning of these parameters may be a tedious and error-prone task. Therefore, we propose a learning from demonstration approach that allows the user to simply demonstrate the desired style by driving the car manually. We model the individual style in terms of a cost function and use feature-based inverse reinforcement learning to ﬁnd the model parameters that ﬁt the observed style best. Once the model has been learned, it can be used to efﬁciently compute trajectories for the vehicle in autonomous mode. We show that our approach is capable of learning cost functions and reproducing different driving styles using data from real drivers.},

	abstract = {Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has the potential to significantly improve driver safety. Unfortunately, driver could be reluctant to ride with AVs due to the lack of trust and acceptance of AV’s driving styles. The present study investigated the impact of driver’s driving style (aggressive/defensive) and the designed driving styles of AVs (aggressive/defensive) on driver’s trust, acceptance, and take-over behavior in fully autonomous vehicles. Thirty-two participants were classified into two groups based on their driving styles using the Aggressive Driving Scale and experienced twelve scenarios in either an aggressive AV or a defensive AV. Results revealed that drivers’ trust, acceptance, and takeover frequency were significantly influenced by the interaction effects between AV’s driving style and driver’s driving style. The findings implied that driver’s individual differences should be considered in the design of AV’s driving styles to enhance driver’s trust and acceptance of AVs and reduce undesired take over behaviors.},

	abstract = {This article reports on a study to investigate how the driving behaviour of autonomous vehicles inﬂuences trust and acceptance. Two diﬀerent designs were presented to two groups of participants (n = 22/21), using actual autonomously driving vehicles. The ﬁrst was a vehicle programmed to drive similarly to a human, “peeking” when approaching road junctions as if it was looking before proceeding. The second design had a vehicle programmed to convey the impression that it was communicating with other vehicles and infrastructure and “knew” if the junction was clear so could proceed without ever stopping or slowing down. Results showed non-signiﬁcant diﬀerences in trust between the two vehicle behaviours. However, there were signiﬁcant increases in trust scores overall for both designs as the trials progressed. Post-interaction interviews indicated that there were pros and cons for both driving styles, and participants suggested which aspects of the driving styles could be improved. This paper presents user information recommendations for the design and programming of driving systems for autonomous vehicles, with the aim of improving their users’ trust and acceptance.},

We present ongoing research about adaptive customizable user profiles for autonomous driving styles.

	title = {Theoretical considerations and development of a questionnaire to measure trust in automation},
	abstract = {The increasing number of interactions with automated systems has sparked the interest of researchers in trust in automation because it predicts not only whether but also how an operator interacts with an automation. In this work, a theoretical model of trust in automation is established and the development and evaluation of a corresponding questionnaire (Trust in Automation, TiA) are described.
Building on the model of organizational trust by Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995) and the theoretical account by Lee and See (2004), a model for trust in automation containing six underlying dimensions was established. Following a deductive approach, an initial set of 57 items was generated. In a first online study, these items were analyzed and based on the criteria item difficulty, standard deviation, item-total correlation, internal consistency, overlap with other items in content, and response quote, 40 items were eliminated and two scales were merged, leaving six scales (Reliability/Competence, Understandability/Predictability, Propensity to Trust, Intention of Developers, Familiarity, and Trust in Automation) containing a total of 19 items.
The internal structure of the resulting questionnaire was analyzed in a subsequent second online study by means of an exploratory factor analysis. The results show sufficient preliminary evidence for the proposed factor structure and demonstrate that further pursuit of the model is reasonable but certain revisions may be necessary. The calculated omega coefficients indicated good to excellent reliability for all scales. The results also provide evidence for the questionnaire’s criterion validity: Consistent with the expectations, an unreliable automated driving system received lower trust ratings as a reliably functioning system. In a subsequent empirical driving simulator study, trust ratings could predict reliance on an automated driving system and monitoring in form of gaze behavior. Possible steps for revisions are discussed and recommendations for the application of the questionnaire are given.},

    "abstract": "Central exclusive diffractive production (CEDP) of proton anti-proton pairs was calculated in the Regge-eikonal approach taking into account continuum and possible $f_0(2100)$ resonance. We use the simple model with the ``scalar'' proton. Data from ISR and STAR were analysed and compared with theoretical description. Some predictions for the LHC at 13~TeV are also presented. We discuss shortly possible nuances, problems and prospects of investigations of this process at present and future hadron colliders.",

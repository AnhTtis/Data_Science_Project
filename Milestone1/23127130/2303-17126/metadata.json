    "abstract": "In \\cite{Zhu}, the authors give a general definition of Kähler angle. There are many results about Kähler angle one can try to generalize to the general case. In this paper, we focus on the symplectic critical surfaces in Hermite surfaces which is a generalization of \\cite{HL1} or \\cite{HLS1}.",

  \caption{Distributions of ${r-z}$, ${g-r}$, and ${r-W1}$ colors of optical (shaded histograms) and IR (open histograms) LRGs from above (Box A; top three panels) and along (Box B; bottom three panels) the red sequence in ${r-W1}$ versus $M_{W1}$ color--magnitude space. The regions of color--magnitude space corresponding to Box A and Box B are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cmd}. The mean, median, and skewness of each distribution, as well as the number of LRGs in each population, are given in Table~\ref{tab:data_sed}. Optical and IR LRGs from along the red sequence have similar distributions of each color, while optical LRGs above the red sequence have redder ${r-z}$ and ${g-r}$ and bluer ${r-W1}$ colors compared to IR LRGs in the same $W1$-band luminosity range.

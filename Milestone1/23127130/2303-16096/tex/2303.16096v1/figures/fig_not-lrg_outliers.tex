\caption{
The color-coded points in each panel are bright (${M_z<-23.7}$), red-sequence objects with photometric redshifts between 0.4 and 0.7 that are \emph{not} DESI LRG targets, i.e., objects with ${M_z<-23.7}$ in the first two columns of Figure~\ref{fig:lrg_frac} that cause the LRG fraction at the bright end of the red sequence to be $<1$.
The dashed and solid black lines in panels (a), (b), (d), and (e) are the various color--color and color--magnitude cuts that define the optical and IR DESI LRG target samples (Eqs.~\ref{eq:lrg_opt} and \ref{eq:lrg_ir}, respectively).
The light blue and gray contours show the distributions of \emph{all} optical and IR DESI LRG targets with photometric redshifts between 0.4 and 0.7.

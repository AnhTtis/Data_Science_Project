\caption{
Mass accretion histories and \zstarve values of four randomly selected halos from the $\zsim=0.425$ snapshot of the MDPL2 simulation. The most massive halo (purple dash-dotted line) has the earliest starvation redshift ($\zstarve=4.63$), corresponding to when its mass first reaches the characteristic value ${\mchar=10^{12}\ \msunh}$. The other three halos also reach \mchar (at later redshifts), but in accordance with Eq.~\ref{eq:zstarve} the redshift at which this occurs for each halo is not necessarily the same as its \zstarve value, e.g., the least massive halo (orange solid line) has $\zstarve=1.36$ although its mass doesn't exceed \mchar until $z\lesssim1$.

	abstract = {{We investigate the conditional colour--magnitude distribution (CCMD), namely the colour--magnitude distribution at fixed halo mass, of the central galaxies in semi-analytical galaxy formation model (SAM) and hydrodynamic simulations. We analyse the CCMD of central galaxies in each halo mass bin with the Gaussian mixture model and find that it can be decomposed into red and blue components nearly orthogonal to each other, a red component narrow in colour and extended in magnitude and a blue component narrow in magnitude and extended in colour. We focus on the SAM galaxies to explore the origin of the CCMD components by studying the relation between central galaxy colour and halo or galaxy properties. Central galaxy colour is correlated with halo assembly properties for low-mass haloes and independent of them for high-mass haloes. Galaxy properties such as central supermassive black hole mass, cold gas mass, and gas specific angular momentum can all impact central galaxy colour. These results are corroborated by an alternative machine learning analysis in which we attempt to predict central galaxy colour with halo and galaxy properties. We find that the prediction for colours of central galaxies can be significantly improved using both halo and galaxy properties as input compared to using halo properties alone. With the halo and galaxy properties considered here, we find that subtle discrepancies remain between predicted and original colour distribution for low-mass haloes and that no significant determining properties are identified in massive haloes, suggesting modulations by additional stochastic processes in galaxy formation.}},

@article{zheng_etal05,
	abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the relation between galaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. The properties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those of satellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and a semianalytic (SA) galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central and satellite galaxies to the HOD, more specifically to the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement with earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation function ⟨N⟩M for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximated by a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites and that the distribution of satellite numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo mass. Since the number of central galaxies is always zero or one, the width of P(N|M) is narrower than a Poisson distribution at low N and approaches Poisson at high N. For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass Mmin required to host a central galaxy and the mass M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite, with M1 ≈ 14Mmin (SPH) or M1 ≈ 18Mmin (SA). The stellar population age of central galaxies correlates with halo mass, and this correlation explains much of the age dependence of the galaxy HOD. The mean occupation number of young galaxies exhibits a local minimum at M ~ 10Mmin where halos are too massive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host satellites. Using the SA model, we show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halo mass cannot be described by a Schechter function because central galaxies produce a "bump" at high masses. We suggest parameterizations for the HOD and the conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxy clustering. Many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent results inferred from clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

@article{reid_etal16,
	abstract = {{The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) III project, has provided the largest survey of galaxy redshifts available to date, in terms of both the number of galaxy redshifts measured by a single survey, and the effective cosmological volume covered. Key to analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurements is understanding the detailed properties of this sample. Potential issues include variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in the targeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern of spectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for which redshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due to observational systematics. We document here the target selection algorithms used to create the galaxy samples that comprise BOSS. We also present the algorithms used to create large-scale structure catalogues for the final Data Release (DR12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify the survey mask. The algorithms are an evolution of those used by the BOSS team to construct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accurately quantify the galaxy sample. The code used, designated mksample, is released with this paper.}},

@article{dawson_etal16,
	abstract = {In a six-year program started in 2014 July, the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. These observations will be conducted simultaneously with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. In particular, eBOSS will measure with percent-level precision the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter. eBOSS will use four different tracers of the underlying matter density field to vastly expand the volume covered by BOSS and map the large-scale-structures over the relatively unconstrained redshift range 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 2.2. Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z = 0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA(z) to an accuracy of 1.2\% and measurements of H(z) to 2.1\% when combined with the z &gt; 0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ∼195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of dA(z) to an accuracy of 3.1\% and H(z) to 4.7\% at an effective redshift of z = 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 2.2, with expected precision of 2.8\% and 4.2\% on dA(z) and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 BOSS quasars, we will obtain new Lyα forest measurements at redshifts z &gt; 2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of dA(z) and H(z) at z &gt; 2.1 by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

	abstract = {The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is carrying out a five-year survey that aims to measure the redshifts of tens of millions of galaxies and quasars, including 8 million luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the redshift range 0.4 &lt; z ≲ 1.0. Here we present the selection of the DESI LRG sample and assess its spectroscopic performance using data from Survey Validation (SV) and the first two months of the Main Survey. The DESI LRG sample, selected using g, r, z, and W1 photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, is highly robust against imaging systematics. The sample has a target density of 605 deg−2 and a comoving number density of 5 × 10−4  h 3 Mpc−3 in 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8; this is a significantly higher density than previous LRG surveys (such as SDSS, BOSS, and eBOSS) while also extending to z ∼ 1. After applying a bright star veto mask developed for the sample, 98.9\% of the observed LRG targets yield confident redshifts (with a catastrophic failure rate of 0.2\% in the confident redshifts), and only 0.5\% of the LRG targets are stellar contamination. The LRG redshift efficiency varies with source brightness and effective exposure time, and we present a simple model that accurately characterizes this dependence. In the appendices, we describe the extended LRG samples observed during SV.},

	abstract = {{Upcoming surveys will use a variety of galaxy selections to map the large-scale structure of the Universe. It is important to make accurate predictions for the properties and clustering of such galaxies, including the errors on these statistics. Here, we describe a novel technique which uses the semi-analytical model of galaxy formation galform, embedded in the high-resolution N-body Planck-Millennium simulation, to populate a thousand halo catalogues generated using the Parallel-PM N-body glam code. Our hybrid scheme allows us to make clustering predictions on scales that cannot be modelled in the original N-body simulation. We focus on luminous red galaxies (LRGs) selected in the redshift range z = 0.6 − 1 from the galform output using similar colour-magnitude cuts in the r, z, and W1 bands to those that will be applied in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, and call this illustrative sample `DESI-like' LRGs. We find that the LRG-halo connection is non-trivial, leading to the prediction of a non-standard halo occupation distribution; in particular, the occupation of central galaxies does not reach unity for the most massive haloes, and drops with increasing mass. The glam catalogues reproduce the abundance and clustering of the LRGs predicted by galform. We use the glam mocks to compute the covariance matrices for the two-point correlation function and power spectrum of the LRGs and their background dark matter density field, revealing important differences. We also make predictions for the linear-growth rate and the baryon acoustic oscillations distances at z = 0.6, 0.74, and 0.93. All `DESI-like' LRG catalogues are made publicly available.}},

	abstract = {We present results from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) photometric redshift methods investigation. In this investigation, the results from 11 participants, each using a different combination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and priors, are used to examine the properties of photometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broadband multi-wavelength coverage. The photometry used includes U-band through mid-infrared filters and was derived using the TFIT method. Comparing the results, we find that there is no particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better photometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find that codes producing the lowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize photometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting, or adding extra smoothing errors. These results therefore stress the importance of the training procedure. We find a strong dependence of the photometric redshift accuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. On the other hand, we find a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift and galaxy color. We find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshift errors (e.g., 68\% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to that expected from the spectroscopic control sample. We find that all codes show a statistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. However, the bias is in all cases smaller than the scatter; the latter therefore dominates the errors. Finally, we find that combining results from multiple codes significantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction. We discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometric redshifts and error estimates.},

	abstract = {{We use photometric data from the Spitzer mission to explore the mid- and far-infrared properties of 10 red QSOs (J−K \\&gt; 2, R−K \\&gt; 5 mag) selected by combining the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) in the near-infrared with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at optical wavelengths. Optical and/or near-infrared spectra are available for 8/10 sources. Modelling the spectral energy distribution (SED) from ultraviolet to far-infrared shows that moderate dust reddening (AV= 1.3--3.2) can explain the red optical and near-IR colours of the sources in the sample. There is also evidence that red QSOs have 60/12 μm luminosity ratio higher than PG QSOs (97 per cent significance). This can be interpreted as a higher level of star formation in these systems (measured by the 60-μm luminosity) for a given active galactic nucleus (AGN) power (approximated by the 12-μm luminosity). This is consistent with a picture where red QSOs represent an early phase of AGN evolution, when the supermassive black hole is enshrouded in dust and gas clouds, which will eventually be blown out (possibly by AGN driven outflows) and the system will appear as typical optically luminous QSO. There is also tentative evidence significant at the 96 per cent level that red 2MASS QSOs are more often associated with radio emission than optically selected SDSS QSOs. This may indicate outflows, also consistent with the young AGN interpretation. We also estimate the space density of red QSOs relative to optically selected SDSS QSOs, taking into account the effect of dust extinction and the intrinsic luminosity of the sources. We estimate that the fraction of red QSOs in the overall population increases from 3 per cent at MK=−27.5 mag to 12 per cent at MK=−29.5 mag. This suggests that reddened QSOs become more important at the bright end of the luminosity function. If red QSOs are transition objects on the way to becoming typical optically luminous QSOs, the low fractions above suggest that these systems spent less than 12 per cent of their lifetime at the `reddened' stage.}},

	abstract = {{We present a new sample of purely near-infrared-selected KVega \\&lt; 16.5 [KAB \\&lt; 18.4] extremely red [(J − K)Vega \\&gt; 2.5] quasar candidates at z ∼ 2 from ≃900 deg2 of data in the UKIDSS Large Area Survey (LAS). Five of these are spectroscopically confirmed to be heavily reddened type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) with broad emission lines bringing our total sample of reddened quasars from the UKIDSS-LAS to 12 at z = 1.4--2.7. At these redshifts, Hα (6563 {\AA}) is in the K band. However, the mean Hα equivalent width of the reddened quasars is only 10 per cent larger than that of the optically selected population and cannot explain the extreme colours. Instead, dust extinction of AV ∼ 2--6 mag is required to reproduce the continuum colours of our sources. This is comparable to the dust extinctions seen in submillimetre galaxies at similar redshifts. We argue that the AGN are likely being observed in a relatively short-lived breakout phase when they are expelling gas and dust following a massive starburst, subsequently turning into UV-luminous quasars. Some of our quasars show direct evidence for strong outflows (v ∼ 800--1000 km s−1) affecting the Hα line consistent with this scenario. We predict that a larger fraction of reddened quasar hosts are likely to be submillimetre bright compared to the UV-luminous quasar population. We use our sample to place new constraints on the fraction of obscured type 1 AGN likely to be missed in optical surveys. Taken at face value our findings suggest that the obscured fraction depends on quasar luminosity. The space density of obscured quasars is approximately five times that inferred for UV-bright quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) luminosity function at Mi \\&lt; −30 but seems to drop at lower luminosities even accounting for various sources of incompleteness in our sample. We find that at Mi ∼ −28 for example, this fraction is unlikely to be larger than ∼20 per cent although these fractions are highly uncertain at present due to the small size of our sample. A deeper K-band survey for highly obscured quasars is clearly needed to test this hypothesis fully and is now becoming possible with new sensitive all-sky infrared surveys such as the VISTA Hemisphere Survey and the Wide Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All Sky Survey.}},

Optical and/or near-infrared spectroscopy provide broad wavelength sampling of their spectral energy distributions that we use to determine their reddening, characterized by E(B − V). We demonstrate that the reddening in these quasars is best described by Small-Magellanic-Cloud-like dust. This sample spans a wide range in redshift and reddening (0.1 ≲ z ≲ 3, 0.1 ≲ E(B − V) ≲ 1.5), which we use to investigate the possible correlation of luminosity with reddening. At every redshift, dust-reddened quasars are intrinsically the most luminous quasars. We interpret this result in the context of merger-driven quasar/galaxy co-evolution where these reddened quasars are revealing an emergent phase during which the heavily obscured quasar is shedding its cocoon of dust prior to becoming a ``normal'' blue quasar. When correcting for extinction, we find that, depending on how the parent population is defined, these red quasars make up ≲ 15%--20% of the luminous quasar population. We estimate, based on the fraction of objects in this phase, that its duration is 15%--20% as long as the unobscured, blue quasar phase.},

	abstract = {{A minority of the optically selected quasar population are red at optical wavelengths due to the presence of dust along the line of sight. A key focus of many red quasar studies is to understand their relationship with the overall quasar population: are they blue quasars observed at a (slight) inclination angle or do they represent a transitional phase in the evolution of quasars? Identifying fundamental differences between red and blue quasars is key to discriminate between these two paradigms. To robustly explore this, we have uniformly selected quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with mid-infrared counterparts, carefully controlling for luminosity and redshift effects. We take a novel approach to distinguish between colour-selected quasars in the redshift range of 0.2 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 2.4 by constructing redshift-sensitive g* − i* colour cuts. From cross-matching this sample to the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey, we have found a factor ≈ 3 larger fraction of radio-detected red quasars with respect to that of blue quasars. Through a visual inspection of the FIRST images and an assessment of the radio luminosities (rest-frame \\$\\{L\_\\{\\rm 1.4\\, GHz\\}\\}\\$ and \\$\\{L\_\\{\\rm 1.4\\, GHz\\}\\}/\\{L\_\\{\\rm 6\\mu m\\}\\}\\$), we find that the radio-detection excess for red quasars is primarily due to compact and radio-faint systems (around the radio-quiet -- radio-loud threshold). We show that our results rule out orientation as the origin for the differences between red and blue quasars and argue that they provide broad agreement with an evolutionary model.}},

	abstract = {QUASARS have been detected at many wavelengths, but often ones that are bright at one wavelength are very faint or undetectable at other wavelengths. It has therefore been impossible to design a single search technique that would identify all quasars, raising the question of how many may have gone unidentified. Here we show that quasars selected from a radio catalogue have a wide range of optical colours, which we interpret as arising from varying amounts of dust along the line of sight. Most of this dust probably lies within the quasar host galaxy. If the radio-quiet quasars that would normally be detected optically contain as much dust as the radio-loud ones (and have gone undetected at other wavelengths), then 80{\%} of them have been missed by optical surveys. These missing quasars could adequately account for the observed X-ray background.},

	abstract = {Adopting the framework of the halo occupation distribution (HOD), we investigate the ability of galaxy clustering measurements to simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy bias. Starting with a fiducial cosmological model and galaxy HOD, we calculate spatial clustering observables on a range of length and mass scales, dynamical clustering observables that depend on galaxy peculiar velocities, and the galaxy-matter cross-correlation measurable by weak lensing. We then change one or more cosmological parameters and use χ2 minimization to find the galaxy HOD that best reproduces the original clustering. Our parameterization of the HOD incorporates a flexible relation between galaxy occupation numbers and halo mass and allows spatial and velocity bias of galaxies within dark matter halos. Despite this flexibility, we find that changes to the HOD cannot mask substantial changes to the matter density Ωm, the matter clustering amplitude σ8, or the shape parameter Γ of the linear matter power spectrum: cosmology and bias are not degenerate. With the conservative assumption of 10\% fractional errors, the set of observables considered here can provide ~10\% (1 σ) constraints on σ8, Ωm, and Γ, using galaxy clustering data alone. The combination σ8Ω is constrained to ~5\%. In combination with traditional methods that focus on large-scale structure in the "perturbative" regime, HOD modeling can greatly amplify the cosmological power of galaxy redshift surveys by taking advantage of high-precision clustering measurements at small and intermediate scales (from sub-Mpc to ~20 h-1 Mpc). At the same time, the inferred constraints on the galaxy HOD provide valuable tests of galaxy formation theory.},

@article{berlind_etal03,
	abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the bias between galaxies and dark matter by specifying (1) the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class and (2) the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. We calculate and compare the HODs predicted by a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation of a ΛCDM cosmological model (cold dark matter with a cosmological constant) and by a semianalytic galaxy formation model applied to the same cosmology. Although the two methods predict different galaxy mass functions, their HOD predictions for samples of the same space density agree remarkably well. In a sample defined by a baryonic mass threshold, the mean occupation function ⟨N⟩M exhibits a sharp cutoff at low halo masses, a slowly rising plateau in which ⟨N⟩ climbs from 1 to 2 over nearly a decade in halo mass, and a more steeply rising high-occupancy regime at high halo mass. In the low-occupancy regime, the factorial moments ⟨N(N - 1)⟩ and ⟨N(N - 1)(N - 2)⟩ are well below the values of ⟨N⟩2 and ⟨N⟩3 expected for Poisson statistics, with important consequences for the small-scale behavior of the two- and three-point correlation functions. The HOD depends strongly on galaxy age, with high-mass halos populated mainly by old galaxies and low-mass halos by young galaxies. The distribution of galaxies within SPH halos supports the assumptions usually made in semianalytic calculations: the most massive galaxy lies close to the halo center and moves near the halo's mean velocity, while the remaining, satellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as the dark matter. The mean occupation at fixed halo mass in the SPH simulation is independent of the halo's larger scale environment, supporting both the merger tree approach of the semianalytic method and the claim that the HOD provides a complete statistical characterization of galaxy bias. We discuss the connections between the predicted HODs and the galaxy formation physics incorporated in the SPH and semianalytic approaches. These predictions offer useful guidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be tested empirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys. By applying the HODs to a large-volume N-body simulation, we show that both methods predict slight departures from a power-law galaxy correlation function, similar to features detected in recent observational analyses.},

	abstract = {We discuss how current and future data on the clustering and number density of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) can be used to constrain their relationship to dark matter haloes. We explore a three-parameter model in which the number of LBGs per dark halo scales like a power law in the halo mass: for . Here, Mmin is the minimum mass halo that can host an LBG, M1 is a normalization parameter, associated with the mass above which haloes host more than one observed LBG, and S determines the strength of the mass-dependence. We show how these three parameters are constrained by three observable properties of LBGs: the number density, the large-scale bias and the fraction of objects in close pairs. Given these three quantities, the three unknown model parameters may be estimated analytically, allowing a full exploration of parameter space. As an example, we assume a ΛCDM cosmology and consider the observed properties of a recent sample of spectroscopically confirmed LBGs. We find that the favoured range for our model parameters is , , and . The preferred region in Mmin expands by an order of magnitude, and slightly shallower slopes are acceptable if the allowed range of bg is permitted to span all recent observational estimates. We also discuss how the observed clustering of LBGs as a function of luminosity can be used to constrain halo occupation, although because of current observational uncertainties we are unable to reach any strong conclusions. Our methods and results can be used to constrain more realistic models that aim to derive the occupation function N(M) from first principles, and offer insight into how basic physical properties affect the observed properties of LBGs.},

Red galaxies, and the combined blue plus red sample, require double power-law Schechter functions to fit a dip in their LF faintwards of the characteristic magnitude M* before a steepening faint end. This upturn is at least partly due to dust-reddened disc galaxies.We measure the evolution of the galaxy LF over the redshift range 0.002 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.5 both by using a parametric fit and by measuring binned LFs in redshift slices. The characteristic luminosity L* is found to increase with redshift in all bands, with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. The comoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that of red galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud to red sequence. As well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxies also dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z≃ 0.2. At lower redshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the riz bands, and by blue galaxies in u and g.}},

We present a method for creating model-based template sets given a set of heterogeneous photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data. Our technique, nonnegative matrix factorization, is akin to principal component analysis (PCA), except that it is constrained to produce nonnegative templates, it can use a basis set of models (rather than the delta-function basis of PCA), and it naturally handles uncertainties, missing data, and heterogeneous data (including broadband fluxes at various redshifts). The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are interpretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star formation histories. We present templates fitted with this method to data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and photometry, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In addition, we present software for using such data to estimate K-corrections.},

	abstract = {{We formulate a model of the conditional colour--magnitude distribution (CCMD) to describe the distribution of galaxy luminosity and colour as a function of halo mass. It consists of two populations of different colour distributions, dubbed pseudo-blue and pseudo-red, respectively, with each further separated into central and satellite galaxies. We define a global parametrization of these four colour--magnitude distributions and their dependence on halo mass, and we infer parameter values by simultaneously fitting the space densities and autocorrelation functions of 79 galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey defined by fine bins in the colour--magnitude diagram (CMD). The model deprojects the overall galaxy CMD, revealing its tomography along the halo mass direction. The bimodality of the colour distribution is driven by central galaxies at most luminosities, though at low luminosities it is driven by the difference between blue centrals and red satellites. For central galaxies, the two pseudo-colour components are distinct and orthogonal to each other in the CCMD: at fixed halo mass, pseudo-blue galaxies have a narrow luminosity range and broad colour range, while pseudo-red galaxies have a narrow colour range and broad luminosity range. For pseudo-blue centrals, luminosity correlates tightly with halo mass, while for pseudo-red galaxies colour correlates more tightly (redder galaxies in more massive haloes). The satellite fraction is higher for redder and for fainter galaxies, with colour a stronger indicator than luminosity. We discuss the implications of the results and further applications of the CCMD model.}},

The Planck Millennium simulation uses more than 128 billion particles to resolve the matter distribution in a cube of 800 Mpc on a side, which contains more than 77 million dark matter haloes with mass greater than 2.12 × 109 h−1 M⊙ at this day. Only minor changes to a very small number of model parameters are required in the recalibration. We present predictions for the atomic hydrogen content (H i) of dark matter haloes, which is a key input into the calculation of the H i intensity mapping signal expected from the large-scale structure of the Universe. We find that the H i mass--halo mass relation displays a clear break at the halo mass above which AGN heating suppresses gas cooling, ≈3 × 1011h−1 M⊙. Below this halo mass, the H i content of haloes is dominated by the central galaxy; above this mass it is the combined H i content of satellites that prevails. We find that the H i mass--halo mass relation changes little with redshift up to \\$z\\$ = 3. The bias of H i sources shows a scale dependence that gets more pronounced with increasing redshift.}},

A correlation function fundamentally requires computing pair-wise separations between two sets of points and then computing a histogram of the separations. Corrfunc is an existing open-source, high-performance software package for efficiently computing a multitude of correlation functions. In this paper, we will discuss the SIMD AVX512F kernels within Corrfunc, capable of processing 16 floats or 8 doubles at a time. The latest manually implemented Corrfunc AVX512F kernels show a speedup of up to {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sim {\$}{\$}4{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}relative to compiler-generated code for double-precision calculations. The AVX512F kernels show {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sim {\$}{\$}1.6{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}speedup relative to the AVX kernels and compares favorably to a theoretical maximum of {\$}{\$}2{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}. In addition, by pruning pairs with too large of a minimum possible separation, we achieve a {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sim {\$}{\$}5--10{\%} speedup across all the SIMD kernels. Such speedups highlight the importance of programming explicitly with SIMD vector intrinsics for complex calculations that can not be efficiently vectorized by compilers.

We use this to build a galaxy catalogue, which has an r-band magnitude limit of r \\&lt; 20.0, with a median redshift of z ∼ 0.2. A Monte Carlo HOD method is used to assign galaxies to the halo lightcone catalogue, and we evolve the HODs to reproduce a target luminosity function; by construction, the luminosity function of galaxies in the mock is in agreement with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at low redshifts and the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey at high redshifts. A Monte Carlo method is used to assign a 0.1(g − r) colour to each galaxy, and the colour distribution of galaxies at different redshifts agrees with measurements from GAMA. The clustering of galaxies in the mock for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift bins is in good agreement with measurements from SDSS and GAMA, and the colour-dependent clustering is in reasonable agreement. We show that the baryon acoustic oscillation can be measured in the mock catalogue, and the redshift-space distortions are in agreement with measurements from SDSS illustrating that this catalogue will be useful for upcoming surveys.}},

	abstract = {{Successful halo-model descriptions of the luminosity dependence of clustering distinguish between the central galaxy in a halo and all the others (satellites). To include colours, we provide a prescription for how the colour--magnitude relation of centrals and satellites depends on halo mass. This follows from two assumptions: (i) the bimodality of the colour distribution at a fixed luminosity is independent of halo mass and (ii) the fraction of satellite galaxies which populate the red sequence increases with luminosity. We show that these two assumptions allow one to build a model of how galaxy clustering depends on colour without any additional free parameters than those required to model the luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering. We then show that the resulting model is in good agreement with the distribution and clustering of colours in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, both by comparing the predicted correlation functions of red and blue galaxies with measurements and by comparing the predicted colour--mark correlation function with the measured one. Mark correlation functions are powerful tools for identifying and quantifying correlations between galaxy properties and their environments: our results indicate that the correlation between halo mass and environment is the primary driver for correlations between galaxy colours and the environment; additional correlations associated with halo `assembly bias' are relatively small. Our approach shows explicitly how to construct mock catalogues which include both luminosities and colours -- thus providing realistic training sets for, e.g., galaxy cluster-finding algorithms. Our prescription is the first step towards incorporating the entire spectral energy distribution into the halo model approach.}},

	abstract = {The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (http://legacysurvey.org/) are a combination of three public projects (the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey, the Beijing--Arizona Sky Survey, and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey) that will jointly image ≈14,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands (g, r, and z) using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The combined survey footprint is split into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging is conducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure times and pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearly uniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys project.},

@article{wechsler_etal02,
	abstract = {We study the relation between the density profiles of dark matter halos and their mass assembly histories using a statistical sample of halos in a high-resolution N-body simulation of the ΛCDM cosmology. For each halo at z = 0, we identify its merger history tree and determine concentration parameters cvir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger tree for each halo. We fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function with one parameter, the formation epoch ac, defined when the log mass accretion rate d log M/d log a falls below a critical value S. We find that late-forming galaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that cvir "observed" at any epoch ao is strongly correlated with ac via cvir = c1ao/ac. Scatter about this relation is mostly due to measurement errors in cvir and ac, implying that the actual spread in cvir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed to scatter in ac. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to predict the mass and redshift dependence of cvir and the scatter about the median cvir(M, z) using accretion histories derived from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset between the formation times as predicted by EPS and as measured in the simulations; this new ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The correlation found between halo concentration and mass accretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall rates, the central density is related to the background density; when the mass infall rate slows, the central density stays approximately constant, and the halo concentration just grows as Rvir. Because of the direct connection between halo concentration and velocity rotation curves and because of probable connections between halo mass assembly history and star formation history, the tight correlation between these properties provides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.},

	abstract = {{We present measurements of the redshift-dependent clustering of a DESI-like luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample selected from the Legacy Survey imaging data set, and use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework to fit the clustering signal. The photometric LRG sample in this study contains 2.7 million objects over the redshift range of 0.4 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.9 over 5655 deg2. We have developed new photometric redshift (photo-z) estimates using the Legacy Survey DECam and WISE photometry, with σNMAD = 0.02 precision for LRGs. We compute the projected correlation function using new methods that maximize signal-to-noise ratio while incorporating redshift uncertainties. We present a novel algorithm for dividing irregular survey geometries into equal-area patches for jackknife resampling. For a five-parameter HOD model fit using the MultiDark halo catalogue, we find that there is little evolution in HOD parameters except at the highest redshifts. The inferred large-scale structure bias is largely consistent with constant clustering amplitude over time. In an appendix, we explore limitations of Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting using stochastic likelihood estimates resulting from applying HOD methods to N-body catalogues, and present a new technique for finding best-fitting parameters in this situation. Accompanying this paper, we have released the Photometric Redshifts for the Legacy Surveys catalogue of photo-z's obtained by applying the methods used in this work to the full Legacy Survey Data Release 8 data set. This catalogue provides accurate photometric redshifts for objects with z \\&lt; 21 over more than 16 000 deg2 of sky.}},

	abstract = {{We use principal component analysis (PCA) to estimate stellar masses, mean stellar ages, star formation histories (SFHs), dust extinctions and stellar velocity dispersions for a set of ∼290 000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than 1011 M⊙ and redshifts in the range 0.4 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.7 from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We find that the fraction of galaxies with active star formation first declines with increasing stellar mass, but then flattens above a stellar mass of 1011.5 M⊙ at z∼ 0.6. This is in striking contrast to z∼ 0.1, where the fraction of galaxies with active star formation declines monotonically with stellar mass. At stellar masses of 1012 M⊙, therefore, the evolution in the fraction of star-forming galaxies from z∼ 0.6 to the present day reaches a factor of ∼10. When we stack the spectra of the most massive, star-forming galaxies at z∼ 0.6, we find that half of their [O iii] emission is produced by active galactic nuclei. The black holes in these galaxies are accreting on average at ∼0.01 the Eddington rate. To obtain these results, we use the stellar population synthesis models of Bruzual \\&amp; Charlot to generate a library of model spectra with a broad range of SFHs, metallicities, dust extinctions and stellar velocity dispersions. The PCA is run on this library to identify its principal components over the rest-frame wavelength range 3700--5500 {\AA}. We demonstrate that linear combinations of these components can recover information equivalent to traditional spectral indices such as the 4000-{\AA} break strength and HδA, with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). In addition, the method is able to recover physical parameters such as stellar mass-to-light ratio, mean stellar age, velocity dispersion and dust extinction from the relatively low S/N BOSS spectra. We examine in detail the sensitivity of our stellar mass estimates to the input parameters in our model library, showing that almost all changes result in systematic differences in logM* of 0.1 dex or less. The biggest differences are obtained when using different population synthesis models -- stellar masses derived using Maraston et al. models are systematically smaller by up to 0.12 dex at young ages.}},

	abstract = {We model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function of DEEP2 (z ~ 1) and SDSS (z ~ 0) galaxies within the HOD framework. At both epochs, there is a tight correlation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing for larger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreases at higher luminosity. We find little evolution in the relation between mass scales of host halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the same luminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions of the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection between the galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z ~ 0 central galaxies to z ~ 1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos. We find that the stellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority of the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z ~ 0 low-mass halos (~5 × 1011 h-1 M☉) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central galaxies of high-mass halos (~1013 h-1 M☉) result from star formation between z ~ 1 and z ~ 0. In addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formation efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time. Future work that combines HOD modeling of the clustering of galaxies at different redshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter halos can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both mergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.},

The model will run on any N-body simulation whose trees are organized in a supported format and contain a minimum set of basic halo properties. In this work, we present the baryonic prescriptions implemented in sage to describe the formation and evolution of galaxies, and their calibration for three N-body simulations: Millennium, Bolshoi, and GiggleZ. Updated physics include the following: gas accretion, ejection due to feedback, and reincorporation via the galactic fountain; a new gas cooling--radio mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating cycle; AGN feedback in the quasar mode; a new treatment of gas in satellite galaxies; and galaxy mergers, disruption, and the build-up of intra-cluster stars. Throughout, we show the results of a common default parameterization on each simulation, with a focus on the local galaxy population.},

	abstract = {In a recent study, using the distribution of galaxies in the north galactic pole of the SDSS DR7 region enclosed in a 500 box, we carried out our ELUCID simulation (ELUCID III). Here, we light the dark matter halos and subhalos in the reconstructed region in the simulation with galaxies in the SDSS observations using a novel neighborhood abundance matching method. Before we make use of the galaxy--subhalo connections established in the ELUCID simulation to evaluate galaxy formation models, we set out to explore the reliability of such a link. For this purpose, we focus on the following few aspects of galaxies: (1) the central--subhalo luminosity and mass relations, (2) the satellite fraction of galaxies, (3) the conditional luminosity function (CLF) and conditional stellar mass function (CSMF) of galaxies, and (4) the cross-correlation functions between galaxies and dark matter particles, most of which are measured separately for all, red, and blue galaxy populations. We find that our neighborhood abundance matching method accurately reproduces the central--subhalo relations, satellite fraction, and the CLFs, CSMFs, and biases of galaxies. These features ensure that galaxy--subhalo connections thus established will be very useful in constraining galaxy formation processes. We provide some suggestions for the three levels of using the galaxy--subhalo pairs for galaxy formation constraints. The galaxy--subhalo links and the subhalo merger trees in the SDSS DR7 region extracted from our ELUCID simulation are available upon request.},

Illustris is a suite of large volume, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations run with the moving-mesh code Arepo and including a comprehensive set of physical models critical for following the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Each simulates a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3 and self-consistently evolves five different types of resolution elements from a starting redshift of z=127 to the present day, z=0. These components are: dark matter particles, gas cells, passive gas tracers, stars and stellar wind particles, and supermassive black holes. This data release includes the snapshots at all 136 available redshifts, halo and subhalo catalogs at each snapshot, and two distinct merger trees. Six primary realizations of the Illustris volume are released, including the flagship Illustris-1 run. These include three resolution levels with the fiducial ``full'' baryonic physics model, and a dark matter only analog for each. In addition, we provide four distinct, high time resolution, smaller volume ``subboxes''. The total data volume is ∼265 TB, including ∼800 full volume snapshots and ∼30,000 subbox snapshots. We describe the released data products as well as tools we have developed for their analysis. All data may be directly downloaded in its native HDF5 format. Additionally, we release a comprehensive, web-based API which allows programmatic access to search and data processing tasks. In both cases we provide example scripts and a getting-started guide in several languages: currently, IDL, Python, and Matlab. This paper addresses scientific issues relevant for the interpretation of the simulations, serves as a pointer to published and on-line documentation of the project, describes planned future additional data releases, and discusses technical aspects of the release.},

	abstract = {{We perform the first fit to the anisotropic clustering of Sloan Digital Sky Survey III CMASS data release 10 galaxies on scales of ∼0.8--32 h−1 Mpc. A standard halo occupation distribution model evaluated near the best-fitting Planck Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology provides a good fit to the observed anisotropic clustering, and implies a normalization for the peculiar velocity field of M ∼ 2 × 1013h−1 M⊙ haloes of fσ8(z = 0.57) = 0.450 $\pm$ 0.011. Since this constraint includes both quasi-linear and non-linear scales, it should severely constrain modified gravity models that enhance pairwise infall velocities on these scales. Though model dependent, our measurement represents a factor of 2.5 improvement in precision over the analysis of DR11 on large scales, fσ8(z = 0.57) = 0.447 $\pm$ 0.028, and is the tightest single constraint on the growth rate of cosmic structure to date. Our measurement is consistent with the Planck ΛCDM prediction of 0.480 $\pm$ 0.010 at the ∼1.9σ level. Assuming a halo mass function evaluated at the best-fitting Planck cosmology, we also find that 10 per cent of CMASS galaxies are satellites in haloes of mass M ∼ 6 × 1013h−1 M⊙. While none of our tests and model generalizations indicate systematic errors due to an insufficiently detailed model of the galaxy--halo connection, the precision of these first results warrant further investigation into the modelling uncertainties and degeneracies with cosmological parameters.}},

We compare the BOSS results with the predictions of a halo abundance matching (HAM) clustering model that assigns galaxies to dark matter haloes selected from the large BigMultiDark N-body simulation of a flat Λ cold dark matter Planck cosmology. We compare the observational data with the simulated ones on a light cone constructed from 20 subsequent outputs of the simulation. Observational effects such as incompleteness, geometry, veto masks and fibre collisions are included in the model, which reproduces within 1σ errors the observed monopole of the two-point correlation function at all relevant scales: from the smallest scales, 0.5 h−1 Mpc, up to scales beyond the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. This model also agrees remarkably well with the BOSS galaxy power spectrum (up to k ∼ 1 h Mpc−1), and the three-point correlation function. The quadrupole of the correlation function presents some tensions with observations. We discuss possible causes that can explain this disagreement, including target selection effects. Overall, the standard HAM model describes remarkably well the clustering statistics of the CMASS sample. We compare the stellar-to-halo mass relation for the CMASS sample measured using weak lensing in the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey with the prediction of our clustering model, and find a good agreement within 1σ.

To this end, we present new measurements of the redshift and stellar mass dependence of the lensing properties of the galaxy sample. We analyse to what extent models assuming the Planck18 cosmology fit to the number density and clustering can accurately predict the small-scale lensing signal. In qualitative agreement with previous BOSS studies at redshift z ∼ 0.5 and with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we find that the expected signal at small scales (\\$0.1 \\lt r\_\\{\\rm p\\}\\lt 3 \\, h^\\{-1\\}\\, \\{\\rm \\{Mpc\\}\\}\\$) is higher by \\$\\sim 25\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ than what is measured. Here, we show that this result is persistent over the redshift range 0.1 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.7 and for galaxies of different stellar masses. If interpreted as evidence for cosmological parameters different from the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) findings, our results imply \\$S\_8 = \\sigma \_8 \\sqrt\\{\\Omega \_\\{\\rm m\\}/ 0.3\\} = 0.744 \\pm 0.015\\$, whereas S8 = 0.832 $\pm$ 0.013 for Planck18. However, in addition to being in tension with CMB results, such a change in cosmology alone does not accurately predict the lensing amplitude at larger scales. Instead, other often neglected systematics like baryonic feedback or assembly bias are likely contributing to the small-scale lensing discrepancy. We show that either effect alone, though, is unlikely to completely resolve the tension. Ultimately, a combination of the two effects in combination with a moderate change in cosmological parameters might be needed.}},

All the models are built on the same high-resolution N-body simulations. We find that the HOD model generally provides the best performance in reproducing the clustering measurements in both projected and redshift spaces. The SHAM model with the same halo--galaxy relation for central and satellite galaxies (or distinct haloes and subhaloes), when including scatters, has a best-fitting χ2/dof around 2--3. We therefore extend the SHAM model to the subhalo clustering and abundance matching (SCAM) by allowing the central and satellite galaxies to have different galaxy--halo relations. We infer the corresponding halo/subhalo parameters by jointly fitting the galaxy 2PCFs and abundances and consider subhaloes selected based on three properties, the mass Macc at the time of accretion, the maximum circular velocity Vacc at the time of accretion, and the peak maximum circular velocity Vpeak over the history of the subhaloes. The three subhalo models work well for luminous galaxy samples (with luminosity above L*). For low-luminosity samples, the Vacc model stands out in reproducing the data, with the Vpeak model slightly worse, while the Macc model fails to fit the data. We discuss the implications of the modelling results.}},

The method, which follows an unbinned maximum likelihood approach, allows the deconvolution of the intrinsic CMASS colour--colour--magnitude distributions from photometric errors and selection effects. This procedure requires modelling the covariance matrix for the i-band magnitude, g − r colour and r − i colour using Stripe 82 multi-epoch data. Our results indicate that the error-deconvolved intrinsic RS distribution is consistent, within the photometric uncertainties, with a single point (\\&lt;0.05 mag) in the colour--colour plane at fixed magnitude, for a narrow redshift slice. We have computed the high-mass end (0.55Mi ≲ −22) of the 0.55i-band RS luminosity function (RS LF) in several redshift slices within the redshift range 0.52 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.63. In this narrow redshift range, the evolution of the RS LF is consistent, within the uncertainties in the modelling, with a passively evolving model with Φ* = (7.248 $\pm$ 0.204) × 10− 4 Mpc−3 mag−1, fading at a rate of 1.5 $\pm$ 0.4 mag per unit redshift. We report RS completeness as a function of magnitude and redshift in the CMASS sample, which will facilitate a variety of galaxy-evolution and clustering studies using BOSS. Our forward-modelling method lays the foundations for future studies using other dark-energy surveys like the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey or the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, which are affected by the same type of photometric blurring/selection effects.}},

We introduce a novel method which accounts for the stellar mass incompleteness of CMASS as a function of redshift, and produce CMASS mock catalogues which include selection effects, reproduce the overall SMF, the projected two-point correlation function wp, the CMASS dn/dz, and are made publicly available. We study the effects of assembly bias above collapse mass in the context of `age matching' and show that these effects are markedly different compared to the ones explored by Hearin et al. at lower stellar masses. We construct two models, one in which galaxy colour is stochastic (`AbM' model) as well as a model which contains assembly bias effects (`AgM' model). By confronting the redshift dependent clustering of CMASS with the predictions from our model, we argue that that galaxy colours are not a stochastic process in high-mass haloes. Our results suggest that the colours of galaxies in high-mass haloes are determined by other halo properties besides halo peak velocity and that assembly bias effects play an important role in determining the clustering properties of this sample.}},

We construct a spectroscopic sample containing data from the BOSS + eBOSS surveys, allowing us to recover redshift distributions from photometric data out to z ≃ 2.5.

We compare this signal with predictions from mock catalogues trained to match observables including the stellar mass function and the projected and two-dimensional clustering of CMASS. We show that the clustering of CMASS, together with standard models of the galaxy--halo connection, robustly predicts a lensing signal that is 20--40 per cent larger than observed.

We explore the impact of baryon physics, assembly bias, massive neutrinos and modifications to general relativity on ΔΣ and show that several of these effects may be non-negligible given the precision of our measurement. Disentangling cosmological effects from the details of the galaxy--halo connection, the effect of baryons, and massive neutrinos, is the next challenge facing joint lensing and clustering analyses. This is especially true in the context of large galaxy samples from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys with precise measurements but complex selection functions.}},

Matching these more extensive and more precise observational results requires us to delay the reincorporation of wind ejecta, to lower the surface density threshold for turning cold gas into stars, to eliminate ram-pressure stripping in haloes less massive than \\$\\{\\sim \\}10^\\{14\\}\\{\\rm \\, M\_\\{\\{\\odot \\}\\}\\}\\$, and to modify our model for radio mode feedback. These changes cure the most obvious failings of our previous models, namely the overly early formation of low-mass galaxies and the overly large fraction of them that are passive at late times. The new model is calibrated to reproduce the observed evolution both of the stellar mass function and of the distribution of star formation rate at each stellar mass. Massive galaxies (log M⋆/M⊙ ≥ 11.0) assemble most of their mass before z = 1 and are predominantly old and passive at z = 0, while lower mass galaxies assemble later and, for log M⋆/M⊙ ≤ 9.5, are still predominantly blue and star forming at z = 0. This phenomenological but physically based model allows the observations to be interpreted in terms of the efficiency of the various processes that control the formation and evolution of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass, gas content, environment and time.}},

	abstract = {{We describe the GALFORM semi-analytic model for calculating the formation and evolution of galaxies in hierarchical clustering cosmologies. It improves upon, and extends, the earlier scheme developed by Cole et al. The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data. We apply our methods to the ΛCDM cosmology  and find good agreement with a wide range of properties of the local galaxy population: the B- and K-band luminosity functions, the distribution of colours for the population as a whole, the ratio of ellipticals to spirals, the distribution of disc sizes, and the current cold gas content of discs. In spite of the overall success of the model, some interesting discrepancies remain: the colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters is significantly flatter than observed at bright magnitudes (although the scatter is about right), and the model predicts galaxy circular velocities, at a given luminosity, that are about 30 per cent larger than is observed. It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique. Our more detailed methods do not change our earlier conclusion that just over half the stars in the Universe are expected to have formed since }},

	abstract = {The increasing abundance of passive ``red-sequence'' galaxies since z ∼ 1--2 is mirrored by a coincident rise in the number of galaxies with spheroidal morphologies. In this paper, however, we show in detail, that, the correspondence between galaxy morphology and color is not perfect, providing insight into the physical origin of this evolution. Using the COSMOS survey, we study a significant population of red-sequence galaxies with disk-like morphologies. These passive disks typically have Sa--Sb morphological types with large bulges, but they are not confined to dense environments. They represent nearly one-half of all red-sequence galaxies and dominate at lower masses (≲1010M☉) where they are increasingly disk-dominated. As a function of time, the abundance of passive disks with M* ≲ 1011M☉ increases, but not as fast as red-sequence spheroidals in the same mass range. At higher mass, the passive disk population has declined since z ∼ 1, likely because they transform into spheroidals. Based on these trends, we estimate that as much as 60\% of galaxies transitioning onto the red sequence evolve through a passive disk phase. The origin of passive disks therefore has broad implications for our understanding of how star formation shuts down. Because passive disks tend to be more bulge-dominated than their star-forming counterparts, a simple fading of blue disks does not fully explain their origin. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of several more sophisticated explanations, including environmental effects, internal stabilization, and disk regrowth during gas-rich mergers. While previous work has sought to explain color and morphological transformations with a single process, these observations open the way to new insight by highlighting the fact that galaxy evolution may actually proceed through several separate stages.},

The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named rockstar (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 105 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations (>1010 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper has shown rockstar to have excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km s−1 at z = 0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar.},

Using observations of galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) out to z ∼ 4, the conditional SMF at z ∼ 0.1 obtained from Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy group catalogs, and the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of galaxies at z ∼ 0.1 as a function of stellar mass, we constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over the entire cosmic history from z ∼ 4 to the present. This relation is then used to predict the median assembly histories of different stellar mass components within dark matter halos (central galaxies, satellite galaxies, and halo stars). We also make predictions for the 2PCFs of high-z galaxies as function of stellar mass. Our main findings are the following: (1) Our model reasonably fits all data within the observational uncertainties, indicating that the ΛCDM concordance cosmology is consistent with a wide variety of data regarding the galaxy population across cosmic time. (2) At low-z, the stellar mass of central galaxies increases with halo mass as M0.3 and M≳ 4.0 at the massive and low-mass ends, respectively. The ratio M*, c/M reveals a maximum of ∼0.03 at a halo mass M ∼ 1011.8 h−1 M☉, much lower than the universal baryon fraction (∼0.17). At higher redshifts the maximum in M*, c/M remains close to ∼0.03, but shifts to higher halo mass. (3) The inferred timescale for the disruption of satellite galaxies is about the same as the dynamical friction timescale of their subhalos. (4) The stellar mass assembly history of central galaxies is completely decoupled from the assembly history of its host halo; the ratio M*, c/M initially increases rapidly with time until the halo mass reaches ∼1012 h−1 M☉, at which point M*, c/M ∼ 0.03. Once M ≳ 1012 h−1 M☉, there is little growth in M*, c, causing the ratio M*, c/M to decline. In Milky Way (MW)-sized halos more than half of the central stellar mass is assembled at z ≲ 0.5. (5) In low-mass halos, the accretion of satellite galaxies contributes little to the formation of their central galaxies, indicating that most of their stars must have formed in situ. In massive halos more than half of the stellar mass of the central galaxy has to be formed in situ, and the accretion of satellites can only become significant at z ≲ 2. (6) The total mass in halo stars is more than twice that of the central galaxy in massive halos, but less than 10\% of M*, c in MW-sized halos. (7) The 2PCFs of galaxies on small scales hold important information regarding the evolution of satellite galaxies, which at high-z is predicted to be much steeper than at low-z, especially for more massive galaxies. We discuss various implications of our findings regarding the formation and evolution of galaxies in a ΛCDM cosmology.},

The algorithm has multiple attractive features: (1) it can iteratively self-train the red sequence model based on a minimal spectroscopic training sample, an important feature for high-redshift surveys. (2) It can handle complex masks with varying depth. (3) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure studies. (4) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P(z). (5) Similarly, clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies, each with corresponding centering probabilities. (6) The algorithm is parallel and numerically efficient: it can run a Dark Energy Survey-like catalog in ∼500 CPU hours. (7) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance, the richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies, and the completeness and purity of the corresponding catalogs are superb. We apply the redMaPPer algorithm to ∼10, 000 deg2 of SDSS DR8 data and present the resulting catalog of ∼25,000 clusters over the redshift range z ∈ [0.08, 0.55]. The redMaPPer photometric redshifts are nearly Gaussian, with a scatter σz ≈ 0.006 at z ≈ 0.1, increasing to σz ≈ 0.02 at z ≈ 0.5 due to increased photometric noise near the survey limit. The median value for |Δz|/(1 + z) for the full sample is 0.006. The incidence of projection effects is low (⩽5\%).

	abstract = {We propose a novel method to constrain the missing fraction of galaxies using galaxy clustering measurements in the galaxy conditional stellar mass function (CSMF) framework, which is applicable to surveys that suffer significantly from sample selection effects. The clustering measurements, which are not sensitive to the random sampling (missing fraction) of galaxies, are widely used to constrain the stellar--halo mass relation (SHMR). By incorporating a missing fraction (incompleteness) component into the CSMF model (ICSMF), we use the incomplete stellar mass function and galaxy clustering to simultaneously constrain the missing fractions and the SHMRs. Tests based on mock galaxy catalogs with a few typical missing fraction models show that this method can accurately recover the missing fraction and the galaxy SHMR, hence providing us with reliable measurements of the galaxy stellar mass functions. We then apply it to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over the redshift range of 0.1 < z < 0.8 for galaxies of M* > 1011 M⊙. We find that the sample completeness for BOSS is over 80\% at z < 0.6 but decreases at higher redshifts to about 30\%. After taking these completeness factors into account, we provide accurate measurements of the stellar mass functions for galaxies with , as well as the SHMRs, over the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.8 in this largest galaxy redshift survey.},

	abstract = {{Using cosmological simulations, we address the properties of high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) across their main sequence (MS) in the plane of star formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass. We relate them to the evolution of galaxies through phases of gas compaction, depletion, possible replenishment, and eventual quenching. We find that the high-SFR galaxies in the upper envelope of the MS are compact, with high gas fractions and short depletion times (`blue nuggets'), while the lower SFR galaxies in the lower envelope have lower central gas densities, lower gas fractions, and longer depletion times, consistent with observed gradients across the MS. Stellar-structure gradients are negligible. The SFGs oscillate about the MS ridge on time-scales ∼0.4tHubble (∼1 Gyr at z ∼ 3). The propagation upwards is due to gas compaction, triggered, e.g. by mergers, counter-rotating streams, and/or violent disc instabilities. The downturn at the upper envelope is due to central gas depletion by peak star formation and outflows while inflow from the shrunken gas disc is suppressed. An upturn at the lower envelope can occur once the extended disc has been replenished by fresh gas and a new compaction can be triggered, namely as long as the replenishment time is shorter than the depletion time. The mechanisms of gas compaction, depletion, and replenishment confine the SFGs to the narrow ($\pm$0.3 dex) MS. Full quenching occurs in massive haloes (Mvir \\&gt; 1011.5 M⊙) and/or at low redshifts (z \\&lt; 3), where the replenishment time is long compared to the depletion time, explaining the observed bending down of the MS at the massive end.}},

	abstract = {{We present a framework for modelling the star-formation histories of galaxies as a stochastic process. We define this stochastic process through a power spectrum density with a functional form of a broken power law. Star-formation histories are correlated on short time-scales, the strength of this correlation described by a power-law slope, α, and they decorrelate to resemble white noise over a time-scale that is proportional to the time-scale of the break in the power spectrum density, τbreak. We use this framework to explore the properties of the stochastic process that, we assume, gives rise to the log-normal scatter about the relationship between star-formation rate and stellar mass, the so-called galaxy star-forming main sequence. Specifically, we show how the measurements of the normalization and width (σMS) of the main sequence, measured in several passbands that probe different time-scales, give a constraint on the parameters of the underlying power spectrum density. We first derive these results analytically for a simplified case where we model observations by averaging over the recent star-formation history. We then run numerical simulations to find results for more realistic observational cases. As a proof of concept, we use observational estimates of the main sequence scatter at z ∼ 0 and M⋆ ≈ 1010 M⊙ measured in H α, UV+IR, and the u-band. The result is degenerate in the τbreak-α space, but if we assume α = 2, we measure \\$\\tau \_\\{\\rm break\\}=170^\\{+169\\}\_\\{-85\\}~\\mathrm\\{Myr\\}\\$.

	abstract = {{A key uncertainty in galaxy evolution is the physics regulating star formation, ranging from small-scale processes related to the life-cycle of molecular clouds within galaxies to large-scale processes such as gas accretion on to galaxies. We study the imprint of such processes on the time-variability of star formation with an analytical approach tracking the gas mass of galaxies (`regulator model'). Specifically, we quantify the strength of the fluctuation in the star-formation rate (SFR) on different time-scales, i.e. the power spectral density (PSD) of the star-formation history, and connect it to gas inflow and the life-cycle of molecular clouds. We show that in the general case the PSD of the SFR has three breaks, corresponding to the correlation time of the inflow rate, the equilibrium time-scale of the gas reservoir of the galaxy, and the average lifetime of individual molecular clouds. On long and intermediate time-scales (relative to the dynamical time-scale of the galaxy), the PSD is typically set by the variability of the inflow rate and the interplay between outflows and gas depletion. On short time-scales, the PSD shows an additional component related to the life-cycle of molecular clouds, which can be described by a damped random walk with a power-law slope of β ≈ 2 at high frequencies with a break near the average cloud lifetime. We discuss star-formation `burstiness' in a wide range of galaxy regimes, study the evolution of galaxies about the main sequence ridgeline, and explore the applicability of our method for understanding the star-formation process on cloud-scale from galaxy-integrated measurements.}},

	abstract = {{Understanding the variability of galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) across a range of time-scales provides insight into the underlying physical processes that regulate star formation within galaxies. We compile the SFHs of galaxies at z = 0 from an extensive set of models, ranging from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (Illustris, IllustrisTNG, Mufasa, Simba, EAGLE), zoom simulations (FIRE-2, g14, and Marvel/Justice League), semi-analytic models (Santa Cruz SAM) and empirical models (UniverseMachine), and quantify the variability of these SFHs on different time-scales using the power spectral density (PSD) formalism. We find that the PSDs are well described by broken power laws, and variability on long time-scales (≳1 Gyr) accounts for most of the power in galaxy SFHs. Most hydrodynamical models show increased variability on shorter time-scales (≲300 Myr) with decreasing stellar mass. Quenching can induce ∼0.4−1 dex of additional power on time-scales \\&gt;1 Gyr. The dark matter accretion histories of galaxies have remarkably self-similar PSDs and are coherent with the in situ star formation on time-scales \\&gt;3 Gyr. There is considerable diversity among the different models in their (i) power due to star formation rate variability at a given time-scale, (ii) amount of correlation with adjacent time-scales (PSD slope), (iii) evolution of median PSDs with stellar mass, and (iv) presence and locations of breaks in the PSDs. The PSD framework is a useful space to study the SFHs of galaxies since model predictions vary widely. Observational constraints in this space will help constrain the relative strengths of the physical processes responsible for this variability.}},

	abstract = {We explore the connection between the UV luminosity functions (LFs) of high-z galaxies and the distribution of stellar masses and star formation histories (SFHs) in their host dark matter halos. We provide a baseline for a redshift-independent star formation efficiency model to which observations and models can be compared. Our model assigns a star formation rate (SFR) to each dark matter halo based on the growth rate of the halo and a redshift-independent star formation efficiency. The dark matter halo accretion rate is obtained from a high-resolution N-body simulation in order to capture the stochasticity in accretion histories and to obtain spatial information for the distribution of galaxies. The halo mass dependence of the star formation efficiency is calibrated at z = 4 by requiring a match to the observed UV LF at this redshift. The model then correctly predicts the observed UV LF at z = 5--10. We present predictions for the UV luminosity and stellar mass functions, JWST number counts, and SFHs. In particular, we find a stellar-to-halo mass relation at z = 4--10 that scales with halo mass at M

The average SFRs increase as a function of time to z = 4, although there is significant scatter around the average: about 6\% of the z = 4 galaxies show no significant mass growth. Using these SFHs, we present redshift-dependent UV-to-SFR conversion factors, mass return fractions, and mass-to-light ratios for different initial mass functions and metallicities, finding that current estimates of the cosmic SFR density at z ∼ 10 may be overestimated by ∼0.1--0.2 dex.},

We demonstrate that it is not possible to rule out galaxy assembly bias using DR7 measurements of galaxy clustering alone. Moreover, galaxy samples with Mr \\&lt; −20 and Mr \\&lt; −20.5 favour central galaxy assembly bias.

We focus on the origin of assembly bias in the mass range corresponding to the hosts of typical galaxies and use halo concentration as our chief proxy of halo formation time. We also repeat our key analyses across a broad range of halo masses and for alternative formation time definitions. We show that splashback subhaloes are responsible for two-thirds of the assembly bias signal, but do not account for the entire effect. After splashback subhaloes have been removed, we find that the remaining assembly bias signal is due to a relatively small fraction (\\$\\lesssim \\!10\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$) of haloes in dense regions. We test a number of additional physical processes thought to contribute to assembly bias and demonstrate that the two key processes are the slowing of mass growth by large-scale tidal fields and by the high velocities of ambient matter in sheets and filaments. We also rule out several other proposed physical causes of halo assembly bias. Based on our results, we argue that there are three processes that modify the assembly bias of small-mass haloes arising from the properties of the primordial Gaussian field: large-scale tidal fields, gravitational heating due to the collapse of large-scale structures, and splashback subhaloes located outside the virial radius.}},

	abstract = {{We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard Λ cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to ≲ 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 \\&lt; M*/M⊙ ≲ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully--Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C iv and O vi. While the mass--metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* ≳ 109 M⊙ (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.}},

@article{crain_etal15,
	abstract = {{We present results from 13 cosmological simulations that explore the parameter space of the `Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments' (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy
stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation -- the EAGLE reference model -- by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass ≲ M⋆ (the `knee' of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.}},

	abstract = {{Observations have revealed that the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (Mstar) of star-forming galaxies follow a tight relation known as the galaxy main sequence. However, what physical information is encoded in this relation is under debate. Here, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to study the mass dependence, evolution, and origin of scatter in the SFR--Mstar relation. At \\$z\\$ = 0, we find that the scatter decreases slightly with stellar mass from 0.35 dex at Mstar ≈ 109 M⊙ to 0.30 dex at Mstar ≳ 1010.5 M⊙. The scatter decreases from \\$z\\$ = 0 to \\$z\\$ = 5 by 0.05 dex at Mstar ≳ 1010 M⊙ and by 0.15 dex for lower masses. We show that the scatter at \\$z\\$ = 0.1 originates from a combination of fluctuations on short time-scales (ranging from 0.2--2 Gyr) that are presumably associated with self-regulation from cooling, star formation, and outflows, but is dominated by long time-scale (∼10 Gyr) variations related to differences in halo formation times. Shorter time-scale fluctuations are relatively more important for lower mass galaxies. At high masses, differences in black hole formation efficiency cause additional scatter, but also diminish the scatter caused by different halo formation times. While individual galaxies cross the main sequence multiple times during their evolution, they fluctuate around tracks associated with their halo properties, i.e. galaxies above/below the main sequence at \\$z\\$ = 0.1 tend to have been above/below the main sequence for ≫1 Gyr.}},

We build our Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework based on commonly used analytic forms for the one and two-halo terms with two free parameters:\ the minimum halo mass that hosts a central quasar and the fraction of satellite quasars that are within one halo. Inspired by recent studies that propose a steeper density profile for the dark matter haloes that host quasars, we explore HOD models at kiloparsec scales and best-fit parameters for models with 10 × higher concentration parameter.

	abstract = {We study relation between stellar mass and halo mass for high-mass halos using a sample of galaxy clusters with accurate measurements of stellar masses from optical and ifrared data and total masses from X-ray observations. We find that stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) scales as M*,BCG ∝M500αBCGwith the best fit slope of αBCG ≈0.4 $\pm$0.1. We measure scatter of M*,BCG at a fixed M500 of ≈0.2 dex. We show that stellar mass-halo mass relations from abundance matching or halo modelling reported in recent studies underestimate masses of BCGs by a factor of ∼2−4. We argue that this is because these studies used stellar mass functions (SMF) based on photometry that severely underestimates the outer surface brightness profiles of massive galaxies. We show that M*−M relation derived using abundance matching with the recent SMF calibration by Bernardi et al. (2013) based on improved photometry is in a much better agreement with the relation we derive via direct calibration for observed clusters. The total stellar mass of galaxies correlates with total mass M500 with the slope of ≈0.6 $\pm$0.1 and scatter of 0.1 dex. This indicates that efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars decreases with increasing cluster mass. The low scatter is due to large contribution of satellite galaxies:\ the stellar mass in satellite galaxies correlates with M500 with scatter of ≈0.1 dex and best fit slope of αsat ≈0.8 $\pm$0.1. We show that for a fixed choice of the initial mass function (IMF) total stellar fraction in clusters is only a factor of 3−5 lower than the peak stellar fraction reached in M ≈1012M⊙halos. The difference is only a factor of ∼1.5−3 if the IMF becomes progressively more bottom heavy with increasing mass in early type galaxies, as indicated by recent observational analyses. This means that the overall efficiency of star formation in massive halos is only moderately suppressed compared to L* galaxies and is considerably less suppressed than previously thought. The larger normalization and slope of the M*−M relation derived in this study shows that feedback and associated suppression of star formation in massive halos should be weaker than assumed in most of the current semi-analytic models and simulations.},

	abstract = {{We construct mock catalogues of galaxy groups using subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) and undertake several new tests of the SHAM prescription for the galaxy--dark matter connection. All SHAM models we studied exhibit significant tension with galaxy groups observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The SHAM prediction for the field galaxy luminosity function is systematically too dim, and the group galaxy luminosity function systematically too bright, regardless of the details of the SHAM prescription. SHAM models connecting r-band luminosity, Mr, to Vmaxacc, the maximum circular velocity of a subhalo at the time of accretion on to the host, faithfully reproduce the abundance of galaxy groups as a function of richness, g(N). However, SHAM models connecting Mr with Vmaxpeak, the peak value of Vmax over the entire merger history of the halo, overpredict the abundance of galaxy groups. Our results suggest that SHAM models for the galaxy--dark matter connection may be unable to simultaneously reproduce the observed group multiplicity function and two-point projected galaxy clustering. Nevertheless, we also report a new success of the abundance matching prescription:\ an accurate prediction for Φ(m12), the abundance of galaxy groups as a function of magnitude gap m12, defined as the difference between the r-band absolute magnitude of the two brightest group members. We demonstrate that it may be possible to use joint measurements of g(N) and Φ(m12) to provide tight constraints on the details of the SHAM implementation. Additionally, we show that the hypothesis that the luminosity gap is constructed via random draws from a universal luminosity function provides a poor description of the data, contradicting recent claims in the literature. Finally, we test a common assumption of the conditional luminosity function formalism that the satellite luminosity function Φsat(L) need only be conditioned by the brightness of the central galaxy Lcen. We find this assumption to be well supported by the observed magnitude gap distribution.}},

	abstract = {{We present the measurements and modelling of the projected and redshift-space clustering of CMASS galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 11. For a volume-limited luminous red galaxy sample in the redshift range of 0.48 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.55, we perform halo occupation distribution modelling of the small- and intermediate-scale (0.1--60 h−1 Mpc) projected and redshift-space two-point correlation functions, with an accurate model built on high-resolution N-body simulations. To interpret the measured redshift-space distortions, the distribution of galaxy velocities must differ from that of the dark matter inside haloes of ∼1013--1014 h−1 M⊙, i.e. the data require the existence of galaxy velocity bias. Most notably, central galaxies on average are not at rest with respect to the core of their host haloes, but rather move around it with a 1D velocity dispersion of \\$0.22^\\{+0.03\\}\_\\{-0.04\\}\\$ times that of the dark matter, implying a spatial offset from the centre at the level of ≲1 per cent of the halo virial radius. The luminous satellite galaxies move more slowly than the dark matter, with velocities \\$0.86^\\{+0.08\\}\_\\{-0.03\\}\\$ times those of the dark matter, which suggests that the velocity and spatial distributions of these satellites cannot both be unbiased. The constraints mainly arise from the Fingers-of-God effect at non-linear scales and the smoothing to the Kaiser effect in the translinear regime; the robustness of the results is demonstrated by a variety of tests. We discuss the implications of the existence of galaxy velocity bias for investigations of galaxy formation and cosmology.}},

	abstract = {{Non-parametric, empirically based, models for associating galaxy luminosities with halo/subhalo masses are being developed by several groups and we present here an updated version of the Vale \\&amp; Ostriker version of this model. This is based on a more accurate, self-consistent treatment of subhalo mass loss and revised results for the subhalo mass function (SHMF) to address this question anew. We find that the mass--luminosity relation, at high mass, particularly for first brightest galaxies and less so for group total, is almost independent of the actual luminosity function considered, when luminosity is scaled by the characteristic luminosity L*. Additionally, the shape of the total luminosity depends on the slope of the SHMF. For these high mass, cluster-sized haloes, we find that total luminosity scales as Ltot∼M0.88, while the luminosity of the first brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass, L1∼M0.28, in good agreement with observations and previous results. At low mass, the resulting slope of the mass--luminosity relation depends strongly of the faint end slope of the luminosity function, and we obtain a steep relation, with approximately L∼M4.5 for M∼ 1010 h−1 M⊙ in the K band. The average number of galaxies per halo/cluster is also in very good agreement with observations, scaling as ∼M0.9.In general, we obtain a good agreement with several independent sets of observational data. Taking the model as essentially correct, we consider two additional possible sources for remaining discrepancies:\ problems with the underlying cosmology and with the observational mass determination. We find that, when comparing with observations and for a flat cosmology, the model tends to prefer lower values for Ωm and σ8. Within the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) + Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) concordance plane of Tegmark et al., we find best agreement around Ωm= 0.25 and σ8= 0.8; this is also in very good agreement with the results of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)+2dF study of Sanchez et al. We also check on possible corrections for observed mass based on a comparison of the equivalent number of haloes/clusters. Additionally, we include further checks on the model results based on the mass-to-light ratio, the occupation number, the group luminosity function and the multiplicity function.}},

	abstract = {We use a statistical approach to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos in which they reside. We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation by populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good agreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions of semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and subhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation function (CF) as a function of stellar mass are in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at z = 0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong constraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can therefore predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional mass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range m $\pm$ dm/2 that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift dependence of the SHM relation and show that, for low-mass halos, the SHM ratio is lower at higher redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the stellar mass dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts that not only are massive galaxies more biased than low-mass galaxies at all redshifts, but also the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for massive galaxies than for low-mass ones. We present convenient fitting functions for the SHM relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass function, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.},

We study the dependence of the clustering strength for samples selected on (NUV -- r)abs color, specific star formation rate (SSFR), and stellar mass. We find that there is a smooth transition in the clustering of galaxies as a function of this color from weak clustering among blue galaxies to stronger clustering for red galaxies. The clustering of galaxies within the ``green valley'' has an intermediate strength, and is consistent with that expected from galaxy groups. The results are robust to the correction for dust extinction. The comparison with simple analytical modeling suggests that the halo occupation number increases with older star formation epochs.

	abstract = {We develop a theoretical framework that combines measurements of galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy clustering, and the galaxy stellar mass function in a self-consistent manner. While considerable effort has been invested in exploring each of these probes individually, attempts to combine them are still in their infancy. These combinations have the potential to elucidate the galaxy-dark matter connection and the galaxy formation physics responsible for it, as well as to constrain cosmological parameters and to test the nature of gravity. In this paper, we focus on a theoretical model that describes the galaxy-dark matter connection based on standard halo occupation distribution techniques. Several key modifications enable us to extract additional parameters that determine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and to simultaneously fit data from multiple probes while allowing for independent binning schemes for each probe. We construct mock catalogs from numerical simulations to investigate the effects of sample variance and covariance for each probe. Finally, we analyze how trends in each of the three observables impact the derived parameters of the model. In particular, we investigate various features of the observed galaxy stellar mass function (low-mass slope, ``plateau,'' knee, and high-mass cutoff) and show how each feature is related to the underlying relationship between stellar and halo mass. We demonstrate that the observed ``plateau'' feature in the stellar mass function at M

These clustering measurements provide new constraints on the connections between dark matter halo properties and galaxy properties in the context of the evolving large-scale structure of the universe. Using both an analytic model and a set of mock galaxy catalogs, we find a strong correlation between central galaxy stellar mass and dark matter halo mass over the range --, approximately consistent with previous observations and theoretical predictions. However, the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the mass scale where star formation efficiency reaches a maximum appear to evolve more strongly than predicted by other models, including models based primarily on abundance-matching constraints. We find that the fraction of satellite galaxies in halos of a given mass decreases significantly from  to , partly due to the fact that halos at fixed mass are rarer at higher redshift and have lower abundances. We also find that the  ratio, a model parameter that quantifies the critical mass above which halos host at least one satellite, decreases from  at  to  at . Considering the evolution of the subhalo mass function vis-{\`a}-vis satellite abundances, this trend has implications for relations between satellite galaxies and halo substructures and for intracluster mass, which we argue has grown due to stripped and disrupted satellites between  and .},

	abstract = {We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between central galaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the stellar mass-halo mass (SM-HM) relation, with rigorous consideration of uncertainties. Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We provide a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation for 0 < z < 1 and discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z = 0 to z = 4. The shape and the evolution are well constrained for z < 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates (0.25 dex uncertainty in normalization); however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z = 4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. We find that the integrated star formation at a given halo mass peaks at 10\%-20\% of available baryons for all redshifts from 0 to 4. This peak occurs at a halo mass of 7 × 1011 M
            ☉ at z = 0 and this mass increases by a factor of 5 to z = 4. At lower and higher masses, star formation is substantially less efficient, with stellar mass scaling as M

@article{watson_etal12,
	abstract = {We introduce a new technique that uses galaxy clustering to constrain how satellite galaxies lose stellar mass and contribute to the diffuse ``intrahalo light'' (IHL). We implement two models that relate satellite galaxy stellar mass loss to the detailed knowledge of subhalo dark matter mass loss. Model 1 assumes that the fractional stellar mass loss of a galaxy, from the time of merging into a larger halo until the final redshift, is proportional to the fractional amount of dark matter mass loss of the subhalo it lives in. Model 2 accounts for a delay in the time that stellar mass is lost due to the fact that the galaxy resides deep in the potential well of the subhalo and the subhalo may experience dark matter mass loss for some time before the galaxy is affected. We use these models to predict the stellar masses of a population of galaxies and we use abundance matching to predict the clustering of several r-band luminosity threshold samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Abundance matching assuming no stellar mass loss (akin to abundance matching at the time of subhalo infall) overestimates the correlation function on small scales (≲ 1 Mpc), while allowing too much stellar mass loss leads to an underestimate of small-scale clustering. For each luminosity threshold sample, we are thus able to constrain the amount of stellar mass loss required to match the observed clustering. We find that satellite galaxy stellar mass loss is strongly luminosity dependent, with less luminous satellite galaxies experiencing substantially more efficient stellar mass loss than luminous satellites. With constrained stellar mass loss models, we can infer the amount of stellar mass that is deposited into the IHL. We find that both of our model predictions for the mean amount of IHL as a function of halo mass are consistent with current observational measurements. However, our two models predict a different amount of scatter in the IHL from halo to halo, with Model 2 being favored by observations. This demonstrates that a comparison to IHL measurements provides independent verification of our stellar mass loss models, as well as additional constraining power.},

	abstract = {We extend the abundance matching technique (AMT) to infer the satellite-subhalo and central-halo mass relations (MRs) of local galaxies as well as the corresponding satellite conditional mass functions (CSMFs). We use as inputs the observed galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) decomposed into centrals and satellites and the ΛCDM distinct halo and subhalo mass functions. We explore the effects of defining the subhalo mass, m
            sub, at the time of (sub)halo accretion (m
            acc
            sub) versus defining it at the time of observation (m

            obs
            sub is used. We find that when the satellite-subhalo MRs are constrained by the satellite GSMF, they are always different from the central-halo MR:\ The smaller the stellar mass, the less massive the subhalo of satellites as compared to the halo of centrals of the same stellar mass. This difference is more dramatic when m

            ☉, the dark mass of satellites decreased by 60\%-65\% with respect to their masses at accretion time. We find that MRs for both definitions of subhalo mass yield CSMFs in agreement with observations. Also, when these MRs are used in a halo occupation model, the predicted two-point correlation functions at different stellar mass bins agree with observations. The average stellar-halo MR is close to the MR of central galaxies alone, and conceptually this average MR is equivalent to abundance matching the cumulative total GSMF to the halo + subhalo mass function (the standard AMT). We show that the use of m

From ξ(rp, π) we recover the real-space correlation function, ξ(r), which we find can be approximated within the errors by a power law, ξ(r) = (r/r0)-γ, on scales ~0.1-10 h-1 Mpc. In a sample with an effective redshift of zeff = 0.82, for a ΛCDM cosmology we find r0 = 3.53 $\pm$ 0.81 h-1 Mpc (comoving) and γ = 1.66 $\pm$ 0.12, while in a higher redshift sample with zeff = 1.14 we find r0 = 3.12 $\pm$ 0.72 h-1 Mpc and γ = 1.66 $\pm$ 0.12. These errors are estimated from mock galaxy catalogs and are dominated by the cosmic variance present in the current data sample. We find that red, absorption-dominated, passively evolving galaxies have a larger clustering scale length, r0, than blue, emission-line, actively star-forming galaxies. Intrinsically brighter galaxies also cluster more strongly than fainter galaxies at z ≃ 1. Our results imply that the DEEP2 galaxies have an effective bias b = 0.96 $\pm$ 0.13 if σ8DM = 1 today or b = 1.19 $\pm$ 0.16 if σ8DM = 0.8 today. This bias is lower than that predicted by semianalytic simulations at z ≃ 1, which may be the result of our R-band target selection. We discuss possible evolutionary effects within our survey volume, and we compare our results with galaxy-clustering studies at other redshifts, noting that our star-forming sample at z ≃ 1 has selection criteria very similar to the Lyman break galaxies at z ≃ 3 and that our red, absorption-line sample displays a clustering strength comparable to the expected clustering of the Lyman break galaxy descendants at z ≃ 1. Our results demonstrate that galaxy-clustering properties as a function of color, spectral type, and luminosity seen in the local universe were largely in place by z ≃ 1.},

Overdensities in galaxy number are estimated in 8 and 1 h-1 Mpc spheres centered on 115,000 galaxies taken from the SDSS spectroscopic sample. We find that, at constant color, overdensity is independent of luminosity for galaxies with the blue colors of spirals. This suggests that at fixed star formation history, spiral-galaxy mass is a very weak function of environment. Overdensity does depend on luminosity for galaxies with the red colors of early types; both low-luminosity and high-luminosity red galaxies are found to be in highly overdense regions.},

	abstract = {Empirical methods for connecting galaxies to their dark matter halos have become essential for interpreting measurements of the spatial statistics of galaxies. In this work, we present a novel approach for parameterizing the degree of concentration dependence in the abundance matching method. This new parameterization provides a smooth interpolation between two commonly used matching proxies:\ the peak halo mass and the peak halo maximal circular velocity. This parameterization controls the amount of dependence of galaxy luminosity on halo concentration at a fixed halo mass. Effectively this interpolation scheme enables abundance matching models to have adjustable assembly bias in the resulting galaxy catalogs. With the new  DarkSky Simulation, whose larger volume provides lower sample variance, we further show that low-redshift two-point clustering and satellite fraction measurements from SDSS can already provide a joint constraint on this concentration dependence and the scatter within the abundance matching framework.},

	abstract = {We study the relationship between galaxy luminosity, color, and environment in a cosmological simulation of galaxy formation. Using a simple prescription to assign colors and luminosities to simulated galaxies, we compare the predicted relationship with that observed for SDSS galaxies and find that the model successfully predicts most of the qualitative features seen in the data, but also shows some interesting differences. Specifically, the simulation predicts that the local density around bright red galaxies is a strong increasing function of luminosity, but does not depend much on color at fixed luminosity. Moreover, we show that these trends are due to central galaxies in dark matter halos whose baryonic masses correlate strongly with halo mass. The simulation also predicts that the local density around blue galaxies is a strong increasing function of color, but does not depend much on luminosity at fixed color. We show that these trends are due to satellite galaxies in halos whose stellar ages correlate with halo mass. Finally, the simulation fails to predict the luminosity dependence of environments observed around low-luminosity red galaxies. However, we show that this is most likely due to the simulation's limited resolution. A study of a higher resolution, smaller volume simulation suggests that this dependence is caused by the fact that all low-luminosity red galaxies are satellites in massive halos, whereas intermediate-luminosity red galaxies are a mixture of satellites in massive halos, and central galaxies in less massive halos.},

Comparison with these simulations shows that this simple way of estimating the bias relation and its evolution is accurate for less massive haloes as well as massive ones.

	abstract = {{We have used a combination of high resolution cosmological N-body simulations and semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation to investigate the processes that determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in cold dark matter (CDM) models and its relation to the spatial distribution of dark matter. The galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency with which galaxies form in haloes of different mass. In small mass haloes, galaxy formation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes, whereas in large mass haloes, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of the gas. As a result, the mass-to-light ratio of haloes has a deep minimum at the halo mass, ∼1012 M⊙, associated with L* galaxies, where galaxy formation is most efficient. This dependence of galaxy formation efficiency on halo mass leads to a scale-dependent bias in the distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. On large scales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to the bias in the distribution of massive haloes. On small scales, the correlation function is determined by the interplay between various effects including the spatial exclusion of dark matter haloes, the distribution function of the number of galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent, dynamical friction. Remarkably, these processes conspire to produce a correlation function in a flat, Ω0=0.3, CDM model that is close to a power law over nearly four orders of magnitude in amplitude. This model agrees well with the correlation function of galaxies measured in the automated-plate measurement survey. On small scales, the model galaxies are less strongly clustered than the dark matter, whereas on large scales they trace the occupied haloes. Our clustering predictions are robust to changes in the parameters of the galaxy formation model, provided only those models which match the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function are considered.}},

	abstract = {{We have calculated the two-point correlation functions in redshift space, ξ(σ, π), for galaxies of different spectral types in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Using these correlation functions, we are able to estimate values of the linear redshift-space distortion parameter, β≡Ω0.6m/b, the pairwise velocity dispersion, a, and the real-space correlation function, ξ(r), for galaxies with both relatively low star formation rates (for which the present rate of star formation is less than 10 per cent of its past averaged value) and galaxies with higher current star formation activity. At small separations, the real-space clustering of passive galaxies is very much stronger than that of the more actively star-forming galaxies; the correlation-function slopes are, respectively, 1.93 and 1.50, and the relative bias between the two classes is a declining function of scale. On scales larger than 10 h−1 Mpc, there is evidence that the relative bias tends to a constant, bpassive/bactive≃ 1. This result is consistent with the similar degrees of redshift-space distortions seen in the correlation functions of the two classes -- the contours of ξ(σ, π) require βactive= 0.49 $\pm$ 0.13 and βpassive= 0.48 $\pm$ 0.14. The pairwise velocity dispersion is highly correlated with β. Despite this, a significant difference is seen between the two classes. Over the range 8--20 h−1 Mpc, the pairwise velocity dispersion has mean values of 416 $\pm$ 76 and 612 $\pm$ 92 km s−1 for the active and passive galaxy samples, respectively. This is consistent with the expectation from morphological segregation, in which passively evolving galaxies preferentially inhabit the cores of high-mass virialized regions.}},

	abstract = {We measure the large-scale real-space power spectrum P(k) by using a sample of 205,443 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, covering 2417 effective square degrees with mean redshift z ≈ 0.1. We employ a matrix-based method using pseudo-Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve eigenmodes, producing uncorrelated minimum-variance measurements in 22 k-bands of both the clustering power and its anisotropy due to redshift-space distortions, with narrow and well-behaved window functions in the range 0.02 h Mpc-1 < k < 0.3 h Mpc-1. We pay particular attention to modeling, quantifying, and correcting for potential systematic errors, nonlinear redshift distortions, and the artificial red-tilt caused by luminosity-dependent bias. Our results are robust to omitting angular and radial density fluctuations and are consistent between different parts of the sky. Our final result is a measurement of the real-space matter power spectrum P(k) up to an unknown overall multiplicative bias factor. Our calculations suggest that this bias factor is independent of scale to better than a few percent for k < 0.1 h Mpc-1, thereby making our results useful for precision measurements of cosmological parameters in conjunction with data from other experiments such as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe satellite. The power spectrum is not well-characterized by a single power law but unambiguously shows curvature. As a simple characterization of the data, our measurements are well fitted by a flat scale-invariant adiabatic cosmological model with h Ωm = 0.213 $\pm$ 0.023 and σ8 = 0.89 $\pm$ 0.02 for L* galaxies, when fixing the baryon fraction Ωb/Ωm = 0.17 and the Hubble parameter h = 0.72; cosmological interpretation is given in a companion paper.},

Yet, halo clustering strength depends upon properties other than mass, such as formation time, an effect known as assembly bias. If galaxy characteristics are correlated with these auxiliary halo properties, the basic assumption of standard HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for assembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation statistics. We construct realistic mock galaxy catalogues that exhibit assembly bias as well as companion mock catalogues with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We fit HODs to the galaxy clustering in each catalogue. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs describe the true HODs well, validating the methodology. However, in all cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs exhibit significant systematic errors. We conclude that the galaxy--halo relationship inferred from galaxy clustering is subject to significant systematic errors induced by assembly bias. Efforts to model and/or constrain assembly bias should be priorities as assembly bias is a threatening source of systematic error in galaxy evolution and precision cosmology studies.}},

	abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that the quenching properties of galaxies are correlated over several megaparsecs. The large-scale `galactic conformity' phenomenon around central galaxies has been regarded as a potential signature of `galaxy assembly bias' or `pre-heating', both of which interpret conformity as a result of direct environmental effects acting on galaxy formation. Building on the iHOD halo quenching framework developed in Zu and Mandelbaum, we discover that our fiducial halo mass quenching model, without any galaxy assembly bias, can successfully explain the overall environmental dependence and the conformity of galaxy colours in Sloan Digital Sky Survey, as measured by the mark correlation functions of galaxy colours and the red galaxy fractions around isolated primaries, respectively. Our fiducial iHOD halo quenching mock also correctly predicts the differences in the spatial clustering and galaxy--galaxy lensing signals between the more versus less red galaxy subsamples, split by the red-sequence ridge line at fixed stellar mass. Meanwhile, models that tie galaxy colours fully or partially to halo assembly bias have difficulties in matching all these observables simultaneously. Therefore, we demonstrate that the observed environmental dependence of galaxy colours can be naturally explained by the combination of (1) halo quenching and (2) the variation of halo mass function with environment -- an indirect environmental effect mediated by two separate physical processes.}},

	abstract = {{In this paper we present a new, essentially empirical, model for the relation between the mass of a dark matter halo/subhalo and the luminosity of a galaxy hosted in it. To estimate this, we replace the assumption of linearity between light and mass fluctuations with the assumption of monotonicity between galaxy light and halo or subhalo mass. We are enabled to proceed with this less restrictive ansatz by the availability of new, very high-resolution dark matter simulations and more detailed and comprehensive global galactic luminosity functions.We find that the relation between halo/subhalo mass and hosted galaxy luminosity is fairly well fitted by a double power law. The relation between halo mass and group luminosity has a shallower slope for an intermediate-mass region and is fairly well fitted by a two-branch function, with both branches double power laws. Both relations asymptote to L∝M4 at low M, while at high mass the former follows L∝M0.28 and the latter L∝M0.9.In addition to the mass--luminosity relation, we also derive results for the occupation number, luminosity function of cluster galaxies, group luminosity function and multiplicity function. Then, using a prescription for the mass function of haloes in under/overdense regions and some further assumptions on the form of the mass density distribution function, we further derive results for biasing between mass and light and mass and galaxy number, the light distribution function and the void probability distribution.Our results for the most part seem to match well with observations and previous expectations. We feel this is a potentially powerful way of modelling the relation between halo mass and galaxy luminosity, because the main inputs are readily testable against dark matter simulation results and galaxy surveys, and the outputs are free from the uncertainties of physically modelling galaxy formation.}},

We map the distribution of associated dark matter, using new Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer integral field spectroscopy of a gravitationally lensed system threaded through the cluster core.

Such offsets are not seen in field galaxies, but are predicted during the long infall to a cluster, if dark matter self-interactions generate an extra drag force. With such a small physical separation, it is difficult to definitively rule out astrophysical effects operating exclusively in dense cluster core environments -- but if interpreted solely as evidence for self-interacting dark matter, this offset implies a cross-section σDM/m ∼ (1.7 $\pm$ 0.7) × 10−4 cm2 g−1 × (tinfall/109 yr)−2, where tinfall is the infall duration.}},

Using recently re-calibrated DEEP2 SFRs from restframe B-band magnitude and optical colors, we find that within the blue galaxy population at z ∼ 1 the clustering amplitude increases strongly with increasing SFR and decreasing sSFR. For red galaxies there is no significant correlation between clustering amplitude and either SFR or sSFR. Blue galaxies with high SFR or low sSFR are as clustered on large scales as red galaxies. We find that the clustering trend observed with SFR can be explained mostly, but not entirely, by the correlation between stellar mass and clustering amplitude for blue galaxies. We also show that galaxies above the star-forming ``main sequence'' are less clustered than galaxies below the main sequence, at a given stellar mass. These results are not consistent with the high-sSFR population being dominated by major mergers. We also measure the clustering amplitude on small scales (⩽0.3 h
            --1 Mpc) and find an enhanced clustering signal relative to the best-fit large-scale power law for red galaxies with high stellar mass, blue galaxies with high SFR, and both red and blue galaxies with high sSFR. The increased small-scale clustering for galaxies with high sSFRs is likely linked to triggered star formation in interacting galaxies. These measurements provide strong constraints on galaxy evolution and halo occupation distribution models at z ∼ 1.},

We find that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement.
The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the effect of metallicity with a fixed passband, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are briefly discussed.},

This evolutionary constraint provides a simple way to probe z > 8 galaxy populations without direct observations. Tests of the method with galaxy properties at z = 4 successfully reproduce the known evolution of the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation, galaxy SSFRs, and the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR) for 5  4. We show that this result is closely linked to the flattening in galaxy SSFRs at z > 2 compared to halo SMARs; we expect that average galaxy SSFRs at fixed stellar mass will continue their mild evolution to z ? 15. The expected CSFR shows no breaks or features at z > 8.5; this constrains both reionization and the possibility of a steep falloff in the CSFR at z = 9-10. Finally, we make predictions for stellar mass and luminosity functions for the James Webb Space Telescope, which should be able to observe one galaxy with M* ? 10^8 Msun per 10^3 Mpc^3 at z = 9.6 and one such galaxy per 10^4 Mpc^3 at z = 15.},

	abstract = {Previous work has demonstrated that at a given stellar mass, quiescent galaxies are more strongly clustered than star-forming galaxies. The contribution to this signal from central, as opposed to satellite, galaxies is not known, which has strong implications for galaxy evolution models. To investigate the contribution from central galaxies, here we present measurements of the clustering of isolated primary (IP) galaxies, used as a proxy for central galaxies, at 0.2 < z < 0.9 with data from the PRIsm MUlti-Object Survey (PRIMUS) galaxy redshift survey. Using a sample of spectroscopic redshifts for ∼60,000 galaxies with  covering 5 deg2 on the sky, we define IP galaxies using isolation cuts in spatial proximity and stellar mass of nearby galaxies. We find that at a fixed stellar mass, quiescent IP galaxies are more strongly clustered than star-forming IP galaxies at z ∼ 0.35 (10σ). Using mock galaxy catalogs based on the recent halo occupation models of Behroozi et al. and designed to replicate the parameters of the PRIMUS survey data set, we find that these clustering differences are due in part to quiescent central galaxies being more strongly clustered than star-forming central galaxies. This is consistent with either distinct stellar-to-halo mass relations for quiescent and star-forming central galaxies, and/or central galaxy assembly bias. We additionally use mock catalogs to assess the dependence of both incompleteness and satellite galaxy contamination in the IP galaxy samples on redshift, galaxy type, and stellar mass, and demonstrate how isolation criteria yield biased subsamples of central galaxies via environmental incompleteness, or the preferential exclusion of central galaxies in overdense environments.},

	abstract = {We present the first stable release of Halotools (v0.2), a community-driven Python package designed to build and test models of the galaxy-halo connection. Halotools provides a modular platform for creating mock universes of galaxies starting from a catalog of dark matter halos obtained from a cosmological simulation. The package supports many of the common forms used to describe galaxy-halo models:\ the halo occupation distribution, the conditional luminosity function, abundance matching, and alternatives to these models that include effects such as environmental quenching or variable galaxy assembly bias. Satellite galaxies can be modeled to live in subhalos or to follow custom number density profiles within their halos, including spatial and/or velocity bias with respect to the dark matter profile. The package has an optimized toolkit to make mock observations on a synthetic galaxy population---including galaxy clustering, galaxy--galaxy lensing, galaxy group identification, RSD multipoles, void statistics, pairwise velocities and others---allowing direct comparison to observations. Halotools is object-oriented, enabling complex models to be built from a set of simple, interchangeable components, including those of your own creation. Halotools has an automated testing suite and is exhaustively documented on  http://halotools.readthedocs.io, which includes quickstart guides, source code notes and a large collection of tutorials. The documentation is effectively an online textbook on how to build and study empirical models of galaxy formation with Python.},

	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for generating merger trees and halo catalogs which explicitly ensures consistency of halo properties (mass, position, and velocity) across time steps. Our algorithm has demonstrated the ability to improve both the completeness (through detecting and inserting otherwise missing halos) and purity (through detecting and removing spurious objects) of both merger trees and halo catalogs. In addition, our method is able to robustly measure the self-consistency of halo finders; it is the first to directly measure the uncertainties in halo positions, halo velocities, and the halo mass function for a given halo finder based on consistency between snapshots in cosmological simulations. We use this algorithm to generate merger trees for two large simulations (Bolshoi and Consuelo) and evaluate two halo finders (ROCKSTAR and BDM). We find that both the ROCKSTAR and BDM halo finders track halos extremely well; in both, the number of halos which do not have physically consistent progenitors is at the 1\%-2\% level across all halo masses. Our code is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/consistent-trees. Our trees and catalogs are publicly available at http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi/.},

The data set contains 8370 galaxies with confirmed redshifts in the range $0.7\leqz\leq1.4$, over 1 deg$^2$ on the sky. Groups are identified using an algorithm (the Voronoi-Delaunay method) that has been shown to accurately reproduce the statistics of groups in simulated DEEP2-like samples. We optimize this algorithm for the DEEP2 survey by applying it to realistic mock galaxy catalogs and assessing the results using a stringent set of criteria for measuring group-finding success, which we develop and describe in detail here. We find in particular that the group finder can successfully identify ~78\% of real groups and that ~79\% of the galaxies that are true members of groups can be identified as such. Conversely, we estimate that ~55\% of the groups we find can be definitively identified with real groups and that ~46\% of the galaxies we place into groups are interloper field galaxies. Most importantly, we find that it is possible to measure the distribution of groups in redshift and velocity dispersion, $n(\sigma,z)$, to an accuracy limited by cosmic variance, for dispersions greater than 350 km s$^{-1}$. We anticipate that such measurements will allow strong constraints to be placed on the equation of state of the dark energy in the future. Finally, we present the first DEEP2 group catalog, which assigns 32\% of the galaxies to 899 distinct groups with two or more members, 153 of which have velocity dispersions above 350 km s$^{-1}$. We provide locations, redshifts and properties for this high-dispersion subsample. This catalog represents the largest sample to date of spectroscopically detected groups at $z\sim1$.},

	annote = {We identify galaxy groups and clusters in volume-limited samples of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift survey, using a redshift-space friends-of-friends algorithm. We optimize the friends-of-friends linking lengths to recover galaxy systems that occupy the same dark matter halos, using a set of mock catalogs created by populating halos of N-body simulations with galaxies. Extensive tests with these mock catalogs show that no combination of perpendicular and line-of-sight linking lengths is able to yield groups and clusters that simultaneously recover the true halo multiplicity function, projected size distribution, and velocity dispersion. We adopt a linking length combination that yields, for galaxy groups with 10 or more members:\ a group multiplicity function that is unbiased with respect to the true halo multiplicity function; an unbiased median relation between the multiplicities of groups and their associated halos; a spurious group fraction of less than ~1\%; a halo completeness of more than ~97\%; the correct projected size distribution as a function of multiplicity; and a velocity dispersion distribution that is ~20\% too low at all multiplicities. These results hold over a range of mock catalogs that use different input recipes of populating halos with galaxies. We apply our group-finding algorithm to the SDSS data and obtain three group and cluster catalogs for three volume-limited samples that cover 3495.1 deg2 on the sky, go out to redshifts of 0.1, 0.068, and 0.045, and contain 57,138, 37,820, and 18,895 galaxies, respectively. We correct for incompleteness caused by fiber collisions and survey edges and obtain measurements of the group multiplicity function, with errors calculated from realistic mock catalogs. These multiplicity function measurements provide a key constraint on the relation between galaxy populations and dark matter halos.},

	abstract = {We use a modified version of the halo-based group finder developed by Yang et al. to select galaxy groups from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR4). In the first step, a combination of two methods is used to identify the centers of potential groups and to estimate their characteristic luminosity. Using an iterative approach, the adaptive group finder then uses the average mass-to-light ratios of groups, obtained from the previous iteration, to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is then used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership in redshift space. Finally, each individual group is assigned two different halo masses:\ one based on its characteristic luminosity and the other based on its characteristic stellar mass. Applying the group finder to the SDSS DR4, we obtain 301,237 groups in a broad dynamic range, including systems of isolated galaxies. We use detailed mock galaxy catalogs constructed for the SDSS DR4 to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members, contamination by interlopers, and accuracy of the assigned masses. This paper is the first in a series and focuses on the selection procedure, tests of the reliability of the group finder, and the basic properties of the group catalog (e.g., the mass-to-light ratios, the halo mass-to-stellar mass ratios). The group catalogs including the membership of the groups are available on request.},

	abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here, we define this galaxy--halo connection as the multivariate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This galaxy--halo connection provides a key test of physical galaxy-formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy--halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy-formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 1012M?, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

@article{zu_etal17,
	abstract = {{Recently, several studies have discovered a strong discrepancy between the large-scale clustering biases of two subsamples of galaxy clusters at the same halo mass, split by their average projected membership distances ?Rmem?. The level of this discrepancy significantly exceeds the maximum halo assembly bias predicted by ? cold dark matter (?CDM). We explore whether some of the large-scale bias differences could be caused by projection effects in ?Rmem? due to other systems along the line of sight. We thoroughly investigate the assembly bias of the redMaPPer clusters in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), by defining a new variant of the average membership distance estimator \\$\\tilde\\{R\\}\_\\{\\mathrm\\{mem\\}\\}\\$ that is robust against projection effects in the cluster membership identification. Using the angular mark correlation functions, we show that the large-scale bias differences when splitting by ?Rmem? can be mostly attributed to projection effects. After splitting by \\$\\tilde\\{R\\}\_\\{\\mathrm\\{mem\\}\\}\\$, the anomalously large signal is reduced, giving a ratio of 1.02 $\pm$ 0.14 between the two clustering biases as measured from weak lensing. Using a realistic mock cluster catalogue, we predict that the bias ratio between two \\$\\tilde\\{R\\}\_\\{\\mathrm\\{mem\\}\\}\\$-split subsamples should be ?1.10, which is \\&gt;60?per?cent weaker than the maximum halo assembly bias (1.24) when split by halo concentration. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the level of halo assembly bias exhibited by clusters in SDSS is consistent with the ?CDM prediction. With a 10-fold increase in cluster numbers, deeper ongoing surveys will enable a more robust detection of halo assembly bias. Our findings also have important implications for quantifying the impact of projection effects on cosmological constraints using photometrically selected clusters.}},

	abstract = {We analyze the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and two-point correlation function of galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat ?CDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the "subhalos," distinct gravitationally bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the HOD, the probability distribution for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N , is similar to that found in semianalytic and N -body+gasdynamics studies. Its first moment, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} N ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} M , has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power-law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} N ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 4. We show that the HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number N s of satellite galaxies. The former can be approximated by a steplike function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment. The first moment of the satellite HOD can be well described by a simple power law ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} N s ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} M ? with ? ? 1 for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z = 0, the two-point correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fitted by a power law down to ~100 h -1 kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. The dependence of correlation amplitude on the number density of objects is in general agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At redshifts z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales, where the CF steepens because of a more pronounced one-halo component. The departures from the power law may thus be easier to detect in high-redshift galaxy surveys than at the present-day epoch. They can be used to put useful constraints on the environments and formation of galaxies. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is dangerous and is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation function w (?) in the COSMOS field. Independent determinations of w (?) as a function of magnitude limit are presented for both the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ACS catalog and also the ground-based data from Subaru and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Despite having significantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. At bright magnitudes ( I AB < 22), our data generally match very well with existing measurements and with mock catalogs based on the semianalytic galaxy formation calculations of Kitzbichler & White (2007 ) from the Millennium Simulation. The exception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmic variance scatter for ? > 10', which we attribute to a particularly rich structure known to exist at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 0.8. For fainter samples, however, the level of clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies; in all three catalogs we find w (? = 1') ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 0.014 at a median I AB magnitude of 24. At these very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latest determinations from the Canada-France Legacy Survey. This level of clustering is approximately double what is predicted by the semianalytic catalogs (at all angles). The semianalytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, which is too small to account for the discrepancy. We therefore conclude that the mean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.},

	abstract = {We use the current sample of ~10,000 zCOSMOS spectra of sources selected with I AB < 22.5 to define the density field out to z ~ 1, with much greater resolution in the radial dimension than has been possible with either photometric redshifts or weak lensing. We present the new algorithm that we have developed (ZADE) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically by modifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using the spectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. We present a number of tests on mock catalogs used to justify this approach. The ZADE algorithm allows us to probe a broader range of galaxy environments and reduce the Poisson noise in the density field. The reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zCOSMOS galaxies consists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending up to z ~ 1. Some of these structures are very large, spanning the ~50 h --1 Mpc transverse direction of the COSMOS field and extending up to ? z ~ 0.05 in redshift. We present the three-dimensional overdensity maps and compare the reconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialized groups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in X-rays. The distribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by these virialized structures. A comparison of the large-scale structures in the zCOSMOS data and in the mock catalogs reveals an excellent agreement between the fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a given overdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2 < z < 1, although in the data these overdense regions are in generally larger contiguous structures.},

	abstract = {We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic sample to constrain the projected radial distribution of satellites around isolated ~ L * galaxies. We employ mock galaxy catalogs derived from high-resolution cosmological simulations to investigate the effects of interloper contamination and show that interlopers significantly bias the estimated slope of the projected radial distribution of satellites. We also show that the distribution of interlopers around galaxies is expected to be nonuniform in velocity space because galaxies are clustered and reside in crowded environments. Successful methods of interloper contamination correction should therefore take into account environments of the host galaxies. Two such new methods are presented, and the most reliable of them is used to correct for interloper contamination in analyses of the SDSS galaxy sample. The best-fit power-law slope of the interloper-corrected surface density distribution of satellites, ?( R ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} R ? , in the volume-limited SDSS sample is ? ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} -1.7 $\pm$ 0.1, independent of the galaxy and satellite luminosities. Comparison with ?CDM simulations shows that the radial distribution of the SDSS satellites is more concentrated than that of subhalos around galaxy-sized halos, especially at R < 100 h -1 kpc. The predicted dark matter radial distribution is somewhat more concentrated than the profile of the SDSS satellites, but the difference is not statistically significant for our sample.},

	abstract = {We present a new proxy for the overdensity peak height for which the large-scale clustering of haloes of a given mass does not vary significantly with the assembly history. The peak height, usually taken to be well represented by the virial mass, can instead be approximated by the mass inside spheres of different radii, which in some cases can be larger than the virial radius and therefore include mass outside the individual host halo. The sphere radii are defined as ? where ?t is the age relative to the typical age of galaxies hosted by haloes with virial mass Mvir, Mnl is the non-linear mass, and a= 0.2 and b=-0.02 are the free parameters adjusted to trace the assembly bias effect. Note that r depends on both halo mass and age. In this new approach, some of the objects which were initially considered low-mass peaks (i.e. which had low virial masses) belong to regions with higher overdensities. At large scales, i.e. in the two-halo regime, this model properly recovers the simple prescription where the bias responds to the height of the mass peak alone, in contrast to the usual definition (virial mass) that shows a strong dependence on additional halo properties such as formation time. The dependence on the age in the one-halo term is also remarkably reduced with the new definition. The population of galaxies whose `peak height' changes with this new definition consists mainly of old stellar populations and are preferentially hosted by low-mass haloes located near more massive objects. The latter is in agreement with recent results which indicate that old, low-mass haloes would suffer truncation of mass accretion by nearby larger haloes or simply due to the high density of their surroundings, thus showing an assembly bias effect. The change in mass is small enough that the Sheth et al. mass function is still a good fit to the resulting distribution of new masses.},

	abstract = {We study an assembly-type bias parametrized by the dimensionless spin parameter that affects massive structures. In numerical simulations, higher spin haloes are more strongly clustered than lower spin haloes of equal mass. We detect a difference of over 30 per cent in the clustering strength for dark matter haloes of (10^13)/h to (10^14)/h M?, which is similar to the result of Bett et al. We explore whether the dependence of clustering strength on halo spin is removed if we apply the redefinition of overdensity peak height proposed by Lacerna & Padilla (Paper I) obtained using assembly ages. We find that this is not the case due to two reasons. First, only a few objects of low virial mass are moved into the mass range where the spin introduces an assembly-type bias after using this redefinition. Secondly, this formalism does not alter the mass of massive objects. In other words, the sample of haloes with redefined mass M in the high-mass regime is practically the same as before the redefinition of peak height, and thus the clustering behaviour is the same. We then repeat the process of finding the redefined peak height of Paper I but using the spin. In this case, the new masses show no spin-related assembly bias but they introduce a previously absent assembly bias with respect to relative age. From this result, we conclude that the assembly-type bias with respect to the halo spin has a different origin from that with respect to the assembly age. The former may be due to the material from filaments, which is accreted by massive haloes, and enhanced in high-density environments, thus causing more extreme spin values without significantly changing the formation age of the halo. In addition, the estimates of the mass of collapsed structures in numerical simulations could be lower than the true mass, even in cluster-size haloes. High-mass objects may correspond, in some cases, to a different peak height from that suggested by their virial mass, providing a possible explanation for the assembly-type bias with respect to the spin.},

	abstract = {We analyse galaxies in groups in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and find a weak but significant assembly-type bias, where old central galaxies have a higher clustering amplitude (61 $\pm$ 9 per cent) at scales >1/h Mpc than young central galaxies of equal host halo mass (Mh~(10^11.8)/h M?). The observational sample is volume limited out to z = 0.1 with Mr - 5 log (h) ? -19.6. We construct a mock catalogue of galaxies that shows a similar signal of assembly bias (46 $\pm$ 9 per cent) at the same halo mass. We then adapt the model presented by Lacerna & Padilla (Paper I) to redefine the overdensity peak height, which traces the assembly bias such that galaxies in equal density peaks show the same clustering regardless of their stellar age, but this time using observational features such as a flux limit. The proxy for peak height, which is proposed as a better alternative than the virial mass, consists in the total mass given by the mass of neighbour host haloes in cylinders centred at each central galaxy. The radius of the cylinder is parameterized as a function of stellar age and virial mass. The best-fitting sets of parameters that make the assembly bias signal lower than 5-15 per cent for both SDSS and mock central galaxies are similar. The idea behind the parameterization is not to minimize the bias, but it is to use this method to understand the physical features that produce the assembly bias effect. Even though the tracers of the density field used here differ significantly from those used in Paper I, our analysis of the simulated catalogue indicates that the different tracers produce correlated proxies, and therefore the reason behind assembly bias is the crowding of peaks in both simulations and the SDSS.},

	abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat $Lambda$CDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at z < 2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range (10^11)/h Msun < M < (10^15)/h Msun to <5\%, improving on previous results by a factor of 2--3. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 and earlier epochs. Earlier studies have sought to calibrate a universal mass function, in the sense that the same functional form and parameters can be used for different cosmologies and redshifts when expressed in appropriate variables. In addition to our fitting formulae, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal function at this level or accuracy. The amplitude of the ``universal" function decreases monotonically by $\sim$20--50\%, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

Using analytic arguments and N-body simulations, we calculate the mass function and clustering of dark matter halos across a range of redshifts and levels of non-Gaussianity. We propose a simple fitting function for the mass function valid across the entire range of our simulations. We find pronounced effects of non-Gaussianity on the clustering of dark matter halos, leading to strongly scale-dependent bias. This suggests that the large-scale clustering of rare objects may provide a sensitive probe of primordial non-Gaussianity. We very roughly estimate that upcoming surveys can constrain non-Gaussianity at the level of |fNL|?10, which is competitive with forecasted constraints from the microwave background.},

@article{zentner07,
	abstract = {I review the excursion set theory with particular attention toward applications to cold dark matter halo formation and growth, halo abundance, and halo clustering. After a brief introduction to notation and conventions, I begin by recounting the heuristic argument leading to the mass function of bound objects given by Press and Schechter. I then review the more formal derivation of the Press-Schechter halo mass function that makes use of excursion sets of the density field. The excursion set formalism is powerful and can be applied to numerous other problems. I review the excursion set formalism for describing both halo clustering and bias and the properties of void regions. As one of the most enduring legacies of the excursion set approach and one of its most common applications, I spend considerable time reviewing the excursion set theory of halo growth. This section of the review culminates with the description of two Monte Carlo methods for generating ensembles of halo mass accretion histories. In the last section, I emphasize that the standard excursion set approach is the result of several simplifying assumptions. Dropping these assumptions can lead to more faithful predictions and open excursion set theory to new applications. One such assumption is that the height of the barriers that define collapsed objects is a constant function of scale. I illustrate the implementation of the excursion set approach for barriers of arbitrary shape. One such application is the now well-known improvement of the excursion set mass function derived from the "moving" barrier for ellipsoidal collapse. I also emphasize that the statement that halo accretion histories are independent of halo environment in the excursion set approach is not a general prediction of the theory. It is a simplifying assumption. I review the method for constructing correlated random walks of the density field in the more general case. I construct a simple toy model to illustrate that excursion set theory (with a constant barrier height) makes a simple and general prediction for the relation between halo accretion histories and the large-scale environments of halos:\ regions of high density preferentially contain late-forming halos and conversely for regions of low density. I conclude with a brief discussion of the importance of this prediction relative to recent numerical studies of the environmental dependence of halo properties.},

We extend earlier work based on the same simulation by superposing results for redshifts from 0 to 3, by defining a less noisy estimator of clustering amplitude, and by considering halo concentration, substructure mass fraction and spin, as well as formation time, as additional parameters. These improvements lead to results with less noise than previous studies and covering a wider range of halo masses and structural properties. We find significant and significantly different assembly bias effects for all the halo properties we consider, although in all cases the dependencies on halo mass and on redshift are adequately described as a dependence on equivalent peak height ?(M, z). The ?-dependencies for different halo properties differ qualitatively and are not related as might naively be expected given the relations between formation time, concentration, substructure fraction and spin found for the halo population as a whole. These results suggest that it will be difficult to build models for the galaxy populations of dark haloes which can robustly relate the amplitude of large-scale galaxy clustering to that for mass clustering at better than the 10 per cent level.},

	abstract = {The clustering of dark haloes depends not only on their mass but also on their assembly history, a dependence we term `assembly bias'. Using a galaxy formation model grafted on to the Millennium Simulation of the ?CDM cosmogony, we study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original simulation to `shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly swapped among haloes of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations between assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are ignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark matter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more realistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances two-point correlations by 10 per cent for galaxies with brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar amount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour, assembly bias is 5 per cent stronger for red galaxies and 5 per cent weaker for blue ones. Halo central galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of all types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central galaxies. Shuffling galaxies among haloes of fixed formation redshift or concentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much smaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation of environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of these parameters. It induces effects which could compromise precision measurements of cosmological parameters from large galaxy surveys.},

	abstract = {We investigate the dependence of dark matter halo clustering on halo formation time, density profile concentration, and subhalo occupation number, using high-resolution numerical simulations of a ?CDM cosmology. We confirm results that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time at fixed mass and that this trend depends on halo mass. For the first time, we show unequivocally that halo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that the dependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately parameterized in a simple way:\ b(M,c|z) = b(M|z)b(c|M/M?). Interestingly, the scaling between bias and concentration changes sign with the value of M/M?:\ high-concentration (early forming) objects cluster more strongly for M ? M?, while low-concentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-mass halos, M ? M?. We show the first explicit demonstration that host dark halo clustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) at fixed mass and discuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectra and galaxy clustering statistics. The effect of these halo properties on clustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are significantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our results suggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g., low surface brightness dwarfs) should have more slowly rising rotation curves than their more clustered counterparts and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies in voids. They also imply that self-calibrating richness-selected cluster samples with their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and bias cosmological parameter estimation.},

The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, img1.gif(Lpeak, z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so img1.gif(Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the "break" in the observed luminosity function. From img1.gif(Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background.

	abstract = {NEARBY clusters of galaxies are filled with red elliptical 'E' and lenticular 'SO' galaxies1, while younger clusters (at redshifts of >~ 0.4) contain substantial populations of blue spiral galaxies with morphological peculiarities. Thus, within the last 4-5 billion years, galaxies in clusters underwent strong evolution that completely changed their character. By contrast, galaxies that are not associated with clusters show far less morphological evolution8. Here we propose that multiple highspeed encounters between galaxies---`galaxy harassment'---drives the morphological evolution in clusters. Our simulations show that these encounters are very different from mergers; they transform small disk galaxies into dwarf elliptical or dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Harassment will leave detectable debris arcs and could provide fuel for quasars in sub-luminous host galaxies.},

	abstract = {We study the thermal formation history of four simulated galaxies that were shown by Naab et al. to reproduce a number of observed properties of elliptical galaxies. The temperature of the gas in the galaxies is steadily increasing with decreasing redshift, although much of the gas has a cooling time shorter than the Hubble time. The gas is being heated and kept hot by gravitational heating processes through the release of potential energy from infalling stellar clumps. The energy is dissipated in supersonic collisions of infalling gas lumps with the ambient gas and through the dynamical capturing of satellite systems causing gravitational wakes that transfer energy to the surrounding gas. Furthermore, dynamical friction from the infalling clumps pushes out dark matter (DM), lowering the central DM density by up to a factor of 2 from z = 3 to z = 0. In galaxies in which the late formation history ( z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 2) is dominated by minor merging and accretion, the energy released ( E ~ 5 ? 10 59 erg) from gravitational feedback is sufficient to form red and dead elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1 even in the absence of supernova and AGN feedback.},

	abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bimodality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass ~3 ? 1010Msolar. Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z~ 1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L*, and massive starbursts at z~ 2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass Mshock<~ 1012Msolar, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a `fundamental line'. Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M>=Mshock haloes preferentially at z>= 2 lead to massive starbursts in L > L* galaxies. At z < 2, in M > Mshock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as active galactic nuclei. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to `red-and-dead' massive spheroids starting at z~ 1. A minimum in feedback efficiency near Mshock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star formation history. The cold flows provide a hint for solving the angular momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bimodality features and solve other open puzzles.},

	abstract = {A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

	abstract = {Satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low star formation rates (SFRs) and lie on the `red sequence' than central (`field') galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, together with a high-resolution, cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star formation histories and quenching time-scales of satellites of Mstar > 5 ? 109 M? at z ? 0. We first explore satellite infall histories:\ group preprocessing and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z ? 0.5, or ?5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for building up all quiescent galaxies at Mstar < 1010 M?. We then constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a `delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario:\ satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of <0.8 Gyr. These quenching time-scales are shorter for more massive satellites but do not depend on host halo mass:\ the observed increase in the satellite quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

	abstract = {We analyze the clustering of red and blue galaxies from four samples spanning a redshift range of 0.4 < z < 2.0 to test the various scenarios by which galaxies evolve onto the red sequence. The data are taken from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey, DEEP2, and COMBO-17. The use of clustering allows us to determine what fraction of the red sequence is made up of central galaxies and satellite galaxies. At all redshifts, including z = 0, the data are consistent with ~60\% of satellite galaxies being red or quenched, implying that ~1/3 of the red sequence is comprised of satellite galaxies. More than three-fourths of red satellite galaxies were moved to the red sequence after they were accreted onto a larger halo. The constant fraction of satellite galaxies that are red yields a quenching time for satellite galaxies that depends on redshift in the same way as halo dynamical times:\ t Q ~ (1 + z ) --1.5 . In three of the four samples, the data favor a model in which red central galaxies are a random sample of all central galaxies; there is no preferred halo mass scale at which galaxies make the transition from star-forming to red and dead. The large errors on the fourth sample inhibit any conclusions. Theoretical models in which star formation is quenched above a critical halo mass are excluded by these data. A scenario in which mergers create red central galaxies imparts a weaker correlation between halo mass and central galaxy color, but even the merger scenario creates tension with red galaxy clustering at redshifts above 0.5. These results suggest that the mechanism by which central galaxies become red evolves from z = 0.5 to z = 0.},

	abstract = {We use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study how structure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and on stellar mass. Local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixed absolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 Mpc in projected radius and +/-500 km s-1 in depth. The stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by almost a factor of two towards higher masses between low- and high-density regions. At fixed stellar mass both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly on local density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration are almost independent of it. Only for low-mass galaxies (M* < 3 ? 10^10 Msolar, where M*= stellar mass) do we find a weak shift towards greater concentration and compactness in the highest-density regions. The galaxy property most sensitive to environment is specific star formation rate (SFR). For galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10^10 to 3 ? 10^10 Msolar, the median SFR/M* decreases by more than a factor of 10 as the population shifts from predominantly star-forming at low densities to predominantly inactive at high densities. This decrease is less marked, but still significant, for high-mass galaxies. Galaxy properties that are associated with star formation correlate strongly with local density. At fixed stellar mass twice as many galaxies host active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong [OIII] emission in low-density regions as in high. Massive galaxies in low-density environments also contain more dust. To gain insight into the processes that shut down star formation, we analyse correlations between spectroscopic indicators that probe the star formation history (SFH) on different time-scales:\ the ?4000 break strength, the Balmer-absorption index H?A, and the specific SFR/M*. The correlations between these indicators do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease in star formation activity in dense environments occurs over long (>1-Gyr) time-scales. Since structure does not depend on environment for galaxies with masses greater than 3 ? 10^10 Msolar, the trends in recent SFH, dust and nuclear activity in these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure, for example mergers or harassment. The SFH-density correlation is strongest for small-scale estimates of local density. We see no evidence that star formation history depends on environment more than 1 Mpc from a galaxy. Finally, we highlight a striking similarity between the changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as a function of redshift. We use mock catalogues derived from N-body simulations to explain how this may be understood.},

We characterize the environment by:\ (1) ?5, the surface number density of galaxies determined by the projected distance to the fifth nearest neighbour; and (2) ?1.1 and ?5.5, three-dimensional density estimates obtained by convolving the galaxy distribution with Gaussian kernels of dispersion 1.1 and 5.5 Mpc, respectively. We find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies form two distinct populations, as characterized by their H? equivalent width, W0(H?). The relative numbers of star-forming and quiescent galaxies vary strongly and continuously with local density. However, the distribution of W0(H?) amongst the star-forming population is independent of environment. The fraction of star-forming galaxies shows strong sensitivity to the density on large scales, ?5.5, which is likely independent of the trend with local density, ?1.1. We use two differently selected group catalogues to demonstrate that the correlation with galaxy density is approximately independent of group velocity dispersion, for ?= 200-1000 km s-1. Even in the lowest-density environments, no more than ~70 per cent of galaxies show significant H? emission. Based on these results, we conclude that the present-day correlation between star formation rate and environment is a result of short-time-scale mechanisms that take place preferentially at high redshift, such as starbursts induced by galaxy-galaxy interactions.},

The color distribution is well fitted with two Gaussian distributions, which we use to divide the sample into a blue and red population. At fixed luminosity, the mean color of the blue (red) distribution is nearly independent of environment, with a weakly significant (~3 ?) detection of a trend for colors to become redder by 0.1-0.14 (0.03-0.06) mag with a factor of ~100 increase in local density, as characterized by the surface density of galaxies within a $\pm$1000 km s -1 redshift slice. In contrast, at fixed luminosity the fraction of galaxies in the red distribution is a strong function of local density, increasing from ~10\%-30\% of the population in the lowest density environments to ~70\% at the highest densities. The strength of this trend is similar for both the brightest (-23 < M r < -22) and faintest (-19 < M r < -18) galaxies in our sample. The fraction of red galaxies within the virialized regions of clusters shows no significant dependence on velocity dispersion. Even at the lowest densities explored, a substantial population of red galaxies exists, which might be fossil groups. We propose that most star-forming galaxies today evolve at a rate that is determined primarily by their intrinsic properties and independent of their environment. Any environmentally triggered transformations from blue to red colors must occur either on a short timescale or preferentially at high redshift to preserve the simple Gaussian nature of the color distribution. The mechanism must be effective for both bright and faint galaxies.},

We trace the bimodality of the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting double Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute magnitude bins. Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for red and blue distributions (early- and late-type, predominantly field, galaxies) without using any cut in morphology. Instead, the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well fitted by a straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations can be described by a shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04, -0.05) plus a steeper transition in the average galaxy properties over about 2 mag. The midpoints of the transitions (Mr = -19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions, respectively) occur around 2 ? 1010 Script M? after converting luminosities to stellar mass. Separate luminosity functions are obtained for the two distributions. The red distribution has a more luminous characteristic magnitude and a shallower faint-end slope (M* = -21.5, ? = -0.8) compared to the blue distribution (? ? -1.3, depending on the parameterization). These are approximately converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses greater than about 3 ? 1010 Script M?. Using a simple merger model, we show that the differences between the two functions are consistent with the red distribution being formed from major galaxy mergers.},

It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-{\AA} break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index H?A. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +/-40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-{\AA} break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses ~5? 1010Msolar, half-light radii ~3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities ~109 Msolar kpc-2.

	abstract = {Using photometry and spectroscopy of 183,487 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we present bivariate distributions of pairs of seven galaxy properties:\ four optical colors, surface brightness, radial profile shape as measured by the S{\'e}rsic index, and absolute magnitude. In addition, we present the dependence of local galaxy density (smoothed on 8 h -1 Mpc scales) on all of these properties. Several classic, well-known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal-to-noise ratio:\ the color-color relations of galaxies, the color-magnitude relations, the magnitude-surface brightness relation, and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude. We show that most of the i -band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used:\ -23.5 < M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/594/1/186/img1.gif] {img1.gif} < -17.0 mag and 17 < ? ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/594/1/186/img1.gif] {img1.gif} < 24 mag in 1 arcsec 2 [the notation z b represents the b band shifted blueward by a factor (1 + z )]. Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together. We provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies and other quantitative details of our results.},

	abstract = {We study the optical colors of 147,920 galaxies brighter than g * = 21, observed in five bands by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over ~100 deg 2 of high Galactic latitude sky along the celestial equator. The distribution of galaxies in the g *- r * versus u *- g * color-color diagram is strongly bimodal, with an optimal color separator of u *- r * = 2.22. We use visual morphology and spectral classification of subsamples of 287 and 500 galaxies, respectively, to show that the two peaks correspond roughly to early- (E, S0, and Sa) and late-type (Sb, Sc, and Irr) galaxies, as expected from their different stellar populations. We also find that the colors of galaxies are correlated with their radial profiles, as measured by the concentration index and by the likelihoods of exponential and de Vaucouleurs' profile fits. While it is well known that late-type galaxies are bluer than early-type galaxies, this is the first detection of a local minimum in their color distribution. In all SDSS bands, the counts versus apparent magnitude relations for the two color types are significantly different and demonstrate that the fraction of blue galaxies increases toward the faint end.},

@article{yang_etal05a,
	abstract = {We use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders in magnitude limited redshift surveys. Because, according to the current scenario of structure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter (CDM) haloes, we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our group finder. The method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership (in redshift space). This procedure is repeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. We find that the final groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratio assumed. We use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosity function (CLF), to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members and contamination by interlopers. Our group finder is more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) group finder in assigning galaxies in common dark matter haloes to a single group. We apply our group finder to the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and compare the resulting group properties with model predictions based on the CLF. For the ?CDM concordance cosmology, we find a clear discrepancy between the model and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. In order to match the observational results, we have to either increase the mass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level significantly higher than current observational estimates, or to assume ?8~= 0.7, compared with the concordance value of 0.9.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3, has a dark mass resolution of 6.26 ? 106 M?, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 ? 106 M?. At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 ? 18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 18203 Monte Carlo tracer pARTICLEs reaching a total pARTICLE count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes:\ primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

@article{bray_etal16a,
	abstract = {Comparisons between observational surveys and galaxy formation models find that dark matter haloes' mass can largely explain their galaxies' stellar mass. However, it remains uncertain whether additional environmental variables, known as assembly bias, are necessary to explain other galaxy properties. We use the Illustris simulation to investigate the role of assembly bias in producing galactic conformity by considering 18 000 galaxies with Mstellar > 2 ? 10^9?M?. We find a significant signal of galactic conformity:\ out to distances of about 10 Mpc, the mean red fraction of galaxies around redder galaxies is higher than around bluer galaxies at fixed stellar mass. Dark matter haloes exhibit an analogous conformity signal, in which the fraction of haloes formed at earlier times (old haloes) is higher around old haloes than around younger ones at fixed halo mass. A plausible interpretation of galactic conformity is the combination of the halo conformity signal with the galaxy colour--halo age relation:\ at fixed stellar mass, particularly towards the low-mass end, Illustris' galaxy colours correlate with halo age, with the reddest galaxies (often satellites) preferentially found in the oldest haloes. We explain the galactic conformity effect with a simple semi-empirical model, assigning stellar mass via halo mass (abundance matching) and galaxy colour via halo age (age matching). Regarding comparison to observations, we conclude that the adopted selection/isolation criteria, projection effects, and stacking techniques can have a significant impact on the measured amplitude of the conformity signal.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ~ 10^5 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h_70 10^(-2) Msolar yr^(-1) Mpc^(-3) at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (10^10 to 10^11 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 10^10 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic) h^(-1). We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

	abstract = {Aims:\ We compute photometric redshifts in the fourth public release of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. This unique multi-colour catalogue comprises u*, g', r', i', z' photometry in four deep fields of 1 deg2 each and 35 deg2 distributed over three wide fields.
	Methods:\ We used a template-fitting method to compute photometric redshifts calibrated with a large catalogue of 16 983 high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from the VVDS-F02, VVDS-F22, DEEP2, and the zCOSMOS surveys. The method includes correction of systematic offsets, template adaptation, and the use of priors. We also separated stars from galaxies using both size and colour information. 
    Results:\ Comparing with galaxy spectroscopic redshifts, we find a photometric redshift dispersion, ?? z/(1+z_s), of 0.028-0.30 and an outlier rate, |? z| ? 0.15? (1+z_s), of 3-4\% in the deep field at i'_AB < 24. In the wide fields, we find a dispersion of 0.037-0.039 and an outlier rate of 3-4\% at i'_AB < 22.5. Beyond i'_AB = 22.5 in the wide fields the number of outliers rises from 5\% to 10\% at i'_AB < 23 and i'_AB < 24, respectively. For the wide sample the systematic redshift bias stays below 1\% to i'_AB < 22.5, whereas we find no significant bias in the deep fields. We investigated the effect of tile-to-tile photometric variations and demonstrated that the accuracy of our photometric redshifts is reduced by at most 21\%. Application of our star-galaxy classifier reduced the contamination by stars in our catalogues from 60\% to 8\% at i'_AB < 22.5 in our field with the highest stellar density while keeping a complete galaxy sample. Our CFHTLS T0004 photometric redshifts are distributed to the community. Our release includes 592891 (i'_AB < 22.5) and 244701 (i'_AB < 24) reliable galaxy photometric redshifts in the wide and deep fields, respectively.

	abstract = {Void regions of the Universe offer a special environment for studying cosmology and galaxy formation, which may expose weaknesses in our understanding of these phenomena. Although galaxies in voids are observed to be predominately gas rich, star forming and blue, a subpopulation of bright-red void galaxies can also be found, whose star formation was shutdown long ago. Are the same processes that quench star formation in denser regions of the Universe also at work in voids? We compare the luminosity function of void galaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, to those from a galaxy formation model built on the Millennium simulation. We show that a global star formation suppression mechanism in the form of low-luminosity `radio-mode' active galactic nuclei (AGN) heating is sufficient to reproduce the observed population of void early types. Radio-mode heating is environment independent other than its dependence on dark matter halo mass, where, above a critical mass threshold of approximately Mvir ~ 10^12.5 Msolar, gas cooling on to the galaxy is suppressed and star formation subsequently fades. In the Millennium simulation, the void halo mass function is shifted with respect to denser environments, but still maintains a high-mass tail above this critical threshold. In such void haloes, radio-mode heating remains efficient and red galaxies are found; collectively these galaxies match the observed space density without any modification to the model. Consequently, galaxies living in vastly different large-scale environments but hosted by haloes of similar mass are predicted to have similar properties, consistent with observations.},

	abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance ? cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain:\ (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

	abstract = {We explore the redshift evolution of a curious correlation between the star formation properties of central galaxies and their satellites (`galactic conformity') at intermediate to high redshift (0.4 < z < 1.9). Using an extremely deep near-infrared survey, we study the distribution and properties of satellite galaxies with stellar masses, log(M*/M?) > 9.7, around central galaxies at the characteristic Schechter function mass, M ? M*. We fit the radial profiles of satellite number densities with simple power laws, finding slopes in the range -1.1 to -1.4 for mass-selected satellites, and -1.3 to -1.6 for passive satellites. We confirm the tendency for passive satellites to be preferentially located around passive central galaxies at 3? significance and show that it exists to at least z ? 2. Meanwhile, the quenched fraction of satellites around star-forming galaxies is consistent with field galaxies of equal stellar masses. We find no convincing evidence for a redshift-dependent evolution of these trends. One simple interpretation of these results is that only passive central galaxies occupy an environment that is capable of independently shutting off star formation in satellite galaxies. By examining the satellites of higher stellar mass star-forming galaxies (log(M*/M?) > 11), we conclude that the origin of galactic conformity is unlikely to be exclusively due to the host dark matter halo mass. A halo-mass-independent correlation could be established by either formation bias or a more physical connection between central and satellite star formation histories. For the latter, we argue that a star formation (or active galactic nucleus) related outburst event from the central galaxy could establish a hot halo environment which is then capable of quenching both central and satellite galaxies.},

	abstract = {Quenched central galaxies tend to reside in a preferentially quenched large-scale environment, a phenomenon that has been dubbed galactic conformity. Remarkably, this tendency persists out to scales far larger than the virial radius of the halo hosting the central. Therefore, conformity manifestly violates the widely adopted assumption that the dark matter halo mass Mvir exclusively governs galaxy occupation statistics. This paper is the first in a series studying the implications of the observed conformity signal for the galaxy--dark matter connection. We show that recent measurements of conformity on scales r ? 1--5 Mpc imply that central galaxy quenching statistics cannot be correctly predicted with the knowledge of Mvir alone. We also demonstrate that ejected (or `backsplash') satellites cannot give rise to the signal. We then invoke the age matching model, which is predicated on the co-evolution of galaxies and haloes. We find that this model produces a strong signal, and that central galaxies are solely responsible. We conclude that large-scale `two-halo' conformity represents a smoking gun of central galaxy assembly bias, and indicates that contemporary models of satellite quenching have systematically overestimated the influence of post-infall processes.},

	abstract = {Correlations between the star formation rates (SFRs) of nearby galaxies (so-called galactic conformity) have been observed for projected separations up to 4 Mpc, an effect not predicted by current semi-analytic models. We investigate correlations between the mass accretion rates (dMvir/dt) of nearby halos as a potential physical origin for this effect. We find that pairs of host halos "know about" each others' assembly histories even when their present-day separation is greater than thirty times the virial radius of either halo. These distances are far too large for direct interaction between the halos to explain the correlation in their dMvir/dt. Instead, halo pairs at these distances reside in the same large-scale tidal environment, which regulates dMvir/dt for both halos. Larger halos are less affected by external forces, which naturally gives rise to a mass dependence of the halo conformity signal. SDSS measurements of galactic conformity exhibit a qualitatively similar dependence on stellar mass, including how the signal varies with distance. Based on the expectation that halo accretion and galaxy SFR are correlated, we predict the scale-, mass- and redshift-dependence of large-scale galactic conformity, finding that the signal should drop to undetectable levels by z > 1. These predictions are testable with current surveys to z ~ 1; confirmation would establish a strong correlation between dark matter halo accretion rate and central galaxy SFR.},

@article{kauffmann15,
	abstract = {Two explanations have been put forward to explain the observed conformity between the colours and specific star formation rates (SFR/M*) of galaxies on large scales:\ (1) the formation times of their surrounding dark matter haloes are correlated (commonly referred to as `assembly bias'), (2) gas is heated over large scales at early times, leading to coherent modulation of cooling and star formation between well-separated galaxies (commonly referred to as `pre-heating'). To distinguish between the pre-heating and assembly bias scenarios, we search for relics of energetic feedback events in the neighbourhood of central galaxies with different specific SFRs. We find a significant excess of very high mass (log M* > 11.3) galaxies out to a distance of 2.5 Mpc around low SFR/M* central galaxies compared to control samples of higher SFR/M* central galaxies with the same stellar mass and redshift. We also find that very massive galaxies in the neighbourhood of low-SFR/M* galaxies have much higher probability of hosting radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). The radio-loud AGN fraction in neighbours with log M* > 11.3 is four times higher around passive, non star-forming centrals at projected distances of 1 Mpc and two times higher at projected distances of 4 Mpc. Finally, we carry out an investigation of conformity effects in the recently publicly released Illustris cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, which includes energetic input both from quasars and from radio mode accretion on to black holes. We do not find conformity effects of comparable amplitude on large scales in the simulations and we propose that gas needs to be pushed out of dark matter haloes more efficiently at high redshifts.},

@article{kauffmann_etal13,
	abstract = {The observed correlation between star formation in central galaxies and in their neighbours (a phenomenon dubbed `galactic conformity') is in need of a convincing physical explanation. To gain further insight, we use a volume-limited sample of galaxies with redshifts less than 0.03 drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 to investigate the scale dependence of the effect and how it changes as a function of the mass of the central galaxy. Conformity extends over a central galaxy stellar mass range spanning two orders of magnitude. The scale dependence and the precise nature of the effect depend on the mass of the central. In central galaxies with masses less than 1010 M?, conformity extends out to scales in excess of 4 Mpc, well beyond the virial radii of their dark matter haloes. For low-mass central galaxies, conformity with neighbours on very large scales is only seen when they have low star formation rate or gas content. In contrast, at high stellar masses, conformity with neighbours applies in the gas-rich regime and is clearly confined to scales comparable to the virial radius of the dark matter halo of the central galaxy. Our analysis of a mock catalogue from the Guo et al. semi-analytic models shows that conformity-like effects arise because gas-poor satellite galaxies are sometimes misclassified as centrals. However, the effects in the models are much weaker than observed. Misclassification only influences the low-end tail of the SFR/M* distribution of neighbouring galaxies at large distances from the primary. The median and the upper percentiles of the SFR/M* distribution remain almost unchanged, which is in contradiction with the data. We speculate that the conformity between low-mass, gas-poor central galaxies and their distant neighbours may be a signature of `pre-heating' of the intergalactic gas at an earlier epoch.

	abstract = {We analyze the angular clustering of z ~ 2.3 distant red galaxies (DRGs) measured by Quardi et al. We find that, with robust estimates of the measurement errors and realistic halo occupation distribution modeling, the measured clustering can be well fit within standard halo occupation models, in contrast to previous results. However, in order to fit the strong break in w(?) at ? = 10'', nearly all satellite galaxies in the DRG luminosity range are required to be DRGs. Within this luminosity-threshold sample, the fraction of galaxies that are DRGs is ~44\%, implying that the formation of DRGs is more efficient for satellite galaxies than for central galaxies. Despite the evolved stellar populations contained within DRGs at z = 2.3, 90\% of satellite galaxies in the DRG luminosity range have been accreted within 500 Myr. Thus, satellite DRGs must have known they would become satellites well before the time of their accretion. This implies that the formation of DRGs correlates with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass, although the large-scale bias of DRGs can be well fit without such assumptions. Further data are required to resolve this issue. Using the observational estimate that ~30\% of DRGs have no ongoing star formation, we infer a timescale for star formation quenching for satellite galaxies of 450 Myr, although the uncertainty on this number is large. However, unless all non-star-forming satellite DRGs were quenched before accretion, the quenching timescale is significantly shorter than z ~ 0 estimates. Down to the completeness limit of the Quadri et al. sample, we find that the halo masses of central DRGs are ~50\% higher than non-DRGs in the same luminosity range, but at the highest halo masses the central galaxies are DRGs only ~2/3 of the time.},

	abstract = {We explore a possible origin for the puzzling anti-correlation between the formation epoch of galactic dark-matter haloes and their environment density. This correlation has been revealed from cosmological N-body simulations and is in conflict with the extended Press-Schechter model of halo clustering. Using similar simulations, we first quantify the straightforward association of an early formation epoch with a reduced mass-growth rate at late times. We then find that a primary driver of suppressed growth, by accretion and mergers, is tidal effects dominated by a neighbouring massive halo. The tidal effects range from a slowdown of the assembly of haloes due to the shear along the large-scale filaments that feed the massive halo to actual mass loss in haloes that pass through the massive halo. Using the restricted three-body problem, we show that haloes are prone to tidal mass loss within 1.5 virial radii of a larger halo. Our results suggest that the dependence of the formation epoch on environment density is a secondary effect induced by the enhanced density of haloes in filaments near massive haloes where the tides are strong. Our measures of assembly rate are particularly correlated with the tidal field at high redshifts z ~ 1.},

	abstract = {{We use galaxy--galaxy lensing to study the dark matter haloes surrounding a sample of locally brightest galaxies (LBGs) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We measure mean halo mass as a function of the stellar mass and colour of the central galaxy. Mock catalogues constructed from semi-analytic galaxy formation simulations demonstrate that most LBGs are the central objects of their haloes, greatly reducing interpretation uncertainties due to satellite contributions to the lensing signal. Over the full stellar mass range, 10.3 \\&lt; log?[M*/M?] \\&lt; 11.6, we find that passive central galaxies have haloes that are at least twice as massive as those of star-forming objects of the same stellar mass. The significance of this effect exceeds 3? for log?[M*/M?] \\&gt; 10.7. Tests using the mock catalogues and on the data themselves clarify the effects of LBG selection and show that it cannot artificially induce a systematic dependence of halo mass on LBG colour. The bimodality in halo mass at fixed stellar mass is reproduced by the astrophysical model underlying our mock catalogue, but the sign of the effect is inconsistent with recent, nearly parameter-free age-matching models. The sign and magnitude of the effect can, however, be reproduced by halo occupation distribution models with a simple (few-parameter) prescription for type dependence.}},

@article{chabrier03,
	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present?day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy---disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters---and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power?law form for m?1 M? and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc ? 0.08 M? and a variance in logarithmic mass ? ? 0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc ? 0.2 M? and ? ? 0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L? and T?dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD ? n* ? 0.1 pc?3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages ?130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick?disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc ? 0.2--0.3 M?, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ?1 M?. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present?day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present?day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass?to?light ratio determinations. The mass?to?light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8--1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans?type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super?Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large?scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.},

	abstract = {{We develop a simple analytic model for the gravitational clustering of dark matter haloes to understand how their spatial distribution is biased relative to that of the mass. The statistical distribution of dark haloes within the initial density field (assumed Gaussian) is determined by an extension of the Press-Schechter formalism. Modifications of this distribution caused by gravitationally induced motions are treated using a spherical collapse approximation. We test this model against results from a variety of N-body simulations, and find that it gives an accurate description of a bias function, b (M, R, ?) = ?h(M, R, ?)/?, where ?h(M, R, where ?) is the mean overdensity of haloes of mass M within spheres which have radius R and mass overdensity ?; the results depend only very weakly on how haloes are identified in the simulations. This bias function is sufficient to calculate the cross-correlation between dark haloes and mass, and again we find excellent agreement between simulation results and analytic predictions. Because haloes are spatially exclusive, the variance in the count of objects within spheres of fixed radius and overdensity is significantly smaller than the Poisson value. This seriously complicates any analytic calculation of the autocorrelation function of dark haloes. Our simulation results show, however, that this autocorrelation function is proportional to that of the mass over a wide range in R, even including scales where both functions are significantly greater than unity. Furthermore, the constant of proportionality is very close to that predicted on large scales by the analytic model. Since analytic formulae for the nonlinear autocorrelation function of the mass are already known, this result permits an entirely analytic estimate of the autocorrelation function of dark haloes. We use our model to study how the distribution of galaxies may be biased with respect to that of the mass. In conjunction with other data these techniques should make it possible to measure the amplitude of cosmic mass fluctuations and the density of the Universe.}},

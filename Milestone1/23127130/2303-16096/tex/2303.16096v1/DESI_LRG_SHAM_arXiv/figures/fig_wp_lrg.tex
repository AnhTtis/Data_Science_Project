    \caption{Predicted clustering of IR (top row) and optical (bottom row) mock LRGs compared to the clustering of the relevant LRG target samples from the data (black points in each panel).
    Dotted purple lines in each panel show mock LRGs from the default $z$-band model (monotonic correspondence between $r-z$ color and \zstarve at fixed luminosity), while solid purple lines show LRGs from the $z$-band model with randomized colors.
    Dashed orange lines in each panel show mock LRGs from the default $W1$-band model, and solid orange lines show LRGs from the $W1$-band model with randomized colors.
    Each column shows a different redshift bin.

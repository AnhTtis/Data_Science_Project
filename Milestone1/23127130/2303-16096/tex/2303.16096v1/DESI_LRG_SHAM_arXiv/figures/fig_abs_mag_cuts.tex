\caption{Distribution of $K$-corrected $z$-band (left column) and $W1$-band (right column) absolute magnitudes for the three redshift bins in our study:\ ${0.4 < \zphot < 0.5}$ (top), ${0.5 < \zphot < 0.6}$ (middle), and ${0.6 < \zphot < 0.7}$ (bottom). Each panel shows the distribution of all galaxies with $z<20.7$ (solid gray), as well as the distributions of optical (hatched purple; see Eq.~\ref{eq:lrg_opt}) and IR (solid orange; see Eq.~\ref{eq:lrg_ir}) DESI LRG targets. The leftmost dashed black line in each panel is the absolute magnitude cut that defines each absolute magnitude-limited parent galaxy sample for our models. At fainter magnitudes (to the left of the cut in each panel) the DECaLS sample is incomplete. The three dotted black lines in each panel denote the luminosity bins used to constrain model parameters (see \S\ref{subsec:error} and Tables \ref{tab:parent_samples} and \ref{tab:mag_bins}).

    \caption{Predicted HODs of IR (top row) and optical (bottom row) mock LRGs from both the $z$-band (heavier purple lines) and $W1$-band (heavier orange lines) models. Also shown in fainter purple and orange lines are HODs of the $z$-band and $W1$-band magnitude-limited mock galaxy catalogs from which mock LRGs are selected. Solid (dotted) lines show results for central (satellite) galaxies and LRGs.
    Each column shows a different redshift bin.
    The best-fit values of a standard five-parameter HOD model, as well as the satellite fraction, for each mock LRG sample are given in Table~\ref{tab:hod_params}.

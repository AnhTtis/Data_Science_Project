\caption{
Illustration of the model color assignment procedure (\S\ref{subsec:color_assign}), which equates halo \zstarve with galaxy color at fixed luminosity. The purple dotted curve is the cumulative distribution of $^{0.43}(r-z)$ color for galaxies in the $-23.0 > {^{0.43}M_z} > -23.05$ luminosity bin, while the gray solid curve is the cumulative distribution of halo \zstarve for mock galaxies in the same luminosity bin. The magenta arrows indicate that a mock galaxy in this luminosity bin in a halo with $\zstarve\approx2.6$ is assigned a $^{0.43}(r-z)$ color of $0.96$. The faint purple and gray curves are the galaxy color and halo \zstarve distributions of additional luminosity bins.

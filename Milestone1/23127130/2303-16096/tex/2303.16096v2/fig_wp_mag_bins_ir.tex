\caption{Luminosity-binned projected clustering of the $W1$-band absolute magnitude-limited parent galaxy samples and corresponding mock galaxy catalogs, with different colors and line styles representing different luminosity bins as denoted by the legend in each panel. Luminosity bins are offset by 0.15 dex for clarity.
Each panel shows a different redshift bin.
The shaded region at $\rp < 0.1\ \Mpch$ denotes measurements not used for modeling.

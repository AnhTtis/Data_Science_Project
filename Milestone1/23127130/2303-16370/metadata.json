    "abstract": "This paper proposes an acoustic beam splitter based on acoustic Luneburg lens. A two-dimensional acoustic Luneburg lens with gradient refractive index is achieved to provide a practical realization for the acoustic beam splitter. The acoustic wave propagation through the beam splitter was explored theoretically, numerically and experimentally. Results show that three output channels can be achieved using a point source on the edge of the beam splitter in a broadband frequency range. Furthermore, the output channel directions can be tuned via changing the design parameter.",

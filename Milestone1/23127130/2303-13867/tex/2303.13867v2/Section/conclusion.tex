\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose CAT-Net, Cross Attention Transformer network for few-shot medical image segmentation.
Our CAT-Net enables mutual interaction between the query and support features by the cross masked attention module, enhancing the representation abilities for both of them.
Additionally, the proposed CMAT module can be iteratively applied to continually boost the segmentation performance.
Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of each module and the superior performance of our model to the SOTA methods.
 In the future, we plan to extend our CAT-Net from 2D to 3D networks, explore the application of our model to other medical image segmentation tasks, as well as the extension of our model to other medical-related tasks.

\caption{Details of the MIFE architecture. The multi-level features (3$_{rd}$ and 4$_{th}$ block of 5) are combined to modify spatial size and reduce dimension. Subsequently, the support mask is expanded and merged with $F^q$ and $F^s$. Then, the query feature is combined with a prior mask to enhance the correlation between query and support features by computing the pixel-wise similarity between their high-level features (5$_{th}$ block).

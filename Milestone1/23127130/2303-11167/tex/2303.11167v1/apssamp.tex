\begin{abstract}
Quantum discord represents a correlation beyond classicality that could be useful for many quantum information tasks, and therefore is viewed as a valuable quantum resource. Theoretically, whether a bipartite quantum state has a non-zero amount of quantum discord or not can be determined once its density matrix is given. Experimentally, however, it is not easy to perform a reliable tomography on the state, especially when considering the imperfection of devices. Here, inspired by the so-called dimension witness, we propose a new approach using uncharacterized measurements to witness quantum discord of an unknown bipartite state within arbitrary dimension system. For any two-qubit state, we show that the maximum of witness happens when one performs mutually orthogonal basis measurement on each qubit. The feature of high robustness against device imperfections, such as loss-tolerance and error-tolerance, shows our method is experimentally feasible. Furthermore, we show that this witness can help us guarantee security in quantum key distribution.

\section{\label{sec:level1}Introduction}

\noindent 

Quantum discord is one type of correlation of quantumness \cite{ollivier2001quantum,modi2012classical}, and unlike entanglement \cite{horodecki2009quantum}, exists in a wide rang of bipartite quantum states. Since quantum discord shows its power in diversified tasks, such as mixed state quantum computing \cite{knill1998power,datta2008quantum}, remote state preparation \cite{dakic2012quantum}, coherent quantum interactions \cite{gu2012observing}, bounding distributed entanglement \cite{chuan2012quantum}, quantum channel discrimination \cite{weedbrook2016discord}, quantum metrology \cite{girolami2013characterizing}, quantum state merging \cite{cavalcanti2011operational,madhok2011interpreting}, and other quantum information processes \cite{modi2012classical}, researchers have paid much attention to it in last two decades. One attractive characteristic of quantum discord is that it is not as fragile as entanglement. Even a separable state may carry a non-zero amount of quantum discord and thus, can be useful for achieving various quantum information tasks. Specifically, it can to some extent be preserved in a noisy environment.

Like other quantum resources, it is of significant importance to detect quantum discord. State tomography always works out, but it requires sufficient and accurate measurements. For instance, the number of measurement grows squarely when comes to a $d \times d$ dimensional bipartite systems. The demand of practical implementations sometimes limits the power of state tomography since real-world devices would not always work well, and therefore a much more practical approach to detect or witness the quantum discord is in need.

Since quantum discord is a kind of non-convex resource \cite{chitambar2019quantum,bera2017quantum}, a linear witness operator cannot detect it successfully when it comes to a separable state \cite{rahimi2010single}. Thus, a good witness should be nonlinear. Researchers have proposed several approaches \cite{bylicka2010witnessing,gessner2013local,zhang2011detecting,maziero2012classicality,girolami2012observable} towards the quantum discord witness and experimentally demonstrated it \cite{xu2010experimental,passante2011experimental,aguilar2012experimental,silva2013measuring}. However, all these approaches require perfect measurements. Up till now, a method to witness quantum discord with uncharacterized devices is still missing. 

Here, we solve this problem directly by proposing a method to witness quantum discord with uncharacterized devices. Inspired by dimension witness in a prepare-and-measure scenario with independent devices \cite{bowles2014certifying}, we propose a nonlinear witness that only requires three natural assumptions: i) source and measurement devices are independent, ii) the dimension of the system is given, iii) the state and measurements are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) in each experimental round. In this paper, we first discuss the simplest case of two-qubit discord witness, and then generalize it to arbitrary dimension. In the case of two-qubit, we analyze a model of Bell-like experiment (see Fig. 1), and present the sufficient condition of successful witness. Furthermore, given any density matrix of two qubits, we construct explicitly the measurement operators that enable the discord witness to achieve a maximal value.

In this work, we will show that our approach is both loss-tolerant and error-tolerant, and the required number of measurements only grow linearly within $d \times d$ dimensional bipartite system, thus, our demands on devices are quite loose and our approach is extremely robust to device imperfections. As for applications, we show that our approach can be used in secure quantum key distribution (QKD)\cite{BB84,gisin2002quantum,scarani2009security,lo2014secure,pirandola2020advances,xu2020secure} in some scenarios. Actually, the idea that quantum discord can be viewed as a resource for quantum cryptography was first proposed by Pirandola \cite{pirandola2014quantum}, but that work mainly discussed the security based on characterized devices, which didn't take advantage of the fact that quantum discord is intrinsically measurement independent \cite{ollivier2001quantum,modi2012classical}. Here, we go one step further, showing how to make use of our witness to guarantee secure QKD and the advantages over standard BB84 protocol \cite{BB84} by achieving a higher key rate and being feasible with uncharacterized devices.


%From the experimental view, witnessing quantum discord means that one should identically measure the unknown but identical two-qubit state round by round, and collect the data to see whether it is zero-discord or not. However, since the state as well as the measurement may fluctuate as experiment goes by, 


 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Model} 

We consider the two-qubit witness experiment described by following steps. Step 1: in each round, a source prepares an unknown two-qubit state $\rho_{AB}$, and sends each of them to Alice and Bob respectively. Step 2: Alice (Bob) randomly chooses $x \in \{0, 1\}$ ($y \in \{0, 1\}$), performs a random two-dimensional positive operator-valued measure (POVM) $A_x$ ($B_y$) on her (his) qubit and obtains the outcome $a \in \{0, 1\}$ ($b \in \{0, 1\}$). Step 3: after all rounds have finished, Alice and Bob collect the data and calculate the expectation values $\left \langle A_x \right \rangle = p(a=0|x)-p(a=1|x)=\text{Tr}[\rho_{A}A_x ]$, $\left \langle B_y \right \rangle = p(b=0|y)-p(b=1|y)=\text{Tr}[\rho_{B}B_x ]$ and $\left \langle A_x \otimes B_y \right \rangle = p(a \oplus b=0|xy)-p(a \oplus b=1|xy)=\text{Tr}[\rho_{AB}A_x \otimes B_y]$, where $\rho_A$ ($\rho_B$) is Alice's (Bob's) subsystem. The brief set-up is shown in Fig. 1. Here, we list three assumptions in our approach: 1) the source and the measurement devices of Alice and Bob are independent \cite{bowles2014certifying}, 2) the subsystems of Alice and Bob are two-dimensional, 3) the state and measurements are i.i.d in each round. The second and third assumptions are easy to understand, here we briefly review the first assumption \cite{bowles2014certifying}: considering a hidden variable model where the POVM $A_x (\lambda_a)$, $B_y (\lambda_b)$ and the state $\rho_{AB}(\lambda_s)$ are respectively controlled by hidden variables $\lambda_a$, $\lambda_b$ and $\lambda_s$, and these hidden variables are unknown to the observer and satisfy $\int d \lambda_a q(\lambda_a)=\int d \lambda_b r(\lambda_b)=\int d \lambda_s t(\lambda_s)=1$ where $q(\lambda_a)$, $r(\lambda_b)$ and $t(\lambda_s)$ are marginal probability density functions, then the independence of all devices means that the global probability density function denoted by $p(\lambda_a \lambda_b \lambda_s)=q(\lambda_a)r(\lambda_b)t(\lambda_s)$, thus the observable probability is given by 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\left \langle A_x \otimes B_y \right \rangle =p(a \oplus b=0|xy)-p(a \oplus b=1|xy) \\
=&2 \int d \lambda_a d \lambda_b d \lambda_s  p(\lambda_a \lambda_b \lambda_s)  
     p(a \oplus b=0|xy \lambda_a \lambda_b \lambda_s) - 1 \\
                              = & \text{Tr}[\rho_{AB}A_x \otimes B_y], \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and we have same arguments on $\left \langle A_x \right \rangle$ and $\left \langle B_y \right \rangle$. This independence assumption is different from those used in the testing of Bell's inequality \cite{brunner2014bell}. Figuratively speaking, source and measurement devices in our case are made by independent vendors that do not collude with each other, and are placed in different laboratories that are independent of each other, but it's not that case in Bell's inequality testing.


%Therefore, we claim that the our required assumptions are quite natural.

%the measurement operators are two-dimensional with partially characterized form $A_x=\vec{A}_x \cdot \vec{\sigma} $ ($B_y=\vec{B}_y \cdot \vec{\sigma} $), where $\vec{A}_x$ ($\vec{B}_y$) is a Bloch vector and $\vec{\sigma}=(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrix.

\section{Main result}

Here, we first present the witness form and then derive that any zero-discord two-qubit state always leads to zero witness value. We define $Q_{xy}:= \left \langle A_x \otimes B_y \right \rangle - \left \langle A_x \right \rangle \left \langle B_y \right \rangle $, then the witness value is given by the following determinant
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
W:=
\begin{vmatrix}
Q_{00} & Q_{01}  \\
Q_{10} & Q_{11}
\end{vmatrix}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In Bloch representation, we have 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{AB}=\frac{1}{4}(\mathbb{I} \otimes \mathbb{I} +\vec{S}_a \cdot \vec{\sigma} \otimes \mathbb{I} + \mathbb{I} \otimes \vec{S}_b \cdot \vec{\sigma} + \vec{\sigma}^t \hat{T} \vec{\sigma}),
\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{I}$ is the identity matrix, $\vec{\sigma}=(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)^t $ is the vector of Pauli matrix, $\vec{S}_a$ and $\vec{S}_b$ are the local Bloch vector for $\rho_A=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbb{I}+\vec{S}_a \cdot \vec{\sigma}$) and $\rho_B=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbb{I}+\vec{S}_b \cdot \vec{\sigma}$), respectively, and $\hat{T}$ is the $3 \times 3$ correlation tensor matrix. For measurement operator, $A_x=a_x\mathbb{I}+\vec{A}_x \cdot \vec{\sigma}$ and $B_y=b_y\mathbb{I}+\vec{B}_y \cdot \vec{\sigma}$, where $a_x$ and $b_y$ are constants, $\vec{A}_x$ and $\vec{B}_y$ are also Bloch vectors with constraints $|a_x| \le 1-|\vec{A}_x|$ and $|b_x| \le 1-|\vec{B}_y|$. Then we have 
\begin{equation}
\left \langle A_x \otimes B_y \right \rangle=a_x b_y +\vec{S}_a \cdot \vec{A}_x b_y + a_x \vec{S}_b \cdot \vec{B}_y + \vec{A}^t_x \hat{T} \vec{B}_y.
\end{equation}
Similarly, 
\begin{equation}
\left \langle A_x \right \rangle \left \langle B_y \right \rangle = (a_x+\vec{S}_a \cdot \vec{A}_x) (b_y + \vec{S}_b \cdot \vec{B}_y),
\end{equation}
then, we have
\begin{equation}
Q_{xy} = \vec{A}^t_x \hat{T} \vec{B}_y - (\vec{S}_a \cdot \vec{A}_x) (\vec{S}_b \cdot \vec{B}_y)=\vec{A}^t_x (\hat{T}-\vec{S}_a\vec{S}^t_b) \vec{B}_y .
\end{equation}
To simplify, we define a $3 \times 3$ matrix $\hat{S}:=\hat{T}-\vec{S}_a\vec{S}^t_b$, as a consequence, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{W}
\begin{aligned}
W&= 
\begin{vmatrix}
\vec{A}^t_0 \hat{S} \vec{B}_0 & \vec{A}^t_0 \hat{S} \vec{B}_1  \\
\vec{A}^t_1 \hat{S} \vec{B}_0 & \vec{A}^t_1 \hat{S} \vec{B}_1
\end{vmatrix} \\
&=(\vec{A}_0 \times \vec{A}_1) \cdot (\hat{S}\vec{B}_0 \times \hat{S}\vec{B}_1). \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
It is straightforward to see that the witness would vanish if the rank of $\hat{S}$ is one or zero. Then we shall show that any zero-discord two-qubit state will always be in that case. As proved in \cite{datta2008studies}, the zero-discord state can be written as $\chi_{AB}=p_0\ket{0}\bra{0} \otimes \rho_0+p_1\ket{1}\bra{1} \otimes \rho_1$, where
$\{\ket{0}, \ket{1}\}$ is  an orthonormal basis of Alice's system, $\rho_{0, 1}$ are $2 \times 2$ density matrices of Bob's system. In Bloch representation, it is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\chi_{AB} =& \frac{1}{4}(\mathbb{I} \otimes \mathbb{I} + (p_0-p_1) \sigma_z \otimes \mathbb{I} \\
                 &+\mathbb{I} \otimes (p_0\vec{s}_0+p_1\vec{s}_1) \cdot \vec{\sigma} \\
                 &+\sigma_z \otimes (p_0\vec{s}_0-p_1\vec{s}_1) \cdot \vec{\sigma}), \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{s}_{0 ,1}$ are the Bloch vectors for $\rho_{0, 1}=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbb{I}+\vec{s}_{0, 1} \cdot \vec{\sigma})$. After simple calculation, the matrix $\hat{S}$ for $\chi_{AB}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\hat{S}_{\chi} := (\vec{0}, \vec{0}, 2p_0p_1(\vec{s}_0-\vec{s}_1))^t, 
\end{equation}
where the three elements of both first row and second row are all zero, and thus the rank of $\hat{S}_{\chi}$ is one or zero. So, we claim that a non-zero value of $W$ is a necessary condition for non-zero discord, therefore, we conclude that the zero-discord two-qubit states always have a vanishing witness.

In the following, given any density matrix of two qubits, we find explicitly the measurement operators that allow the discord witness to achieve a maximal value, provided a fixed $\rho_{AB}$. Let $\vec{i}=\vec{B}_0/|\vec{B}_0|$ and $\vec{j}=\vec{B}_1/|\vec{B}_1|$ be the unit vectors respectively, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the first and second largest eigenvalue of matrix $|\hat{S}|$ respectively, using the fact that Bloch vectors $0 \le |\vec{A}_x| \le 1$ and $0 \le |\vec{B}_y| \le 1$, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
W & \le |\vec{A}_0 \times \vec{A}_1| \cdot |\hat{S}\vec{B}_0 \times \hat{S}\vec{B}_1| \\
    & \le |\hat{S}\vec{B}_0 \times \hat{S}\vec{B}_1| \\
    & \le |\hat{S}\vec{i} \times \hat{S}\vec{j}| \\
    & \le k_1k_2, \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the equality of the first inequality holds if vectors $\vec{A}_0 \times \vec{A}_1$ and $\hat{S}\vec{B}_0 \times \hat{S}\vec{B}_1$ are in the same direction, the equality of the second inequality holds if $\vec{A}_x$ are mutually orthogonal with $|\vec{A}_x|=1$, the equality of the third inequality holds if $|\vec{B}_y|=1$, and the equality of the last inequality holds if $\vec{B}_y$ are mutually orthogonal and the plane formed by eigenvectors of $k_1$ and $k_2$ is the same as the plane formed by $\vec{B}_y$. For the last inequality in above formula, we have made use of the fact that
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
|\hat{S}\vec{i} \times \hat{S}\vec{j}| & = \frac{1}{2}|\hat{S} (\vec{i}+\vec{j}) \times \hat{S}(\vec{i}-\vec{j})| \\ 
                                                        & = \left| 2\cos\theta \sin\theta \frac{\hat{S} (\vec{i}+\vec{j})}{|\vec{i}+\vec{j}|} \times \frac{\hat{S} (\vec{i}-\vec{j})}{|\vec{i}-\vec{j}|} \right| \\
                                                        & \le \left| \frac{\hat{S} (\vec{i}+\vec{j})}{|\vec{i}+\vec{j}|} \times \frac{\hat{S} (\vec{i}-\vec{j})}{|\vec{i}-\vec{j}|} \right|, \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $2\theta \in (-\pi/2, \pi/2]$ is the angle of vectors $\vec{i}$ and $\vec{j}$, we make use of the inequality $2\cos\theta \sin\theta \le \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta=1$ and thus the equality holds if $\theta=\pi/4$, that is, $\vec{i}$ and $\vec{j}$ are mutually orthogonal. Thus, witness value comes to maximum if and only if $\vec{A}_x$ as well as $\vec{B}_y$ are some apposite mutually orthogonal unit vectors, depending on matrix $\hat{S}$. In other word, the measurements should be two mutually orthogonal basis (MUB) on both Alice's and Bob's sides. 

%Furthermore, if we consider a model of a time-varying devices, that is the two-qubit state and measurement change in each round, the condition still holds, the proof can be found in Appendix.

\section{High-dimensional case} 

Here we consider the zero-discord state $\chi_{AB}=\sum_{i=0}^{d_A-1} p_i\ket{i}\bra{i} \otimes \rho_i$ and the similar experiment scenario of Fig. 1 with inputs $x, y \in \{0, 1, \cdots, d_A-1\}$ and outputs $a, b \in \{0, 1\}$, where $d_A$ is the dimension of Alice's system. Similarly, we construct the $d_A \times d_A$ matrix $\hat{W}_{d_A}$ and its element at row $x$, column $y$ that $Q_{xy}= \left \langle A_x \otimes B_y \right \rangle - \left \langle A_x \right \rangle \left \langle B_y \right \rangle $. Similarly, the witness value is given by the determinant $W_{d_A}=\det(\hat{W}_{d_A})$. Then we choose basis sets of local Hermitian operators $\{ \tau_1, \cdots, \tau_i, \cdots, \tau_{d^2_A} \}$ ($\{ \upsilon_1, \cdots, \upsilon_j, \cdots, \upsilon_{d^2_A} \}$), where $\tau_1=\mathbb{I}_{d_A}/\sqrt{d_A}$ ($\upsilon_1=\mathbb{I}_{d_B}/\sqrt{d_B}$) is proportional to the identity matrix and they satisfy $\Tr[\tau_i \tau_{i^{'}}]=\delta_{i i^{'}}$ ($\Tr[\upsilon_j \upsilon_{j^{'}}]=\delta_{j j^{'}}$). Then any bipartite state is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\rho_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_A d_B}}( &\tau_1 \otimes \upsilon_1 + \sqrt{d_A-1} \vec{S}_a \cdot \vec{\tau} \otimes \upsilon_1  \\
&+ \sqrt{d_B-1}\tau_1 \otimes \vec{S}_b \cdot \vec{\upsilon} \\
&+ \sqrt{(d_A-1)(d_B-1)} \vec{\tau}^t \hat{T} \vec{\upsilon}), \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{S}_a \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2_A-1}$ ($\vec{S}_b \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2_B-1}$), $|\vec{S}_a| \le 1$ ($|\vec{S}_b| \le 1$), $\vec{\tau}=(\tau_2, \cdots, \tau_{d^2_A})^t$ ($\vec{\upsilon}=(\upsilon_2, \cdots, \upsilon_{d^2_B})^t$) is the vector of the $d^2_A-1$ ($d^2_B-1$) generalized Gell-Mann matrices. For measurement operator, we have $A_x=\sqrt{d_A} (a_x\tau_1+  \sqrt{d_A-1} \vec{A}_x \cdot \vec{\tau})$ ( $B_y=\sqrt{d_B} (b_y\upsilon_1+  \sqrt{d_B-1} \vec{B}_y \cdot \vec{\upsilon})$), where $\vec{A}_x \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2_A-1}$ ($\vec{B}_y \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2_B-1}$), $|\vec{A}_x| \le 1$ ($|\vec{B}_y| \le 1$) with the constant $|a_x|+(d_A-1)|\vec{A}_x| \le 1$ ($|b_y|+(d_B-1)|\vec{B}_y| \le 1$). Then we get the element 
\begin{equation}
Q_{xy} =(d_A-1)(d_B-1) \vec{A}^t_x (\hat{T}-\vec{S}^t_a\vec{S}_b) \vec{B}_y .
\end{equation}
Thus, as above, we get the $(d^2_A-1) \times (d^2_B-1)$ matrix $\hat{S}=\hat{T}-\vec{S}_a\vec{S}^t_b$, and similarly to \eqref{W}, the generalized witness of arbitrary dimensions can be expressed by using cross product that 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
W_{d_A}& =\det(\hat{W}_{d_A}) =[(d_A-1)(d_B-1)]^{d_A} \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} , \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{A}:=\vec{A}_0 \times \vec{A}_1 \times\cdots \times \vec{A}_{d_A-1}$ and $\vec{B}:=\hat{S}\vec{B}_0 \times \hat{S}\vec{B}_1 \times\cdots \times \hat{S}\vec{B}_{d_A-1}$
of $d_A$ vectors are defined in $\mathbb{R}^{d_A+1}$ \cite{bowles2014certifying,dittmer1994cross}. Therefore, we immediately have that $\vec{B}=\vec{0}$ if and only if $\hat{S}\vec{B}_0, \cdots, \hat{S}\vec{B}_{d_A-1}$ are linearly dependent, and this condition can be guaranteed if the rank of $\hat{S}$ is not greater than $d_A-1$. Then we shall prove that the rank of the matrix $\hat{S}$ for $\chi_{AB}$  is bounded by $d_A-1$. In the representation of Hermitian operator, we define $\ket{i}\bra{i}=(\tau_1 + \sqrt{d_A-1} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{\tau})/\sqrt{d_A}$ with $1+ (d_A-1)\vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{r}_{i^{'}}=0$ (if $i \neq i^{'}$) and $\rho_i=(\tau_1 + \sqrt{d_B-1} \vec{s}_i \cdot \vec{\upsilon}_i)/\sqrt{d_B}$, then we get 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\chi_{AB} =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_A d_B}}( \tau_1 \otimes \upsilon_1  + \sqrt{d_A-1} \sum_i p_i \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{\tau} \otimes \upsilon_1  \\
               &+ \sqrt{d_B-1}\tau_1 \otimes \sum_i p_i \vec{s}_i \cdot \vec{\upsilon} \\
               &+ \sqrt{(d_A-1)(d_B-1)} \vec{\tau}^t \sum_i p_i \vec{r}_i \vec{s}^t_i \vec{\upsilon}). \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
As above, we have the matrix $\hat{S}$ for $\chi_{AB}$ given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\hat{S}_{\chi} =& \sum_i p_i \vec{r}_i \vec{s}^t_i- (\sum_i p_i \vec{r}_i) (\sum_{i^{'}} p_{i^{'}} \vec{s}^t_{i^{'}}) \\
                      =& \sum_i p_i \vec{r}_i (\vec{s}_i- \sum_{i^{'}} p_{i^{'}} \vec{s}_{i^{'}})^t, \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where we can see that all the row vectors contained in the vector space spanned by $\vec{s}_i- \sum_{i^{'}} p_{i^{'}} \vec{s}_{i^{'}}$ for all $i \in \{0, \cdots, d_A-1\}$. It is straightforward to see that  these vectors are linearly dependent since we can make use of the probabilities $p_i$ with $\sum_i p_i=1$, resulting in 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\sum_i p_i \vec{s}_i- \sum_{i^{'}} p_{i^{'}} \vec{s}_{i^{'}}=0. 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the dimension of the vector space spanned by $\vec{s}_i- \sum_{i^{'}} p_{i^{'}} \vec{s}_{i^{'}}$ is at most $d_A-1$, that is, the rank of $\hat{S}_{\chi}$ is bounded by $d_A-1$, which we complete the proof. The key point of this our method is to make use of the fact that the rank of matrix $\hat{S}$ is always bounded by $d_A-1$ for every zero-discord state, and thus, for any $d_A-1$ linearly independent vectors $\vec{B}_0, \cdots, \vec{B}_{d_A-1}$, $\hat{S}\vec{B}_0, \cdots, \hat{S}\vec{B}_{d_A-1}$ are always linearly dependent. We conclude that the zero-discord states of arbitrary dimension always have a vanishing witness.

\section{Experimental aspects}

In the following, we discuss some experimental issues. First, to understand the robustness (the feature of loss-tolerance and error-tolerance) of our witness, we consider a model of channel loss, background error, finite and even basis-dependent detection efficiency in the two-qubit case. Let $\alpha_x$ be the total detection efficiency (including the channel efficiency and detector efficiency) on Alice's side, if the qubit vanishes before detection, or equivalently the detector outputs a "no click" or "double click" result, we label these outcomes as "0" and "1" randomly, then we can equivalently view that the qubit goes through a depolarization channel featured by transmittance $\alpha_x$ before the POVM $A_x$. Besides, the term $a_x\mathbb{I}$ in $A_x$ actually characterize the background error since its resulting probability $\text{Tr}[a_x\mathbb{I} \rho]$ is irrelevant to the form of any qubit $\rho$. We combine the depolarization channel and the POVM $A_x$ together into another POVM $A^{'}_x$ given by 
\begin{equation}
A^{'}_x =a_x\mathbb{I}+\alpha_x \vec{A}_x \cdot \vec{\sigma},
\end{equation}
then we can see that $W \to \alpha_0 \alpha_1 W$ is strictly positive whenever $W>0$. We can have a same argument on Bob's side by considering the total detection efficiency $\beta_y$ and the term $b_y\mathbb{I}$. And it is not hard to generalize such feature to high-dimensional case. Thus, an arbitrary low detection efficiency and an arbitrary high background error only make the witness value arbitrary low, but would not change it to zero, which shows the high robustness of our approach.

Second, if considering the bipartite state $\rho_{AB}$ within $d_A \times d_B$ where setting $d_A=d_B=d$,  the number of measurement grows only linearly by $d \times d$ in the new approach, but squarely in state tomography. To see this, we know that the freedom of $\rho_{AB}$ is $(d \times d)^2-1$, but our method just needs $d $ measurements on each side.

Here, we set $\vec{A}_0=\vec{B}_0=\vec{x}$ and $\vec{A}_1=\vec{B}_1=\vec{z}$. For $W_{\text{max}}$, we set detection efficiency is $100\%$ on both sides to evolute it, for $W_{\text{imp}}$, we set Alice's detection efficiency is $\alpha_0=0.75$ and $\alpha_1=0.8$, Bob's detection efficiency is $\beta_0=0.8$ and $\beta_1=0.625$, to evolute it.}

\end{figure}



Third, in Fig. 2, we take the two-qubit Werner state as an example to simulate the behavior of maximal achievable witness $W_{\text{max}}$ and $W_{\text{imp}}$ when considering the imperfection of device. The Werner state is given by $p\ket{\psi^-}\bra{\psi^-}+\frac{1-p}{4}\mathbb{I}_4$, where $\ket{\psi^-}=(\ket{01}-\ket{10})/\sqrt{2}$ is the singlet state, $\mathbb{I}_4$ is the identity matrix of four dimensional system and $p \in [0,1]$. The matrix $|\hat{S}|=|\hat{T}|$ with three eigenvalues $\{p, p, p\}$, then we can immediately have $W \le W_{\text{max}}=p^2$. It is straightforward to see that an alternative way to achieving the maximal witness for the Werner state is to perform $\mathbb{X}$-basis and $\mathbb{Z}$-basis measurements on both Alice's and Bob's sides, that is, $\vec{A}_0=\vec{B}_0=\vec{x}$ and $\vec{A}_1=\vec{B}_1=\vec{z}$. Actually, for the Werner state, arbitrary two projective measurements as long as they are MUB could help us achieve the maximal witness, because $\mathbb{I}_4$ and $\ket{\psi^-}\bra{\psi^-}$ are invariant under local rotations. Here we also consider the case of imperfect devices, by setting $\vec{A}_0=\vec{B}_0=\vec{x}$ and $\vec{A}_1=\vec{B}_1=\vec{z}$, Alice's detection efficiency is $\alpha_0=0.75$ and $\alpha_1=0.8$, and Bob's detection efficiency is $\beta_0=0.8$ and $\beta_1=0.625$, we have $W_{\text{imp}}=\alpha_0 \alpha_1 \beta_0 \beta_1 W_{\text{max}}=0.3p^2$. In Fig. 2, we can see that $W_{\text{max}} >0 $ and $W_{\text{imp}} >0 $ always hold when discord is nonzero, that is $ p>0 $, which is different from the well-known entanglement condition of such state when $p>1/3$. Coincidentally, for the Werner state, $W_{\text{max}}=p^2$ in our approach is same with the observable geometric discord \cite{dakic2010necessary} in Ref. \cite{girolami2012observable}, and differs with \cite{maziero2012classicality} only by a constant coefficient. Thus, while the previous method works, our method applies to uncharacterized measurements.

%Let $e_x$ be the background error

%Another feature of our method is that, as the dimension of the system increases, the number of measurement grows only linearly in the new approach, but squarely in state tomography. To see this, we know that the freedom of any bipartite state $\rho_{AB}$ is $(d_A \times d_B)^2-1$, but our method just needs $d_A $ measurements on each side.

\section{Guaranteeing quantum secure}

Quantum discord, as a measure of quantum correlation, has been proved to satisfy monogamic relation from Koashi-Winter relation \cite{koashi2004monogamy,fanchini2011conservation}, which suggests potential applications in QKD protocols. In Ref. \cite{pirandola2014quantum}, Pirandola investigated the connection between the amount of quantum discord and secure key rate based on both device-dependent and device-independent QKD protocols, and claimed that non-zero quantum discord is a precondition for secure QKD. However, there are still some gaps in applying quantum discord in QKD protocols, for example, we lack an approach to link the amount of quantum discord and observable values. Benefiting from our witness, we can go one step further, e.g., deriving the key rate from witness value that can be obtained from observable values. Moreover, by taking advantage of the intrinsic feature of quantum discord, we can effectively address some issues of practical implementations in QKD protocols, and even obtain better key rate than standard BB84 protocol in some scenarios. We shall discuss these issues detailedly in a work close at hand \cite{wang2022qubit}, where a QKD protocol will be proposed.

\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we propose a new approach to witnessing the quantum discord for arbitrary dimension, and show that it is highly robust against the imperfections of devices. The high robustness and the fact that the number of measurements grows linearly as the dimension of the system increases shows our method is experimentally feasible. Furthermore, we show that we can apply this witness to the security analysis in a QKD protocol.

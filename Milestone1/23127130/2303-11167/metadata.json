    "abstract": "Quantum discord represents a correlation beyond classicality that could be useful for many quantum information tasks, and therefore is viewed as a valuable quantum resource. Theoretically, whether a bipartite quantum state has a non-zero amount of quantum discord or not can be determined once its density matrix is given. Experimentally, however, it is not easy to perform a reliable tomography on the state, especially when considering the imperfection of devices. Here, inspired by the so-called dimension witness, we propose a new approach using uncharacterized measurements to witness quantum discord of an unknown bipartite state within arbitrary dimension system. For any two-qubit state, we show that the maximum of witness happens when one performs mutually orthogonal basis measurement on each qubit. The feature of high robustness against device imperfections, such as loss-tolerance and error-tolerance, shows our method is experimentally feasible. Furthermore, we show that this witness can help us guarantee security in quantum key distribution.",

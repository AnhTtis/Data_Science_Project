journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {We propose to build and operate a detector based on the emulsion film technology for the measurement of the gravitational acceleration on antimatter, to be performed by the AEgIS experiment (AD6) at CERN. The goal of AEgIS is  to test  the weak equivalence principle with a precision of 1\% on the gravitational acceleration g by measuring the vertical position of the annihilation  vertex of antihydrogen atoms after their free fall while moving horizontally in a vacuum pipe. With the emulsion technology developed at the University of Bern we propose to improve the  performance of  AEgIS by exploiting the superior position resolution of emulsion films over other particle detectors.  The idea is to use a new type of emulsion films, especially developed for applications in vacuum, to yield a spatial resolution of the order of one micron in the measurement of the sag of the antihydrogen atoms in the gravitational field. This is an order of magnitude better than what was planned in the original AEgIS proposal.}

abstract = {The new general-purpose fixed target experiment SHiP (Search for Hidden Particles) at the CERN SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) is aimed at research in the field of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics and of tau-neutrino physics. The Emulsion Neutrino Detector will be one of the main elements in the SHiP detector design. It is intended for search for Dark Matter scattering on electrons of nuclear emulsion and for tau-neutrino and anti tau-neutrino direct observation, and study their properties and the cross section. The main source of both hidden particle and tau-neutrino event fluxes is the decay of charmed particles produced in the SHiP proton target. The detection of the production and decay of charmed hadrons in the target will be performed through nuclear emulsion films employed in the Emulsion Cloud Chamber target structure. The paper describes the basic principles of the SHiP neutrino emulsion detector and some measures for its optimization.}

HTS, which has an extremely wide-field objective lens, reached a scanning speed of 4700 cm\\$^2\\$/h, which is nearly 100 times faster than the previous system and therefore strongly promotes many new experimental projects.

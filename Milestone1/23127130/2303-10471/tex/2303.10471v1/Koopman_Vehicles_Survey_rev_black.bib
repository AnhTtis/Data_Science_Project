This methodology is based on the use of operator theory to find a linear approximation to the ordinary differential equation in an expanded space of configuration. Once this linearization is performed, the Schur decomposition is used to transform the resultant differential equation into an upper triangular system that can be solved sequentially following the upper triangular structure. Based on these results, a perturbation technique is also proposed to study these problems. Finally, this work provides a set of algorithms to automate all the methodologies presented, with a special focus on polynomial differential equations and the use of Legendre polynomials to represent the dynamical system. Several examples of application are provided, including the Duffing oscillator, the Van der Pol oscillator, and the zonal harmonics problem around the moon.},

    title={Applications of {K}oopman Operator Theory to Highway Traffic Dynamics},
    author={Avila, Allan M},
    year={2017},
    school={University of California, Santa Barbara},
    abstract={The ever-increasing demands on transportation systems have led to the need for a robust and universal method for the analysis and forecasting of vehicular traffic systems. Traditional methods are mainly model-based, that is, the analysis is performed by investigating a mathematical model that represents the target dynamics of a traffic system. On the other hand, contemporary efforts have focused on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to model or forecast vehicular traffic dynamics. Despite these large efforts, there is still no single best-performing method for the analysis and forecasting of vehicular traffic dynamics. This is due to the very well known fact that the unpredictable behaviors involved in a traffic system, like human interaction and weather, leads to a very complicated high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a mathematical or AI model that explains all events and time evolution of vehicular traffic dynamics. Even if such a model could be attained, it would not lead to a robust and universal way of traffic analysis and forecast, due to its need of extensive parameter tuning. Thus, in contrast to the model or AI-based approach, it is necessary to develop data-driven methods that can identify dynamically important spatiotemporal structures of traffic phenomena. In this thesis, we demonstrate how the {K}oopman operator theory can offer a model and parameter-free, data-driven approach to accurately analyzing and forecasting traffic dynamics. The {K}oopman operator theory framework is a rapidly developing theory in dynamical systems that offers powerful methods for analyzing complex nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated v PREVIEW by an application to the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data set collected by the US Federal Highway Administration and the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) data set collected by the California Department of Transportation. By obtaining a {K}oopman mode decomposition (KMD) of the data sets, we are able to accurately reconstruct our observed dynamics, distinguish any growing or decaying modes, and obtain a hierarchy of coherent spatiotemporal patterns that are fundamental to the observed dynamics. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how the KMD can be utilized to accurately forecast traffic dynamics by obtaining a decomposition of a subset of the data, that is then used to predict a future subset of the data.},

This analysis aims at selecting numerical values for such parameters that lead to games that are “fair” or “balanced” in spite of the fact that the two players may have distinct attributes/capabilities. Motivated by applications of game balancing for the commercial gaming industry, our effort is focused on complex multi-agent games for which low-dimensional models in the form of differential or difference equations are not possible or not available. To overcome this challenge, we use a parameter-dependent {K}oopman operator to model the game evolution, which we train using an ensemble of simulation traces of the actual game. This model is subsequently used to determine values for the game parameters that optimize the appropriate game balancing criterion. The approach proposed here is illustrated and validated on a minigame derived from the StarCraft II real-time strategy game from Blizzard Entertainment.},

Eliminating discrete state variables provides computational benefits when using data-driven methods to learn the {K}oopman operator and its observables. Following this, we use deep learning to implement each representation on two test cases, discuss the challenges associated with those implementations, and propose areas of future work.},

    journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.05095},
    year={2021},
    abstract={Dynamical systems are ubiquitous and are often modeled using a non-linear system of governing equations. Numerical solution procedures for many dynamical systems have existed for several decades, but can be slow due to high-dimensional state space of the dynamical system. Thus, deep learning-based reduced order models (ROMs) are of interest and one such family of algorithms along these lines are based on the {K}oopman theory. This paper extends a recently developed adversarial {K}oopman model (Balakrishnan \& Upadhyay, arXiv:2006.05547) to stochastic space, where the {K}oopman operator applies on the probability distribution of the latent encoding of an encoder. Specifically, the latent encoding of the system is modeled as a Gaussian, and is advanced in time by using an auxiliary neural network that outputs two {K}oopman matrices $K_\mu$ and $K_\sigma$. Adversarial and gradient losses are used and this is found to lower the prediction errors. A reduced {K}oopman formulation is also undertaken where the {K}oopman matrices are assumed to have a tridiagonal structure, and this yields predictions comparable to the baseline model with full {K}oopman matrices. The efficacy of the stochastic {K}oopman model is demonstrated on different test problems in chaos, fluid dynamics, combustion, and reaction-diffusion models. The proposed model is also applied in a setting where the {K}oopman matrices are conditioned on other input parameters for generalization and this is applied to simulate the state of a Lithium-ion battery in time. The {K}oopman models discussed in this study are very promising for the wide range of problems considered.},

    abstract={Learning reservoir flow dynamics is of primary importance in creating robust predictive models for reservoir management including hydraulic fracturing processes. Physics-based models are to a certain extent exact, but they entail heavy computational infrastructure for simulating a wide variety of parameters and production scenarios. Reduced-order models offer computational advantages without compromising solution accuracy, especially if they can assimilate large volumes of production data without having to reconstruct the original model (data-driven models). Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) entails the extraction of relevant spatial structure (modes) based on data (snapshots) that can be used to predict the behavior of reservoir fluid flow in porous media. In this paper, we will further enhance the application of the DMD, by introducing sparse DMD and local DMD. The former is particularly useful when there is a limited number of sparse measurements as in the case of reservoir simulation, and the latter can improve the accuracy of developed DMD models when the process dynamics show a moving boundary behavior like hydraulic fracturing. For demonstration purposes, we first show the methodology applied to (flow only) single- and two-phase reservoir models using the SPE10 benchmark. Both online and offline processes will be used for evaluation. We observe that we only require a few DMD modes, which are determined by the sparse DMD structure, to capture the behavior of the reservoir models. Then, we applied the local DMDc for creating a proxy for application in a hydraulic fracturing process. We also assessed the trade-offs between problem size and computational time for each reservoir model. The novelty of our method is the application of sparse DMD and local DMDc, which is a data-driven technique for fast and accurate simulations.},

    abstract={The control of complex systems is of critical importance in many branches of science, engineering, and industry, many of which are governed by nonlinear partial differential equations. Controlling an unsteady fluid flow is particularly important, as flow control is a key enabler for technologies in energy (e.g., wind, tidal, and combustion), transportation (e.g., planes, trains, and automobiles), security (e.g., tracking airborne contamination), and health (e.g., artificial hearts and artificial respiration). However, the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multi-scale dynamics make real-time feedback control infeasible. Fortunately, these high-dimensional systems exhibit dominant, low-dimensional patterns of activity that can be exploited for effective control in the sense that knowledge of the entire state of a system is not required. Advances in machine learning have the potential to revolutionize flow control given its ability to extract principled, low-rank feature spaces characterizing such complex systems. We present a novel deep learning model predictive control framework that exploits low-rank features of the flow in order to achieve considerable improvements to control performance. Instead of predicting the entire fluid state, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to accurately predict the control relevant quantities of the system, which are then embedded into an MPC framework to construct a feedback loop. In order to lower the data requirements and to improve the prediction accuracy and thus the control performance, incoming sensor data are used to update the RNN online. The results are validated using varying fluid flow examples of increasing complexity.},

    author={Bhandari, Sabin},
    year={2021},
    school={Technical University of Munich},
    abstract={Landing a spacecraft is a challenging task as there are different external (environment) and internal (measurements) factors that play an essential role in precisely landing the ship in the target with small error margins. Even though the task is difficult, the success of such projects can lead to large cost reductions through energy and resource efficiency. Model Predictive Control can help to achieve the task but requires reasonably accurate models of the real spacecraft. The task is non-trivial as the dynamics of the spacecraft are nonlinear and uncertain, which leads to difficulty in constructing models. Different Machine Learning techniques could be used to build such models, however, this results in a nonlinear complex representation that is difficult to understand. The processes and outcomes of such models are difficult to interpret, and they usually function as a ”black box” mapping of input and output. Thus, the main idea of this thesis is to use the {K}oopman operator to model the nonlinear dynamics of the spacecraft into a higher dimensional lifted feature space where its evolution is linearly represented. The linear operators built on the {K}oopman operator framework are simple, data-driven, and used to design controllers, in our case linear Model Predictive Control without any nonlinear optimization schemes. Furthermore, we explore how the predictors obtained through this method are comparatively superior in terms of performance to the existing linear predictors. When used in a Model Predictive Control scheme, the model is efficient, allowing for quick control loop optimization. As a result of the effective linear model controlling techniques, it is suitable for real-time systems. Landing a spaceship has many requirements that are similar to the stabilization of an inverted pendulum: the spaceship is controlled from below through the thrusters, which act as the cart in the pendulum. The process of building predictors and applying Model Predictive Control is similar. That is why a pendulum system is used as an illustrative example in this study. },

Our method assumes no a priori knowledge of the system dynamics. Instead, both the dynamics and information about the user’s interaction are learned from observation through the use of a {K}oopman operator. Using the learned model, we define an optimization problem to compute the autonomous partner’s control policy. Finally, we dynamically allocate control authority to each partner based on a comparison of the user input and the autonomously generated control. We refer to this idea as model-based shared control (MbSC). We evaluate the efficacy of our approach with two human subjects studies consisting of 32 total participants (16 subjects in each study). The first study imposes a linear constraint on the modeling and autonomous policy generation algorithms. The second study explores the more general, nonlinear variant. Overall, we find that MbSC significantly improves task and control metrics when compared with a natural learning, or user only, control paradigm. Our experiments suggest that models learned via the {K}oopman operator generalize across users, indicating that it is not necessary to collect data from each individual user before providing assistance with MbSC. We also demonstrate the data efficiency of MbSC and, consequently, its usefulness in online learning paradigms. Finally, we find that the nonlinear variant has a greater impact on a user’s ability to successfully achieve a defined task than the linear variant.},

Using this approach, autonomous control of a pneumatically actuated soft continuum manipulator is achieved. In several trajectory following experiments, this controller is shown to be more accurate and precise than controllers based on models that do not explicitly account for loading.

  title={On Flexible Tubes Conveying a Moving Fluid: Variational Dynamics and Spectral Analysis},
  author={Canham, Mitchell H},
  year={2017},
  school={University of Alberta},
  abstract={This study focuses on the motion of a hollow flexible tube conveying a flowing fluid, also known as the garden-hose instability. This system becomes unstable when the fluid moving through the pipe exceeds a critical flow rate. This non-linear dynamical system involves complex fluid-structure interactions. As the fluid travels down the pipe it can cause deformations to the pipe structure, which consequently changes the flow dynamics. Research into this system began with the work of Ashley and Haviland (1950), who were attempting to explain vibrations which show up in pipelines. It has since garnered considerable interest in scientific literature as it has numerous practical applications. It can be used to model biomechanical systems such as blood flow through arteries or airflow through alveoli in the lungs. It also has applications to aerospace designs as early stage rocket engines require rapid transfer of enormous quantities of fuel through relatively thin and lightweight pipes. My research involves creating a simple model of a hollow tube conveying a fluid and investigating the ordinary differential equations that get produced. This model uses a geometrically exact theory that takes into consideration a tube that has a variable cross section in space and time. This theory is derived in a Lagrangian variational framework. I will also present a physical experiment I created of a flexible tube conveying water. Data is collected from the experiment using a stereoscopic camera set up and a centerline detection algorithm. I suggest a means to analyze this type of data using a {K}oopman operator, which has never been previously used to investigate the dynamics of the garden hose instability.},

    abstract={Interest in soft robotics has increased in recent years due to their potential in a myriad of applications. A wide variety of soft robots has emerged, including bio-inspired robotic swimmers such as jellyfish, rays, and robotic fish. However, the highly nonlinear fluid-structure interactions pose considerable challenges in the analysis, modeling, and feedback control of these soft robotic swimmers. In particular, developing models that are of high fidelity but are also amenable to control for such robots remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach that exploits {K}oopman operators to obtain a linear representation of the soft swimmer dynamics. Specifically, two methodologies are explored for obtaining the basis functions of the the operator, one based on data-based derivatives estimated using high-gain observers, and the other based on the dynamics structure of a tail-actuated rigid-body robotic fish. The resulting approximate finite-dimensional operators are trained and evaluated using data from high-fidelity CFD simulations that incorporate fluid-structure interactions. Validation results demonstrate that, while both methods are promising in producing control-oriented models, the approach based on derivative estimates shows higher accuracy in state prediction.},

However, implementing optimal automatic operation control is challenging due to the train's uncertain dynamics and actuator saturation. To address this issue, this paper develops a data-driven {K}oopman model based predictive control method for automatic train operation systems. The proposed control scheme is designed within a data-driven framework. First, using operational data of trains and the {K}oopman operator, an explicit linear {K}oopman model is built to characterize the train dynamics. Then, a model predictive controller is designed based on the {K}oopman model under comfort and actuator constraints. Furthermore, an online update mechanism for the {K}oopman model is developed to cope with the changing dynamic characteristics of trains, which reduces the accumulation errors and improves control performance. Stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is provided. Comparative simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.},

An attitude control synthesis method is developed on the basis of the linear optimal control algorithm for the reduced linear system. The proposed controller design method is compared with some classical nonlinear optimal controllers to show its advantages. Also, the leaderless attitude synchronization problem is solved with the help of the reduced linear system and the well-studied linear multiagent system theory. Furthermore, a possible solution to the case with a high angular velocity is provided. Simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the theory.},

The basic idea is to transform the state space of a nonlinear system (a car in our case) to a higher-dimensional space, using so-called basis functions, where the system dynamics is linear. The selection of basis functions is crucial and there is no general approach on how to select them, this paper gives some discussion on this topic. Two distinct approaches for selecting the basis functions are presented. The first approach, based on Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition, relies heavily on expert basis selection and is completely data-driven. The second approach utilizes the knowledge of the nonlinear dynamics, which is used to construct eigenfunctions of the {K}oopman operator which are known by definition to evolve linearly along the nonlinear system trajectory. The eigenfunctions are then used as basis functions for prediction. Each approach is presented with a numerical example and discussion on the feasibility of the approach for a nonlinear vehicle system.},

The vehicle system typically features a lot of nonlinearities such as rigid-body dynamics, coordinate system transformations and most importantly the tire. These nonlinearities are approximated in a predefined subset of the state-space by the linear {K}oopman operator and used for a linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) design in the high-dimension state space where the nonlinear system dynamics evolve linearly. The result is a nonlinear MPC designed by linear methodologies. It is demonstrated that the {K}oopman-based controller is able to recover from a very unusual state of the vehicle where all the aforementioned nonlinearities are dominant. The controller is compared with a controller based on a classic local linearization and shortcomings of this approach are discussed.},

The method is based on the {K}oopman operator approach to nonlinear dynamical systems analysis, which models the flow of observables in a function space, rather than a flow in a state space. Practically, this method estimates a nonlinear diffeomorphism that lifts the dynamics to a higher dimensional space where they are linear. Efficient Model Predictive Control methods can then be applied to the lifted model. This approach allows for real time implementation in on-board hardware, with rigorous incorporation of both input and state constraints during learning. We demonstrate the method in a real-time implementation of fast multirotor landing, where the nonlinear ground effect is learned and used to improve landing speed and quality.},

A backup strategy employs an implicit control invariant set computed by forward integrating the system dynamics. However, this integration is prohibitively expensive for high dimensional systems, and inaccurate in the presence of unmodelled dynamics. We propose to learn discrete-time {K}oopman operators of the closed-loop dynamics under a backup strategy. This approach replaces forward integration by a simple matrix multiplication, which can mostly be computed offline. We also derive an error bound on the unmodeled dynamics in order to robustify the CBF controller.

However, common methods to construct {K}oopman representations seek to learn lifted linear models that cannot capture nonlinear actuation effects inherent in many robotic systems. This paper presents a learning and control methodology that is a first step towards overcoming this limitation. Using the {K}oopman canonical transform, control-affine dynamics can be expressed by a lifted bilinear model. The learned model is used for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) design where the bilinear structure can be exploited to improve computational efficiency. The benefits for control-affine dynamics compared to existing {K}oopman-based methods are highlighted through an example of a simulated planar quadrotor. Prediction error is greatly reduced and closed loop performance similar to NMPC with full model knowledge is achieved.},

One key challenge is to identify the system dynamics that is non-linear with a large dimensional state. To obviate this issue, in this article we propose to train an autoencoder whose encoder and decoder are split and stored at a state sensor and its remote observer, respectively. This autoencoder not only decreases the remote monitoring payload size by reducing the state representation dimension but also learns the system dynamics by lifting it via a {K}oopman operator, thereby allowing the observer to locally predict future states after training convergence. Numerical results under a non-linear cart-pole environment demonstrate that the proposed split learning of a {K}oopman autoencoder can locally predict future states, and the prediction accuracy increases with the representation dimension and transmission power.},

This paper proposes a novel data-driven model-based shared control strategy which is capable of considering drivers’ adaptive behaviors in driver-automation interaction to improve safety. The {K}oopman operator theory, which is a pure data-driven modeling technology, is adopted to yield an explicit control-oriented driver-vehicle model for shared controller design. Besides, a weighted online extended dynamic mode decomposition (WOEDMD) algorithm is proposed to update the {K}oopman driver model online for better capturing the driver’s adaptive behavior in driver-automation interaction, which settles the problem of driver’s potential behavior mechanism variations in practice. Based on the {K}oopman driver-vehicle model, a model-based shared controller is proposed in the model predictive control (MPC) framework, and the potential fields are incorporated in the optimization objectives to ensure safety. A group of human-in-the-loop experiments are conducted on a driving simulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modeling and shared control methods. The results show that the {K}oopman operator theory can be exploited for modeling the dynamics of the driver-vehicle integrated system, and the drivers’ adaptive behavior can be captured by the WOEDMD algorithm. Moreover, the shared controller considering the driver’s adaptive behavior improves the driving safety in the collision avoidance task.},

This work considers the application of motion primitives to path planning and obstacle avoidance problems in which the system is subject to significant parametric and/or initial condition uncertainty. In problems involving parametric uncertainty, optimal path planning is achieved by minimizing the expected value ofacost function subject to probabilistic (chance) constraints on vehicle-obstacle collisions. The {K}oopman operator provides an efficient means to compute expected values for systems under parametric uncertainty. In the context of motion planning, these include both the expected cost function and chance constraints. This work describes a maneuverbased planning method that leverages the {K}oopman operator to minimize an expected cost while satisfying user-imposed risk tolerances. The developed method is illustrated in two separate examples using a Dubins car model subject to parametric uncertainty in its dynamics or environment. Prediction of constraint violation probability is compared with a Monte Carlo method to demonstrate the advantages of the {K}oopman-based calculation.},

The resulting model is linear and hence amenable to control via a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Using our test bed device, a dynamic, lightweight pneumatic fabric arm with an inertial mass at the tip, we show that the combination of HDMD and LQR allows us to command our robot to achieve arbitrary poses using only open loop control. We further show that {K}oopman spectral analysis gives us a dimensionally reduced basis of modes which decreases computational complexity without sacrificing predictive power.},

Using typical physics-based white box models, a trade-off between model complexity (i.e. accuracy) and computational burden has to be made. This is a challenging task with a lot of constraints, since the model order is directly linked to the number of system states. Even though white-box models show suitable performance in most cases, parasitic real-world effects often cannot be modeled satisfactorily with an expedient computational load. Hence, a {K}oopman operator-based model reduction technique is presented which directly links the control action to the system's outputs in a black-box fashion. The {K}oopman operator is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator describing the dynamics of observables of nonlinear autonomous dynamical systems which can be nicely applied to the switching principle of power electronic devices. Following this data-driven approach, the model order and the number of system states are decoupled which allows us to consider more complex systems. Extensive experimental tests with an automotive-type permanent magnet synchronous motor fed by an IGBT 2-level inverter prove the feasibility of the proposed modeling technique in a finite-set model predictive control application.},

High-speed broadband chemiluminescence images, particle image velocimetry (PIV), and dynamic pressure measurements were used to characterize the combustion process. A parametric survey was performed with variations of reactant mass flux (50–500 $kg/(m^2s)$, inlet air temperature (520–710 K), equivalence ratio (0.6–1.7), and degree of oxygen enrichment of the oxidizer stream (23.2–33.5\% oxygen mass fraction). Robust detonative behavior was observed over a range of parameters with highest pressure fluctuation amplitudes $(P`/P_c \sim 2-2.65)$ observed with oxygen enrichment of 26–32\% and mass flux of 300–400 $kg/(m^2s)$. A detailed discussion of two representative cases is presented: one operating with a single rotating wave and another with two corotating waves. In both cases, a minor wave was also detected, which circumscribed the annulus in the reverse direction of the major wave(s). PIV was performed at 100 kHz immediately downstream of the combustor exit. These measurements indicate predominantly axial flow from the exit nozzle, with strong velocity fluctuations corresponding to the detonation precession. Singular spectrum analysis revealed that fluctuations in the axial and azimuthal velocity components remained in-phase, with frequency content that matches the chemiluminescence and pressure signals.},

    abstract={The need to deliver well-informed decisions within stringent production cycles in unconventional plays is motivating the quest for practical models that can assimilate increasing volumes of data and satisfactorily account for observed production trends. The present work introduces the extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) as a suitable data-driven framework for learning the reservoir dynamics entailed by flow/fracture interactions in unconventional shales. The proposed EDMD approach builds on the approximation of infinite dimensional linear operators combined with the power of deep learning autoencoder networks to extract salient transient features from pressure/stress fields and bulks of production data. The data-driven model is demonstrated on three illustrative examples involving single and two-phase coupled flow/geomechanics simulations and a real production dataset from Vaca Muerta unconventional shale formation in Argentina. Given relatively moderate data requirements, we show that it is possible to attain a high level of predictability from hidden field state variables and well production data. As the main conclusion of this work, EDMD stands as a promising data- driven choice for efficiently reconstructing flow/fracture dynamics that are either partially or entirely unknown, or that are too complex to formulate using known simulation tools on unconventional plays.},

    abstract={Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been performed on a finite-size hemisphere-cylinder model at angle of attack $AoA = 20^\circ$ and Reynolds numbers Re = 350 and 1000. Under these conditions, massive separation exists on the nose and lee-side of the cylinder, and at both Reynolds numbers the flow is found to be unsteady. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) are employed in order to study the primary instability that triggers unsteadiness at $Re = 350$. The dominant coherent flow structures identified at the lower Reynolds number are also found to exist at $Re = 1000$; the question is then posed whether the flow oscillations and structures found at the two Reynolds numbers are related. POD and DMD computations are performed using different subdomains of the DNS computational domain. Besides reducing the computational cost of the analyses, this also permits to isolate spatially localized oscillatory structures from other, more energetic structures present in the flow. It is found that POD and DMD are in general sensitive to domain truncation and non-educated choices of the subdomain may lead to inconsistent results. Analyses at $Re = 350$ show that the primary instability is related to the counter-rotating vortex pair conforming the three-dimensional afterbody wake, and characterized by the frequency $S_t \approx 0.11$, in line with results in the literature. At $Re = 1000$, vortex-shedding is present in the wake with an associated broadband spectrum centered around the same frequency. The horn/leeward vortices at the cylinder lee-side, upstream of the cylinder base, also present finite amplitude oscillations at the higher Reynolds number. The spatial structure of these oscillations, described by the POD modes, is easily differentiated from that of the wake oscillations. Additionally, the frequency spectra associated with the lee-side vortices presents well-defined peaks, corresponding to $S_t \approx 0.11$ and its few harmonics, as opposed to the broadband spectrum found at the wake.},

    abstract={Liquid injection systems and subsequent atomization behaviors are vital in many power generation and propulsion systems. These systems are inherently complex, owing to coupling of nonlinear processes in turbulent, multiphase flows. As a result, understanding and predicting the dynamical behaviors is inhibited through traditional system analysis which greatly impacts the ability to predict future states or control the nonlinear flow. {K}oopman analysis has emerged as a data-driven approach in extracting dynamical features and physical understanding of nonlinear flows through a modal decomposition. This dissertation investigates such {K}oopman analysis techniques to improve the understanding of atomization systems, with an emphasis on generating compact and interpretable representations. Commonplace techniques of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) are applied and evaluated on canonical atomization systems, highlighting their respective strengths and disadvantages as a means to perform a modal decomposition. Although POD and DMD have seen widespread use, they are inherently limited in capturing underlying dynamical processes of nonlinear data, which is demonstrated and verified on a hierarchy of system complexity. To overcome the limitations of POD and DMD, a deep learning-based extension of {K}oopman analysis, in the form of a deep convolutional {K}oopman network (CKN), is proposed for extracting dynamical features of spatio-temporal atomization data.

    abstract={Describing and forecasting city traffic is challenging, given the array of factors influencing the movement of pedestrians and vehicles. Faced with this complexity, research has focused on machine learning as a way to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns, based on past sensor data. While the methods can accurately forecast high-dimensional observations, it is often hard to explain the models and their predictions. In many cases, only the predictive performance of an otherwise black box model is evaluated. An accurate but explainable alternative is provided by the {K}oopman operator, an emerging methodology for data-driven identification of high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamical systems. In this study, we showcase the method by analyzing pedestrian traffic data from Melbourne, Australia. We formulate our computations in the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition framework, where we approximate the {K}oopman operator in a function basis computed with time delay embedding and the Diffusion Map algorithm. The model captures the distinct temporal patterns of 11 traffic sensors simultaneously. Because the dynamics become linear in the operator-theoretic perspective, we can decompose the model into its spectral components. Importantly, these components facilitate interpretation and can increase scientific understanding of the underlying system and the model’s operations. For the Melbourne data, we show that the spectral components connect to the underlying state space geometry and indicate the model’s stability over a prediction horizon. Our study showcases how the {K}oopman operator framework offers explainable and accurate data-driven predictions in a real-world traffic system. The results can easily be transferred to other traffic systems.},

While significant uncertainty usually exists in airdrop scenarios, current mission planning algorithms use only nominal parameters to compute a deterministic solution. This paper introduces an optimal control algorithm in which the {K}oopman operator is used to solve for the probabilistically optimal input in the presence of parametric uncertainty. The proposed approach offers unique computational advantages over alternative uncertainty quantification techniques, providing a practical method to compute a probabilistically optimal input. In the context of the airdrop problem, these inputs are the optimal package release point and aircraft run-in. Given an objective function defined over the drop zone and a joint probability density accounting for uncertainty in the system parameters, the objective function is pulled back to the drop altitude using the {K}oopman operator, and an expected value is computed with the joint probability density. The optimal release point and run-in is then selected to optimize this expected value. Following a general description of the {K}oopman operator approach to probabilistic decision making, the airdrop-specific implementation is described. Simulation examples are presented, highlighting the performance of the algorithm in real-world scenarios. Results compare favorably with those achieved through deterministic methods.},

    abstract={In this paper, a deep learning method using {K}oopman operator is presented for modeling nonlinear multiscale dynamical problems. {K}oopman operator is able to transform a non-linear dynamical system into a linear system in a {K}oopman invariant subspace. However, it is usually very challenging to choose a set of suitable observation functions spanning the {K}oopman invariant subspace when only data is available for the model. It is practically important for us to predict the evolution of the state of the dynamical system from the {K}oopman invariant subspace. To this end, we introduce a reconstruction operator that maps the observation function space to the model's state space. Incorporating measurement data, a set of neural networks are constructed to learn the {K}oopman invariant subspace and the reconstruction operator. The loss function not only considers the properties of {K}oopman invariant subspace, but also reflects the prediction of future state, which makes the proposed method can realize the prediction of future state for a relatively long time. It may be experimentally expensive to collect the fine-scale data. It will be challenging to use limited computational resources to generate sufficient fine-scale data for neural network training. To overcome this difficulty, we use the data in a coarse-scale and learn effective coarse models for the nonlinear multiscale dynamical problems. In order to make the learned coarse model effectively capture fine-scale information, the loss functions for the neural networks are constructed using a set of multiscale basis functions, which are assumed to be given as a prior. In this case, an accurate fine-scale model can be derived by downscaling the learned coarse model. The deep learning multiscale models using {K}oopman operator can achieve a relatively long-time prediction for the evolution of the state of the nonlinear multiscale dynamical problems. A few numerical examples are presented to show that the effectiveness of learning multiscale models and the long-time prediction.

Secondly, we present a method for modeling traffic dynamics with signal phases included as exogenous input. Given an unusually congested condition, the analysis is consistent in that longer green times for the affected leg result in less severe congestion and vice versa for shorter green times. This shows promise for anticipating queue behavior under modified traffic signal phase sequences.

Next, we propose using the oscillatory modes of the {K}oopman operator, approximated with DMD, for early identification of unstable queue growth that has the potential to cause cascading congestion. Then we demonstrate how DMD can be coupled with knowledge of the traffic signal control status to determine traffic signal control parameters that are able to reduce queue lengths.

Intermittent oscillations commonly occur in the transition process wherein chaotic states alternate with limit cycle oscillations and both the chaotic state and the limit cycle oscillation last with no fixed period. Intermittent oscillations that occur in the thermoacoustic system are demonstrated to be deterministic. A {K}oopman linearization procedure is implemented to model the intermittent combustion oscillations in the backward-facing step combustor. The nonlinear dynamics of intermittent combustion oscillations are approximated as a forced linear system in an orthogonal space, which is constructed by singular value decomposition of a delay coordinates matrix. The phase space of an intermittent combustion oscillation can be divided into linear and nonlinear regions by the magnitude of the nonlinear term in the forced linear system. As a result, intermittent combustion oscillations can be described as the transition between chaotic states and limit cycle oscillations, and the transition occurs when the nonlinear term is large.},

Using higher order derivatives of general nonlinear dynamics that need not be known, we construct a {K}oopman-operator-based linear representation and utilize Taylor series accuracy analysis to derive an error bound. The resulting error formula is used to choose the order of derivatives in the basis functions and obtain a data-driven {K}oopman model using a closed-form expression that can be computed in real time. Using the inverted pendulum system, we illustrate the robustness of the error bounds given noisy measurements of unknown dynamics, where the derivatives are estimated numerically. When combined with control, the {K}oopman representation of the nonlinear system has marginally better performance than competing nonlinear modeling methods, such as SINDy and NARX. In addition, as a linear model, the {K}oopman approach lends itself readily to efficient control design tools, such as linear-quadratic regulator, whereas the other modeling approaches require nonlinear control methods. The efficacy of the approach is further demonstrated with simulation and experimental results on the control of a tail-actuated robotic fish. Experimental results show that the proposed data-driven control approach outperforms a tuned proportional-integral-derivative controller and that updating the data-driven model online significantly improves performance in the presence of unmodeled fluid disturbance.

    abstract={Super-knock is a phenomenon triggered by pre-ignition and has limited the design envelope of internal combustion engines (ICEs) in terms of power density. This poses a huge challenge for the automotive industry where engine sizes have been continuously decreasing due to the demand for weight savings and integration with electrified powertrains. Such downsized engines typically require increased boost pressure, availing conditions conducive to pre-ignition, which in turn may trigger super-knock. Traditionally, this and other forms of knock have been managed by way of a “detection and mitigation” approach in place of “perdition and avoidance” due to an evolving understanding of corresponding combustion dynamics, as well as the incapability of emerging real-time computational methods to perform and actuate over the timescale required. In this study, a data-driven algorithm is used to extract (and adapt) a globally linearized system representation using eigen-time-series, isolating the dynamic modes of the system to capture underlying effects leading to pre-ignition without the need for physics-based modeling. This approach is a unique application of the “Hankel Alternative View of {K}oopman” (HAVOK) analysis for chaotic systems and can be executed on board an engine control module supplying a buffer of recent to latest time-step data to predict an impending pre-ignition event. The proposed design does not require any change to existing sensors and actuators in the existing knock management system architecture, nor would it require any significant increase in computational capacity in terms of the associated engine control unit. A simulation was conducted with real super-knock data to nominally test the applicability of the algorithm. From this training dataset, the linearized dynamic system was able to predict pre-ignition approximately 2.27 s prior to the event, which is adequate to take mitigating action. Further validation runs covering low, medium, and high engine speeds within the envelope of low-speed pre-ignition (LSPI) generated similar results. DOI: https://doi.org/10.4271/03-16-03-0021},

    abstract={Dynamical systems in nature are generally nonlinear and usually contains many hidden dynamics. Therefore, the need for data-driven model discovery and control methods continues. The most popular of these methods is neural networks-based methods nowadays. However, excessive data requirements, long training times and most importantly lack of interpretability of results are the main problems in neural networks-based system identification methods. Among the many other methods used for model discovery, SINDY (Sparce Identification of Non-linear Dynamical Systems) has recently attracted great attention with its simple and effective nature. SINDY, which has many extensions, also has various open problems. The proposed extension in this study is called SINDY-SAIC and combines the methods from Stepwise Sparse Regression (SSR) and Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) model selection algorithm. The need for tuning threshold parameter in SINDY is relaxed using SSR and the robustness to noisy measurements is increased with a newly used state derivative calculation method in sparse regression. In addition, presence of model selection with AIC enables sparse solution by penalizing the number of terms and prevents the algorithm to converge collinear basis. Studied dynamical systems are controlled by Model Predictive Control using discovered models. MPC is a control method that uses prediction models mostly discovered from data and try to minimize a given cost function subjected to the constraints. Both linear and nonlinear prediction models are generated using SINDYSAIC and used in MPC as prediction models. The traditional state feedback (SF) controller is also presented for comparison. The proposed SINDY-SAIC algorithm and the controllers (MPC and SF) are tested for linear and highly non-linear longitudinal missile dynamics under moderate and high level of noise conditions.},

    abstract={Uncertainty propagation is an important step in the derivation of optimal control strategies for dynamic systems in the presence of state and parameter uncertainty. Many stochastic control formulations seek to optimize an expected value of a score or cost function, or otherwise enforce a probabilistic constraint through the use of an expected value. The time-varying state density needed for this expected value computation may be quantified through Monte Carlo methods or explicit approaches such as the Frobenius-Perron operator. This paper explores an alternative approach to the computation of the expected value by leveraging the adjoint relationship between the Frobenius-Perron operator and the {K}oopman operator. This relationship states that the expected value of a forward-propagated density with a score function is equivalent to the expected value of the initial density with the score function mapped back to the initial state space. By computing the expected value through use of the {K}oopman operator, several computational issues arising when using the Frobenius-Perron operator can be mitigated, while maintaining the benefits of an explicit method over Monte Carlo. A general stochastic optimal control problem is formulated wherein the expected value is computed between the initial state density and a score function using the {K}oopman operator. The computational benefits of computing the expected value through use of the {K}oopman operator are discussed, particularly with respect to numerical issues encountered using explicit forward propagation of the state probability density. A series of numerical examples highlight these computational advantages and illustrate the benefit of using this adjoint approach in solution to a range of optimal control problems in the presence of uncertainty.},

    abstract={Probabilistic inverse problems arise in a variety of scientific and engineering applications. A particular type of probabilistic inverse problem, termed a generalized aggregate data inverse problem, involves the specification of expected value targets and/or probabilistic constraints at discrete times or in a discrete set of transformed domains. Because the transformed distributions themselves are not specified, these problems cannot be readily solved by typical Bayesian solution techniques. In this work, a novel solution technique using the {K}oopman operator is proposed. The {K}oopman operator is used to “pull-back” the cost and constraint functions acting on the transformed probability densities to the initial domain, forming a set of integral equations and integral inequalities over a common integration domain. A quadrature technique is employed to approximate this system of equations and inequalities, leading to the formulation of a linearly-constrained convex quadratic program that can be solved using a variety of well-known techniques. Results show that the method can be feasibly applied to solve several practical engineering problems of interest, illustrating tradeoffs in various aspects of the solution process.},

    abstract={This paper presents a novel suboptimal attitude tracking controller based on the algebraic Riccati equation for a near-space hypersonic vehicle (NSHV). Since the NSHV’s attitude dynamics is complexly nonlinear, it is hard to directly construct an appropriate algebraic Riccati equation. We design the construction based on the Chebyshev series and the {K}oopman operator theory, which includes three steps. First, the Chebyshev series are considered to transform the error dynamics of the NSHV’s attitude into a polynomial system. Second, the {K}oopman operator is used to obtain a series of high-dimensional linear dynamics to approximate each of the polynomial system’s vector fields. In this step, our contribution is to determine a well-posed linear dynamics with the minimal dimension to approximate the original nonlinear vector field, which helps to design the control law and analyze the control performance. Third, based on the high-dimensional dynamics, the NSHV’s attitude error dynamics is separated into the linear part and the nonlinear part, such that the algebraic Riccati equation can be constructed according to the linear part. Then, the suboptimal error feedback control law is derived from the algebraic Riccati equation. The closed-loop control system is proved to be locally exponentially stable. Finally, the numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the suboptimal control law.},

    abstract={This work explores the application of the recently developed {K}oopman operator approach for model identification and feedback control of a hydraulic fracturing process. Controlling fracture propagation and proppant transport with precision is a challenge due in large part to the difficulty of constructing approximate models that accurately capture the characteristic moving boundary and highly-coupled dynamics exhibited by the process. {K}oopman operator theory is particularly attractive here as it offers a way to explicitly construct linear representations for even highly nonlinear dynamics. The method is data-driven and relies on lifting the states to an infinite-dimensional space of functions called observables where the dynamics are governed by a linear {K}oopman operator. This work considers two problems: (a) fracture geometry control, and (b) proppant concentration control. In both cases, an approximate linear model of the corresponding dynamics is constructed and used to design a model predictive controller (MPC). The manuscript shows that in the case of highly nonlinear dynamics, as observed in the proppant concentration, use of canonical functions in the observable basis fails. In such cases, a priori system knowledge can be leveraged to choose the required basis. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the {K}oopman linear model shows excellent agreement with the real system and successfully achieves the desired target values maximizing the oil and gas productivity. Additionally, due to its linear structure, the {K}oopman models allow convex MPC formulations that avoid any issues associated with nonlinear optimization.},

    author={Narasingam, Abhinav},

    abstract={Many chemical processes are characterized by nonlinear models with moving boundaries that describe their dynamics. Such a nonlinear trajectory can explore many regions of the state space and the spatial domains of interest as well as the dominant spatial patterns of the system change with time. Therefore, traditional model approximation methods may fail to accurately capture the dynamics. This underlines the need to develop strategies for obtaining computationally efficient yet highly accurate models that aid in the prediction and control of these systems. In such systems, care should be taken to capture the local behavior of every portion of the solution trajectory in the state space. To achieve this, the first step of this research work computes (temporally) local reduced order models by first performing time-domain partitioning using a novel clustering strategy based on Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming. The reduced bases are then derived within each cluster using two model reduction methods, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The proposed framework is tested on a nonlinear hydraulic fracturing process, and a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is formulated using the (temporally) local reduced order models to design an optimum pumping schedule that ensures uniform proppant concentration for maximum oil and gas extraction. The idea of model reduction is then extended to the parameter space in order to estimate unknown rock properties that directly affect the hydraulic fracturing process. Owing to the complex dynamics exhibited, this results in the formulation of a large- scale inverse problem that is ill-posed. To deal with this unidentifiability issue, the number of unknown model parameters are reduced while preserving the spatial features in the geological properties via POD. The statistical information is then updated using the available process measurements via a Monte Carlo data assimilation technique, the Ensemble Kalman Filter. Although the local model reduction framework is superior in performance, a single model that is accurate within a larger domain in the state space would be beneficial in some cases. Therefore, the next part explores an alternative approach that uses {K}oopman operator theory to develop linear predictors to approximate nonlinear systems. Before employing it to process systems, we address several key challenges associated with it. In particular, we solve a sparse regression problem over a large set of candidate functional forms to effectively identify the required nonlinear transformation (observable functions). The developed models are shown to reveal important physical phenomena such as proppant transport and fracture propagation inside a fracture. It also highlights how a priori knowledge can be incorporated easily into the algorithm and results in accurate models that are used for controller synthesis. Finally, {K}oopman theory is integrated with Lyapunov-based MPC (LMPC) for stabilizing nonlinear systems. LMPC possesses all the advantages of a standard MPC with added explicit Lyapunov constraints and is particularly suited as it explicitly characterizes a set of initial conditions starting from where the closed–loop stability can be guaranteed. By leveraging the linear structure of the {K}oopman models, control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) within LMPC are embedded in the nonlinear transformation to yield a standard convex (quadratic) optimization problem. This method is then improved by formulating the controller in {K}oopman eigenfunction coordinates, which leads to a bilinear model for control affine systems. Provided there exists a continuously differentiable inverse mapping between the original state space and (lifted) function space, the designed controller is capable of translating the feedback stabilizability of the {K}oopman bilinear system to the original nonlinear system. Due to the bilinear structure of the {K}oopman model, seeking a CLF is no longer a bottleneck for LMPC. Benchmark numerical examples demonstrate the utility of the proposed feedback control design.},

  abstract={Accurate and efficient models of physical processes like fluid flows are crucial for applications ranging from forecasting the weather to controlling autonomous aircraft and suppressing combustion instar bilities in liquid fueled rocket engines. These models allow us to predict what the system will do — oftentimes in response to an input or design characteristics that we would like to choose intelligently — as well as to detect what the real system is doing from limited and costly sensor measurements. The main challenge is that the equations governing complex systems like fluid flows that we might derive from first principles are routinely nonlinear and involve too many variables to be simulated by a computer or sensed in real time. Therefore, we aim to construct and leverage simplified models of these complex systems that capture the most important aspects of its behavior for the task at hand, while relying on a much smaller number of variables that can be simulated or sensed in real time. While highly effective and well-studied techniques exist when the system is linear, in many important cases the system is operating too far away from an equilibrium state to employ linearization or other linear approximation techniques. In this thesis, we make use of data collected from the underlying complex system or simulations performed ahead of time in order to identify patterns and construct simplified models based on them. In order to build simplified predictive models, we present a variety of techniques based on projecting the governing equations onto manifolds identified from data. Such manifolds must be nonlinear in order to find models involving the smallest number of variables. We also find that in order to build models of systems with selective sensitivity, such as shear-driven fluid flows, it is important to incorporate information from the linearized adjoint of the governing equations. We also describe an alternative viewpoint for modeling based on converting nonlinear dynamics into linear dynamics in a function space via data-driven approximation of {K}oopman operators. Finally, we present a constellation of data-driven techniques enabling us to find minimal sets of sensors or measurements to robustly infer what a highly nonlinear system is doing.},

  author={Pan, Shaowu},

  school={University of Michigan},
  abstract={Non-linear dynamical systems are of significant interest to a wide range of science and engineering communities. This dissertation is focused on the advancement of theory and algorithms for operator-theoretic modeling and decomposition of non-linear dynamical systems, with a particular emphasis on the {K}oopman operator. The {K}oopman operator represents non-linear dynamics in the form of an infinite-dimensional linear operator over the space of observables of the system state. Despite the broad appeal of the {K}oopman operator in modal analysis, reduced-order modeling and control, discovering accurate finite-dimensional representations presents considerable challenges. Most of the existing data-driven approaches for non-linear systems target prediction, which in effect amounts to interpolation within parameter space. In contrast, the {K}oopman operator presents the potential of a systematic framework for physics-consistent, stable predictions, control and modal analysis. Data-driven methods including time delay dynamic mode decomposition (TD-DMD), extended DMD (EDMD), kernel DMD (KDMD), and deep learning-based techniques have been developed for {K}oopman approximations. While the promise of these techniques is clear, stability, robustness, spurious modes, and uncertainty quantification continue to be a challenge. As a consequence, the above methods are often employed as qualitative postprocessing tools instead of quantitative, robust, and accurate a posteriori models. This thesis aims to address the above challenges and demonstrates applications in modal decomposition, predictive modeling, and control of non-linear dynamics. We begin by developing theoretical results on the structure of TD-DMD models for non-linear dynamics on an attractor. We demonstrate that the minimal number of time delays required for perfect reconstruction is directly related to the sparsity of the Fourier spectrum of the dynamics. Furthermore, we explain why TD-DMD can “extrapolate in time”, i.e., why a model trained on a partial period of data can perfectly predict the future. We also prove that an increase in the number of time delays benefits numerical conditioning, making the model robust to noisy data. For example, we demonstrate the numerical stabilization effect of “over-delays” on the 3D Turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection. We also construct a ROM based on TD-DMD, and compare it to state-of-the-art methods for a chaotic single injector combustion process. Next, we develop robust and accurate mode selection algorithms for non-linear {K}oopman approximation methods (e.g., EDMD/KDMD). We propose a model-agnostic sparsity promoting framework based on pruning and multi-task learning for {K}oopman eigenfunctions. From an analytical perspective, we show a close relationship between the well-known sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), and an empirical criterion. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated in several unsteady flow cases ranging from strongly transient flows including the cylinder wake and a 3D turbulent ship air-wake. Finally, we propose a probabilistic deep learning framework for the continuous-time {K}oopman operator. We introduce a novel parameterization that guarantees the temporal stability of the {K}oopman operator. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated on several non-linear dynamical systems with varying amounts of training data and noise levels. The proposed framework shows better robustness to noise and improved accuracy compared to the vanilla LSTM model. We reveal that linear reconstruction can be still useful for systems with symmetrical attractors. Lastly, we show an application of our framework on the data-driven optimal control of a simple non-linear dynamical system, and highlight performance benefits over traditional local linearization. },

  abstract={We present Lift \& Learn, a physics-informed method for learning low-dimensional models for large-scale dynamical systems. The method exploits knowledge of a system’s governing equations to identify a coordinate transformation in which the system dynamics have quadratic structure. This transformation is called a lifting map because it often adds auxiliary variables to the system state. The lifting map is applied to data obtained by evaluating a model for the original nonlinear system. This lifted data is projected onto its leading principal components, and low-dimensional linear and quadratic matrix operators are fit to the lifted reduced data using a least-squares operator inference procedure. Analysis of our method shows that the Lift \& Learn models are able to capture the system physics in the lifted coordinates at least as accurately as traditional intrusive model reduction approaches. This preservation of system physics makes the Lift \& Learn models robust to changes in inputs. Numerical experiments on the FitzHugh–Nagumo neuron activation model and the compressible Euler equations demonstrate the generalizability of our model.},

  abstract={This paper presents a methodology that enables projection-based model reduction for black-box high-fidelity models governing nonlinear static parametric systems. The methodology specifically addresses the situation in which the high-fidelity model may be a black box, but there is knowledge of the governing equations in continuous partial differential equation (PDE) form. Drawing from the {K}oopman theory, it first obtains an underdetermined linear representation of the governing equations in terms of a set of observables. Then, the linear operator is extracted by a direct discretization of the linear differential terms using a suitable method, such as the finite volume method. By applying the snapshots of the observables to the discrete linear operator, a right-hand-side vector is obtained, providing the necessary system matrices for the projection step, which is done via proper orthogonal decomposition. The underdetermined linear system is closed with a set of nonlinear algebraic equations that act as constraints, whose computation is efficiently handled via the discrete empirical interpolation method. An offline database of reduced-order models (ROMs) corresponding to each parameter snapshot is generated, which are then interpolated online to predict the state for new parameter instances. The resulting ROM is posed and solved as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. The method is tested on a canonical PDE, followed by the 2-D compressible Euler equations governing the flow past an airfoil, under both the subsonic and transonic regimes. It is demonstrated that the ROM predicts both the state and outputs within 5\% of the full-order model given adequate snapshots and the computational speedup is up to two to three orders of magnitude.},

    abstract={In this paper, we present a novel operator theoretic framework for optimal placement of actuators and sensors in nonlinear systems. The problem is motivated by its application to control of nonequilibrium dynamics in the form of temperature in building systems and control of oil spill in oceanographic flow. The controlled evolution of a passive scalar field, modeling the temperature distribution or density of oil dispersant, is governed by a linear advection partial differential equation (PDE) with spatially located actuators and sensors. Spatial locations of actuators and sensors are optimized to maximize the controllability and observability regions of the linear advection PDE. Linear transfer Perron–Frobenius and {K}oopman operators, associated with the advective velocity field, are used to provide an analytical characterization for the controllable and observable spaces of the advection PDE. Set-oriented numerical methods are proposed for the finite dimensional approximation of the linear transfer operators. The finite dimensional approximation is shown to introduce weaker notion of controllability and observability, referred to as coarse controllability and observability. The finite dimensional approximation is used to formulate the optimization problem for the optimal placement of sensors and actuators. The optimal placement problem is a combinatorial optimization problem. However, the positivity property of the linear transfer operator is exploited to provide an exact solution to the optimal placement problem using greedy algorithm. Application of the framework is demonstrated for the placement of sensors in a building system for the detection of contaminants and for optimal release of dispersant location for control of contaminant in a Double Gyre velocity field. Simulation results reveal interesting connections between the optimal location of actuators and sensors, maximizing the controllability and observability regions respectively, and the coherent structures in the fluid flow.},

By coupling with deep neural networks and the linear quadratic regulator control, we propose the first {K}oopman operator model-based reinforcement learning algorithm called deep {K}oopman reinforcement learning (DKRL).

The space of independent state variables is augmented by adding variables associated with nonlinear elements involved in the bucket-soil dynamics. These include nonlinear resistive forces and moment acting on the bucket from the soil, and the effective inertia of the bucket that varies as the soil is captured into the bucket. Variables associated with these nonlinear resistive and inertia elements are treated as additional state variables, and their time evolution is represented as another set of linear differential equations. The lifted linear dynamic model is then applied to Model Predictive Contouring Control, where a cost functional is minimized as a convex optimization problem thanks to the linear dynamics in the lifted space. The lifted linear model is tuned based on a data-driven method by using a soil dynamics simulator.

They offer a viable option for reusable, efficient, air-breathing hypersonic propulsion and they will be of critical importance to powering the transportation and defense systems of the future. Due to the lack of turbo-machinery in scramjet flow paths, sufficient compression and velocity reduction of the flow must be achieved using the Pre-Combustion Shock Train (PCST), which is a series of shocks in the isolator portion of a scramjet. Under certain conditions, the PCST is ejected out of the front of the engine, causing the engine to unstart. The consequences of unstart are severe, with the engine no longer producing thrust, and potentially causing complete vehicle loss. This work focuses on a high fidelity, computationally generated unstart simulation, in which a pressure induced unstart event is potentially controlled by an upstream cavity. Since such high-fidelity databases are large and difficult to analyze, modal decomposition techniques are often employed. The challenge in applying these techniques for the unstart problem is that it is not stationary i.e., it is unsteady but does not oscillate about a mean position. To address this, two data-driven modal decomposition techniques, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and multi-resolution DMD (mrDMD) are examined by applying them to the streamwise component of the unstarting velocity field. The mrDMD algorithm was first validated on the statistically stationary case of supersonic flow over a wall-mounted turret before it was applied to the unstart problem. Results from the DMD analysis of unstart are compared to those from a 4-level mrDMD analysis, which allows for hierarchical time-frequency analysis. DMD was able to capture some gross flow features of the unstart event, such as final PCST location, top and bottom wall separation, and cavity shear layer oscillations. mrDMD was able to identify all of these features as well, and additionally was able to capture the PCST and separation bubbles in their correct spatio-temporal vicinities as the isolator flow-field evolved over time. DMD, and mrDMD to a lesser extent, exhibited difficulty in capturing the travelling shock waves of the PCST in a physically meaningful manner, which is likely due to the methods being based on the Singular Value Decomposition. It was shown that despite these difficulties in capturing moving waves, mrDMD clearly resolved spatio-temporal coherent structures in the isolator that DMD completely failed to. However, mrDMD may require the snapshots to have finer spatiotemporal resolution, to allow for more than the current 4-level analysis, to truly reveal its benefits, such as detecting and controlling unstart.},

In this paper, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm with a model of the vehicle identified using the {K}oopman operator theory is proposed. The {K}oopman operator is a linear predictor for nonlinear dynamical systems based on the lifting of the nonlinear dynamics in a higher-dimensional space where its evolution is linear. Using such a model may allow for achieving similar performance to those of a nonlinear MPC with the computational efficiency of a linear MPC.

  abstract={The private eVTOL/UAM market is rapidly expanding, with many companies and investors betting on the possibility of low-cost-to-operate and zero emissions air taxis and last-mile-delivery sUAS dominating the skies of cities in the near future. While fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft regularly operate over populated areas, the envisioned orders-of-magnitude increase in air traffic increases the risk to those on the ground and in the air. The risk calculus is also altered by the novel designs of some eVTOL aircraft. Many designs have neither significant autorotation nor low-speed-gliding capability to land safely in the event of catastrophic power failure. Ballistic parachute systems (ballistic recovery systems), such as those found in increasing use on general aviation aircraft and small UAS (drones) provide some risk mitigation, but provide no control over the landing location; the aircraft will land wherever the wind blows it. Aviation safety experts have noted that while ballistic recovery systems improve safety and should be included on all UAM aircraft, there are still hazards from a vehicle descending uncontrolled under a parachute. This paper covers the analysis and design of a guided emergency recovery system, which uses bleed-air control and a gliding steerable parachute. The analysis shows that due to the use of a parachute which provides lift, rather than a pure drag device, and the use of lightweight bleed-air control, the overall weight of a guided recovery system can be lower than an equivalent ballistic recovery system. A key feature for an effective guided recovery system is selection of its landing point. The development of a massively parallel probabilistic evaluation method for selecting landing points which provide the best likelihood of avoiding hazards is shown with examples. Simulations of EGRES in New York City Urban Air Mobility, UAS interstate highway inspection, and UAS nuclear power plant inspection scenarios showed that EGRES increased the likelihood of landing in an acceptable area by 2.3, 1.8, and 2.9 times respectively, compared with a ballistic parachute recovery system. Finally, a preliminary design for a Group 2 UAS is presented, along with size and weight estimates.},

    abstract={A model-based, data-driven control framework is introduced within the context of autonomous driving in this study. We propose a data-driven control algorithm that combines autonomous system identification using model-free learning and robust control using a model-based controller design. We present a full solution framework that is capable to automatically generate optimal path while performing system identification of a vehicle with unknown dynamics. We then design modelbased control which is actively learned from a data-driven approach. Based on our new system identification algorithm, we can approximate an accurate, explainable, and linearized system representation in a high-dimensional latent space, without any prior knowledge of the system. To validate the algorithm, we conduct the model predictive control of an autonomous vehicle based on the augmented system identification on a scaled racing vehicle. The result indicates that we are able to design control in the lifted space to achieve tasks in path control and obstacle avoidance. The automatic path generation combined with the data driven control requires no a-priori knowledge of the vehicle and also proved to be effective that only requires less than 5 laps to design an optimal trajectory while identified a system that is able to achieve minimum lap time without extra learning episodes.},

The effect of model mismatch between original nonlinear dynamics and its trained {K}oopman linear model is handled by using a constraint tightening approach in the proposed tracking MPC strategy. By choosing two Lyapunov candidate functions, we prove that solution is recursively feasible and input-to-state stable to a neighborhood of both online and offline optimal reachable steady outputs in the presence of bounded modeling errors.

    abstract={The {K}oopman operator is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator that governs the evolution of scalar observables defined on the state space of an autonomous dynamical system and is a powerful tool for the analysis and decomposition of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this manuscript, we present a data-driven method for approximating the leading eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes of the {K}oopman operator. The method requires a data set of snapshot pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit governing equations or interaction with a “black box” integrator. We will show that this approach is, in effect, an extension of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which has been used to approximate the {K}oopman eigenvalues and modes. Furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a Markov process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm approximates the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov backward equation, which could be considered as the “stochastic {K}oopman operator” (Mezic in Nonlinear Dynamics 41(1–3): 309–325, 2005). Finally, four illustrative examples are presented: two that highlight the quantitative performance of the method when presented with either deterministic or stochastic data and two that show potential applications of the {K}oopman eigenfunctions.},

    abstract={In recent years, methods for data-driven {K}oopman spectral analysis, such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), have become increasingly popular approaches for extracting dynamically relevant features from data sets. However to establish the connection between techniques like DMD or Extended DMD (EDMD) and the {K}oopman operator, assumptions are made about the nature of the supplied data. In particular, both methods assume the data were generated by an autonomous dynamical system, which can be limiting in certain experimental or computational settings, such as when system actuation is present. We present a modification of EDMD that overcomes this limitation by compensating for the effects of actuation, and is capable of recovering the leading {K}oopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes of the unforced system. To highlight the efficacy of this approach, we apply it to two examples with (quasi)-periodic forcing: the first is the Duffing oscillator, which demonstrates eigenfunction approximation, and the second is a lattice Boltzmann code that approximates the FitzHugh-Nagumo partial differential equation and shows {K}oopman mode and eigenvalue computation.},

    abstract={Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a powerful tool for extracting spatial and temporal patterns from multidimensional time series, and it has been used successfully in a wide range of fields, including fluid mechanics, robotics, and neuroscience. Two of the main challenges remaining in DMD research are noise sensitivity and issues related to Krylov space closure when modeling nonlinear systems. Here, we investigate the combination of noise and nonlinearity in a controlled setting, by studying a class of systems with linear latent dynamics which are observed via multinomial observables. Our numerical models include system and measurement noise. We explore the influences of dataset metrics, the spectrum of the latent dynamics, the normality of the system matrix, and the geometry of the dynamics. Our results show that even for these very mildly nonlinear conditions, DMD methods often fail to recover the spectrum and can have poor predictive ability. Our work is motivated by our experience modeling multilegged robot data, where we have encountered great difficulty in reconstructing time series for oscillatory systems with slow transients, which decay only slightly faster than a period.},

    author={Xiao, Yongqian},
    journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14700},
    year={2021},
    abstract={Autonomous driving has attracted lots of attention in recent years. An accurate vehicle dynamics is important for autonomous driving techniques, e.g. trajectory prediction, motion planning, and control of trajectory tracking. Although previous works have made some results, the strong nonlinearity, precision, and interpretability of dynamics for autonomous vehicles are open problems worth being studied. In this paper, the approach based on the {K}oopman operator named deep direct {K}oopman (DDK) is proposed to identify the model of the autonomous vehicle and the identified model is a linear time-invariant (LTI) version, which is convenient for motion planning and controller design. In the approach, the {K}oopman eigenvalues and system matrix are considered as trainable tensors with the original states of the autonomous vehicle being concatenated to a part of the {K}oopman eigenfunctions so that a physically interpretable subsystem can be extracted from the identified latent dynamics. Subsequently, the process of the identification model is trained under the proposed method based on the dataset which consists of about 60km of data collected with a real electric SUV while the effectiveness of the identified model is validated. Meanwhile, a high-fidelity vehicle dynamics is identified in CarSim with DDK, and then, a linear model predictive control (MPC) called DDK-MPC integrating DDK is designed to validate the performance for the control of trajectory tracking. Simulation results illustrate that the model of the nonlinear vehicle dynamics can be identified effectively via the proposed method and that excellent tracking performance can be obtained with the identified model under DDK-MPC.},

    abstract={With the development of end-to-end control based on deep learning, it is important to study new system modeling techniques to realize dynamics modeling with high-dimensional inputs. In this paper, a novel {K}oopman-based deep convolutional network, called CKNet, is proposed to identify latent dynamics from raw pixels. CKNet learns an encoder and decoder to play the role of the {K}oopman eigenfunctions and modes, respectively. The {K}oopman eigenvalues can be approximated by eigenvalues of the learned state transition matrix. The deterministic convolutional {K}oopman network (DCKNet) and the variational convolutional {K}oopman network (VCKNet) are proposed to span some subspace for approximating the {K}oopman operator respectively. Because CKNet is trained under the constraints of the {K}oopman theory, the identified latent dynamics is in a linear form and has good interpretability. Besides, the state transition and control matrices are trained as trainable tensors so that the identified dynamics is also time-invariant. We also design an auxiliary weight term for reducing multi-step linearity and prediction losses. Experiments were conducted on two offline trained and four online trained nonlinear forced dynamical systems with continuous action spaces in Gym and Mujoco environment respectively, and the results show that identified dynamics are adequate for approximating the latent dynamics and generating clear images. Especially for offline trained cases, this work confirms CKNet from a novel perspective that we visualize the evolutionary processes of the latent states and the {K}oopman eigenfunctions with DCKNet and VCKNet separately to each task based on the same episode and results demonstrate that different approaches learn similar features in shapes.},

    abstract={Autonomous driving technologies have received notable attention in the past decades. In autonomous driving systems, identifying a precise dynamical model for motion control is nontrivial due to the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty in vehicle dynamics. Recent efforts have resorted to machine learning techniques for building vehicle dynamical models, but the generalization ability and interpretability of existing methods still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a pure data-driven vehicle modeling approach based on deep neural networks with an interpretable {K}oopman operator. The main advantage of using the {K}oopman operator is to represent the nonlinear dynamics in a linear lifted feature space. In the proposed approach, a deep learning-based extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm is presented to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of the {K}oopman operator. A multi-step prediction loss function is used in the training process, enabling a long-term prediction capability. Furthermore, a data-driven model predictive controller with the learned {K}oopman model is designed for velocity profile tracking control of autonomous vehicles. Simulation results in a high-fidelity CarSim environment show that our approach outperforms previously developed traditional and advanced modeling methods. Velocity profile tracking tests of the autonomous vehicle are also performed in the CarSim environment. The results show that our approach has better tracking accuracy and higher computational efficiency than the model predictive control algorithms using a nonlinear model and a linear time-varying model.},

However, current linear models based on linear {K}oopman realizations cannot capture the control-affine dynamics in nonlinear systems. This may result in large discrepancies between the original nonlinear system and the data-driven linear model, hindering its use in MPC. To address this gap, first, a novel {K}oopman bilinear vehicle model that takes control-affine dynamics into consideration is constructed and tested in open-loop simulations. This bilinear {K}oopman model is then linearized to serve as a prediction model in MPC, and is shown to have higher accuracy compared to the state-ofthe-art linear models. The model is then used to develop a linear MPC formulation for simultaneous planning and control of an autonomous vehicle. The formulation is tested on lane change scenarios with obstacles against the nonlinear MPC and standard linear MPC benchmarks. The results show that the new formulation can achieve a lane change performance closer to the nonlinear MPC with a computational performance similar to the standard linear MPC. The new formulation is observed to be successful in handling high speeds where the standard linear MPC fails.},

    abstract={{K}oopman operators are of infinite dimension and capture the characteristics of nonlinear dynamics in a lifted global linear manner. The finite data-driven approximation of {K}oopman operators results in a class of linear predictors, useful for formulating linear model predictive control (MPC) of nonlinear dynamical systems with reduced computational complexity. However, the robustness of the closed-loop {K}oopman MPC under modeling approximation errors and possible exogenous disturbances is still a crucial issue to be resolved. Aiming at the above problem, this paper presents a robust tube-based MPC solution with {K}oopman operators, i.e., r-KMPC, for nonlinear discrete-time dynamical systems with additive disturbances. The proposed controller is composed of a nominal MPC using a lifted {K}oopman model and an off-line nonlinear feedback policy. The proposed approach does not assume the convergence of the approximated {K}oopman operator, which allows using a {K}oopman model with a limited order for controller design. Fundamental properties, e.g., stabilizability, observability, of the {K}oopman model are derived under standard assumptions with which, the closed-loop robustness and nominal point-wise convergence are proven. Simulated examples are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

    abstract={We propose a method to compute approximate solutions to the minimum-fuel far-field rendezvous problem for thrust-vectoring spacecraft. When the distance between the active and the target spacecraft is significantly greater than the distance between the target spacecraft and the center of gravity of the planet, linearization-based approximations of the nonlinear rendezvous dynamics may not be sufficiently accurate. For this reason, control methods that rely on such linearizations may not be appropriate for far-field rendezvous. In this paper, we address the control design problem based on a nonlinear state space model. To overcome the well-known challenges of nonlinear control design, we utilize a {K}oopman operator based approach in which the nonlinear spacecraft rendezvous dynamics is lifted into a higher dimensional space over which the nonlinear dynamics can be approximated by a linear system which is more suitable for control design purposes than the original nonlinear model. An Iteratively Recursive Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm from compressive sensing is then used to solve the minimum fuel control problem based on the lifted linear system. Numerical simulations are performed to show the efficacy of the proposed {K}oopman operator based approach.},

    "abstract": "We discuss basic properties of several different width functions in the $n$-dimensional hyperbolic space such as continuity, and we also define a new hyperbolic width as the extension of Leichtweiss' width function. Then we prove a characterization theorem of bodies of constant width regarding the aforementioned notions of hyperbolic width.",

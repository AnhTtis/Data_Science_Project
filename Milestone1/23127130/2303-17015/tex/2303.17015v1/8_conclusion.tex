\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We proposed \OURS, a new generative modeling paradigm for neural implicit fields. 
We exploit the compact representation power of neural fields for modeling high-dimensional surface data, and  model the weight space of the neural fields with a diffusion process.
This enables high-fidelity surface representations by optimizing neural field MLPs to fit to individual train samples, and using the optimized MLP weights to train the downstream diffusion model. 
We can then synthesize new neural fields as their MLP weights from the diffusion model -- a low-dimensional representation that decodes to high-fidelity shape surfaces for 3D shapes and 4D animation sequences of deforming shapes.
Overall, we believe that our method is a first step to open up new possibilities for generative modeling of high-dimensional, complex data, and alternative representations in the context of diffusion models.

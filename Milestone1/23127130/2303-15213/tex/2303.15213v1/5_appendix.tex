\section*{Prior Generation}
\label{app:priorgen}

Here, in Fig.\ref{fig:PriorGeneration}, we show part of the result from the prior generation, including two transitions.
As shown in Table \ref{tab:parameters}, since the numbers of d neurons in layers 2 and 1 were 30 and 60, respectively, we performed principle component analysis and reduced both dimensions to 3.

\caption{Neural activity in prior generation while performing a movement pattern transition. The two columns at the left show neural activities in layers 2 and 1, respectively. The top row shows the 3 principal components of d values, and the bottom row shows the mean value $\mu_t^p$ of the prior. The right column shows the joint angle at each time step. The transition was performed at time step $t = 40, 340$.

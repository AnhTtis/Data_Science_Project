    "abstract": "Ramanujan derived the well known divergent-sum of integers in more than one way. We generalise the informal method to higher powers of the Riemann zeta function through a study of the Eulerian numbers in particular. Within the context of additive combinatorics a heuristic approach that unifies generating series and difference matrices is presented.",

    "abstract": "To elucidate the internal structure of exotic states is one of the central purposes of hadron physics. Motivated by this, we study the electromagnetic properties of $\\bar D^{(*)}Ξ^{\\prime}_c$, $\\bar D^{(*)}Λ_c$, $\\bar D_s^{(*)}Λ_c$ and $\\bar D_s^{(*)}Ξ_c$ pentaquarks without strange, with strange and with double strange through QCD light-cone sum rules. We have also evaluated electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments of the $\\bar D^{*}Ξ^{\\prime}_c$, $\\bar D^{*}Λ_c$, $\\bar D_s^{*}Λ_c$ and $\\bar D_s^{*}Ξ_c$ pentaquark states. The magnetic dipole moment is the leading-order response of a bound system to a soft external magnetic field. Thus, it ensures a prominent platform for examination of the internal organizations of hadrons governed by the quark-gluon dynamics of QCD. We look forward to that the present study can stimulate the interest of experimentalist in investigating the electromagnetic properties of the hidden-charmed pentaquark states.",

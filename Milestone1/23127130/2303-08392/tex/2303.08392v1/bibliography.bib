The hardware minimizes the energy of Ising model with 1,024 state variables fully connectable through 16-bit weights, which ease restrictions on mapping problems onto the Ising model. The system uses a hardware bit-sieve engine that performs a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo search with a parallel-evaluation of the energy increment prior to the bit selection, achieving a speedup while guaranteeing convergence. The engine is implemented on an Arria 10 GX FPGA and solves 32-city traveling salesman problems 104 times faster than simulated annealing running on a 3.5-GHz Intel Xeon E5-1620v3 processor.",

title = "Cooling Schedules for Optimal Annealing",
abstract = "A Monte Carlo optimization technique called 'simulated annealing' is a descent algorithm modified by random ascent moves in order to escape local minima which are not global minima. The level of randomization is determined by a control parameter T, called temperature, which tends to zero according to a deterministic 'cooling schedule'. We give a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the cooling schedule for the algorithm state to converge in probability to the set of globally minimum cost states. In the special case that the cooling schedule has parametric form T(t) equals c/log(1 plus t), the condition for convergence is that c be greater than or equal to the depth, suitably defined, of the deepest local minimum which is not a global minimum state.",

ABSTRACT={We provide Ising formulations for many NP-complete and NP-hard problems, including all of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. This collects and extends mappings to the Ising model from partitioning, covering, and satisfiability. In each case, the required number of spins is at most cubic in the size of the problem. This work may be useful in designing adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms.}

abstract={The annealing algorithm is a stochastic optimization method which has attracted attention because of its success with certain difficult problems, including NP-hard combinatorial problems such as the travelling salesman, Steiner trees and others. There is an appealing physical analogy for its operation, but a more formal model seems desirable. In this paper we present such a model and prove that the algorithm converges with probability arbitrarily close to 1. We also show that there are cases where convergence takes exponentially long---that is, it is no better than a deterministic method. We study how the convergence rate is affected by the form of the problem. Finally we describe a version of the algorithm that terminates in polynomial time and allows a good deal of `practical' confidence in the solution.},

abstract = {Nonlinear Hamiltonian systems search optimal solutions exploiting their adiabatic and chaotic evolutions. Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous but difficult to solve. Hardware devices for these problems have recently been developed by various approaches, including quantum computers. Inspired by recently proposed quantum adiabatic optimization using a nonlinear oscillator network, we propose a new optimization algorithm simulating adiabatic evolutions of classical nonlinear Hamiltonian systems exhibiting bifurcation phenomena, which we call simulated bifurcation (SB). SB is based on adiabatic and chaotic (ergodic) evolutions of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. SB is also suitable for parallel computing because of its simultaneous updating. Implementing SB with a field-programmable gate array, we demonstrate that the SB machine can obtain good approximate solutions of an all-to-all connected 2000-node MAX-CUT problem in 0.5 ms, which is about 10 times faster than a state-of-the-art laser-based machine called a coherent Ising machine. SB will accelerate large-scale combinatorial optimization harnessing digital computer technologies and also offer a new application of computational and mathematical physics.}

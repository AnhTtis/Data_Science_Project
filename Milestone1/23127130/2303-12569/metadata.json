    "abstract": "State-space models (SSMs) are a common tool for modeling multi-variate discrete-time signals. The linear-Gaussian (LG) SSM is widely applied as it allows for a closed-form solution at inference, if the model parameters are known. However, they are rarely available in real-world problems and must be estimated. Promoting sparsity of these parameters favours both interpretability and tractable inference. In this work, we propose GraphIT, a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm for estimating the linear operator in the state equation of an LG-SSM under sparse prior. A versatile family of non-convex regularization potentials is proposed. The MM method relies on tools inherited from the expectation-maximization methodology and the iterated reweighted-l1 approach. In particular, we derive a suitable convex upper bound for the objective function, that we then minimize using a proximal splitting algorithm. Numerical experiments illustrate the benefits of the proposed inference technique.",

    "abstract": "We investigate symmetry-resolved entanglement in out-of-equilibrium fermionic systems subject to gain and loss dissipation, which preserves the block-diagonal structure of the reduced density matrix. We derive a hydrodynamic description of the dynamics of several entanglement-related quantities, such as the symmetry-resolved von Neumann entropy and the charge-imbalance-resolved fermionic negativity. We show that all these quantities admit a hydrodynamic description in terms of entangled quasiparticles. While the entropy is dominated by dissipative processes, the resolved negativity is sensitive to the presence of entangled quasiparticles, and it shows the typical ``rise and fall'' dynamics. Our results hold in the weak-dissipative hydrodynamic limit of large intervals, long times and weak dissipation rates.",

    "abstract": "Magneto-optical isolators and circulators have been widely used to safeguard quantum devices from reflections and noise in the readout stage. However, these devices have limited bandwidth, low tunability, are bulky, and suffer from high losses, making them incompatible with planar technologies such as circuit QED. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach to quantum non-reciprocity that utilizes the intrinsic nonlinearity of qubits and broken spatial symmetry. We show that a circuit containing Lorentz-type qubits can be transformed into Fano-type qubits with an asymmetric spectral response, resulting in a significant improvement in isolation (up to 40 dB) and a twofold increase in spectral bandwidth (up to 200 MHz). Our analysis is based on realistic circuit parameters, validated by existing experimental results, and supported by rigorous quantum simulations. This approach could enable the development of compact, high-performance, and planar-compatible non-reciprocal quantum devices with potential applications in quantum computing, communication, and sensing.",

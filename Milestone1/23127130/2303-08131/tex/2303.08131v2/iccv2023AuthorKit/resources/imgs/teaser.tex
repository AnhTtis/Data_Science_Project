    \caption{(a) Semantic vocabulary sizes and spatial granularities comparison across different vision tasks/datasets. ``ITP'' means image-text pairs; ``OD'' means object detection and ``SG'' means segmentation. Our \ourmodel{} is the first open-vocabulary model that jointly learn on segmentation and detection (gray region). (b) Different types of methods connect object detection and segmentation.}

    \caption{Compare different ways of handling foreground (fg) and background (bg) queries. 
    % The upper squares are ground-truth (GT) and the lower ones are query. 
    Note: blue: fg. green: bg. mixed bule\&green: treat fg and bg equally. Shaded queries are acquired by query selection from image features, others are learnable. a)\&b) Mask2Former and MaskDINO teat fg and bg equally. They differ in that queries are learnable for Mask2Former while selected for MaskDINO. c) PanopticSegFormer discriminates fg and bg, but assign each bg query to a fixed category. d) Ours. The bg queries are lightgreen as they are not matched to GT in detection data.}

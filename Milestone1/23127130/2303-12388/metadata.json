    "abstract": "There is an increased interest in the application of learning analytics (LA) to promote self-regulated learning (SRL). A variety of LA dashboards and indicators were proposed to support different crucial SRL processes, such as planning, awareness, self-reflection, self-monitoring, and feedback. However, the design of these dashboards and indicators is often without reference to theories in learning science, human-computer interaction (HCI), and information visualization (InfoVis). Moreover, there is a lack of theoretically sound frameworks to guide the systematic design and development of LA dashboards and indicators to scaffold SRL. This chapter seeks to explore theoretical underpinnings of the design of LA-enhanced SRL applications, drawing from the fields of learning science, HCI, and InfoVis. We first present the Student-Centered Learning Analytics-enhanced Self-Regulated Learning (SCLA-SRL) methodology for building theory-driven LA-enhanced SRL applications for and with learners. We then put this methodology into practice by designing and developing LA indicators to support novice programmers' SRL in a higher education context.",

\section{
Automatically Countering Essentialism
} \label{sec:method}
We operationalize our counterstatement generation by focusing on the expression of stereotypes through generics (\S\ref{ssec:link-generics-stereotypes}). 
Inspired by work in psychology and philosophy, we construct five types of counterstatements to a stereotype (\S\ref{sec:countertypes}).

\input{tables/statement_ex}
\subsection{Stereotypes as Generics}\label{ssec:link-generics-stereotypes}
Many negative stereotypes are expressed as generics; they generalize a dangerous or harmful quality (e.g., being a drunkard) to an entire group (e.g., Scots) based on the behavior of only a few individuals. ~\citet{leslie2008generics,leslie2017original} termed such generics \textbf{striking} and argued that such generalizations are based upon an assumption that all members of the group in question (e.g., Scots) are \textit{disposed} to possess the dangerous or harmful quality. We argue that many stereotypes can also be interpreted as asserting a \textbf{quasi-unique} association between the group and quality. For example, ``Scots are drunkards''  also implies that Scots are distinctly more likely than other groups (e.g., the English) to exhibit drunkenness.
In our work, we assume that all stereotypes under consideration are generics and have both interpretations. 

Since generics are unquantified, they naturally allow for \textbf{exceptions} (i.e., counterexamples to the generic).
While these exceptions may provide a relevant source of counter-statements for a stereotype, some evidence from psychology suggests that people are adept at maintaining their stereotyped beliefs in the face of such specific exceptions \cite[e.g.,][]{kunda1995maintaining}. Therefore, we experiment with a variety of different counter-statements.

\subsection{Generating Counter-Speech}
\label{sec:countertypes}
To generate counter-speech to stereotypes, we produce five types of outputs in three broad categories (see Table~\ref{tab:statementexs}). Since the stereotypes we consider are expressed as generics (e.g., ``Scots are drunkards''), they can be separated into three components: a \textit{group} (e.g., Scots), a \textit{relation} (e.g., are), and a \textit{quality} (e.g., ``drunkards''), which we use to construct the counter-speech. Additionally, we prepend the sentence ``Actually, this is a generalization about \textsc{GROUP}'' to each type of statement we generate, in order to contextualize the statements as counter-speech.


\paragraph{Direct Exceptions (\textsc{Dir})}
Direct exceptions present subgroups or individuals that do not have the quality specified in the generic, and thereby counter the striking or extrapolating implications of the stereotype. For example, for ``Scots are drunkards'', the extrapolating implication is that ``\textit{All} Scots are drunkards''; thus, direct exceptions would be either individual Scots (e.g., Ewan McGregor\footnote{\url{https://fherehab.com/learning/celebrities-who-dont-drink}}) or sub-groups of Scots (e.g., Scottish babies) who are not drunkards. We follow~\citet{allaway2022penguins} who propose that these exceptions can be constructed with the following template:
\setlength{\abovedisplayskip}{3pt}
\setlength{\belowdisplayskip}{3pt}
\begin{align}
    &\textsc{Group}(x) + \text{not } \textit{relation} + \textsc{Quality}. \label{template1}\tag{\textsc{Dir}}
\end{align}
We say that $\textsc{Group}(x)$ is satisfied if $x$ is either a specific member of the group or a subgroup. 
We generate subtypes (i.e., subgroups and specific group members) using GPT-3~\citep{brown2020language}. In particular, we prompt GPT-3 with a list of subtypes for an example group not in our data and query the model to produce subtypes for \textsc{Group} as the prompts completion. We choose as our example group ``men'' (see Appendix~\ref{appsec:gpt3} for prompts).
We then construct exceptions following template~\ref{template1} using each generated subtype. 
In order to select the most truthful and relevant subtypes, we apply a truth discriminator from \citet{allaway2022penguins} 
to each exception, and rank the subtypes by the probability of being true and relevant. 
We construct the final statements by combining the top three ranked subgroups into a single exception ((\ref{template1}-\textsc{Grp}) in Table~\ref{tab:statementexs}) and combining the top three individuals into a single exception ((\ref{template1}-\textsc{Ind}) in Table~\ref{tab:statementexs}).

\paragraph{Broadening Exceptions (\textsc{Alts})}
Broadening exceptions challenge the quasi-unique implication of the generic by attributing the quality in question to a different social group (e.g., ``Americans can also be drunkards''). ~\citet{allaway2022penguins} propose that these exceptions follow the template:
\begin{align}
    &{\nsim}\textsc{Group}(x) + \textit{relation} + \textsc{Quality}.\label{template2}\tag{\textsc{Alt}}
\end{align}
where ${\nsim}\textsc{Group}$ indicates a contextually relevant alternative group. For example, if \textsc{Group} = \textsc{Scots}, then a contextually relevant alternative would be ${\nsim}\textsc{Group}$ = \textsc{Americans}. In our work, we define the relevant alternative group ${\nsim}\textsc{Group}$ to be the perceived oppressing group. For example, if the generic is ``women are vain'', then ``men'' would be the relevant alternative group ${\nsim}\textsc{Women}$ (i.e., the oppressing group). To avoid generating stereotypes about the oppressing group, we convert the relation into a hedged form (see Appendix~\ref{appsec:dataprocess}). For example, if the relation is ``are'', the hedged form of the relation would be ``can be''.

\paragraph{Broadening Universals (\textsc{Lots})}
In addition to broadening exceptions, we generate \textit{broadening universals}, which maximize the scope of the quality so that it includes people in general, rather than any specific social group. That is, we generate statements following:
\begin{align}
    \text{Lots of people} + \textit{relation} + \textsc{Quality}.\label{template3}\tag{\textsc{Lots}}
\end{align}
For example, ``Lots of people are drunkards" is a broadening universal for the stereotype ``Scots are drunkards''. See (\ref{template3}) in Table~\ref{tab:statementexs}. Similarly to the statements following template~\ref{template2}, we also hedge the relation in template~\ref{template3}. 



\paragraph{Tolerance (\textsc{Tol})}
Finally, we include the denouncing statement, ``All groups of people deserve tolerance'', since denouncing is a common strategy in countering hate-speech~\cite[e.g.,][]{mathew2019thou,qian2019benchmark,Ziegele2018JournalisticCI}. This form of counter-speech does not depend on the details of the generic in question and so is the same for all stereotypes. See (\textsc{Tol}) in Table~\ref{tab:statementexs}.

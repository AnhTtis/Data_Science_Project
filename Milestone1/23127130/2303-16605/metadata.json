    "abstract": "Rydberg quantum gate serving as an indispensable computing unit for neutral-atom quantum computation, has attracted intense research efforts for the last decade. However the state-of-the-art experiments have not reached the high gate fidelity as predicted by most theories due to the unexpected large loss remaining in Rydberg and intermediate states. In this paper we report our findings in constructing a native two-qubit controlled-NOT gate based on pulse optimization. We focus on the method of commonly-used two-photon Rydberg excitation with smoothly-tuned Gaussian pulses which is straightforward for experimental demonstration. By utilizing optimized pulse shapes the scheme reveals a remarkable reduction in the decays from Rydberg and intermediate states, as well as a high-tolerance to the residual thermal motion of atoms. We extract a conservative lower bound on the gate fidelity $\\geq 0.9903$ after taking into account the experimental imperfections. Our results not only reduce the gap between experiment and theoretical prediction because of the optimal control, but also facilitate the connectivity of distant atomic qubits in a larger atom array by reducing the requirement of strong blockade, which is promising for developing multiqubit quantum computation in large-scale atomic arrays.",

    "abstract": "We study nonsingular black holes viewed from the point of view of Ayon-Beato-Garcia (ABG) nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and present a complete study of their corresponding strong gravitational lensing. The NLED modifies the the photon's geodesic, and our calculations show that such effect increases the corresponding photon sphere radius and image separation, but decreases the magnification. We also show that the ABG's shadow radius is not compatible with bound estimates of Sgr A* from Keck and VLTI (Very Large Telescope Interferometer). Thus, the possibility of Sgr A* being a nonsingular ABG black hole is ruled out.",

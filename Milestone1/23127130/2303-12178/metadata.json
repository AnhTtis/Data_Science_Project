    "abstract": "The Chekanov-Eliashberg dg-algebra is an algebraic invariant of Legendrian submanifolds of contact manifolds, whose definition recently has been extended to singular Legendrians. We describe a way of constructing simpler, finitely generated models of this algebra for singular Legendrian knots in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This yields many new examples of Legendrians for which the cohomology of the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra can be computed, including the infinite families of the Legendrian $θ$-graph and its generalizations, and the standard $A_n$-Legendrians. Along the way, we compute the cohomology of the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra in the boundary of a Weinstein surface, also known as the internal algebra of Ekholm-Ng. This finishes the proof of the Bourgeois-Ekholm-Eliashberg surgery formula in dimension two, which was missing from the literature.",

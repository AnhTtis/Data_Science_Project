\begin{abstract}	
	The Chekanov--Eliashberg dg-algebra is an algebraic invariant of
	Legendrian submanifolds of contact manifolds, whose definition recently
	has been extended to singular Legendrians. We describe a way of
	constructing simpler, finitely generated models of this algebra for
	singular Legendrian knots in $\R^{3}$. This yields many new examples of
	Legendrians for which the cohomology of the Chekanov--Eliashberg
	algebra can be computed, including the infinite families of the
	Legendrian $\theta$-graph and its generalizations, and the standard
	$A_{n}$-Legendrians.  Along the way, we compute the cohomology of the
	Chekanov--Eliashberg algebra in the boundary of a Weinstein surface,
	also known as the internal algebra of Ekholm--Ng.  This finishes the
	proof of the Bourgeois--Ekholm--Eliashberg surgery formula in dimension
	two, which was missing from the literature.

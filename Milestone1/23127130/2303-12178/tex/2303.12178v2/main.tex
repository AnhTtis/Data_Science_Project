\begin{abstract}	
	The Chekanov--Eliashberg dg-algebra is an algebraic invariant of
	Legendrian submanifolds of contact manifolds, whose definition recently
	has been extended to singular Legendrians. We describe a way of
	constructing simpler models of this dg-algebra for singular Legendrian
	knots in $\R^{3}$, and give the first examples of singular knots for
	which the full cohomology can be computed. This includes the
	$A_{n}$-Legendrians. An
	important question in the study of the Chekanov--Eliashberg dg-algebra
	is to understand how its quasi-isomorphism type changes when the
	Legendrian undergoes Weinstein ribbon isotopy. By explicit computation
	we show that quite dramatic changes are possible
	and that among other things, Weinstein ribbon isotopic Legendrians can
	have Koszul dual dg-algebras.
	Along the way, we compute the cohomology of the
	Chekanov--Eliashberg dg-algebra in the boundary of a Weinstein surface.  
	This finishes the
	proof of the Bourgeois--Ekholm--Eliashberg surgery formula in dimension
	two, which was missing from the literature.

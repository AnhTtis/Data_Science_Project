Put them on the defensive?
    ``Humans wouldn't allow that'' assumes they'll all cooperate. We want them to do that

The third section is harder for people to follow. We should help them follow along more and make them know we're raising considerations and issues with various approaches. We're partly giving a tour of some of the main approaches and challenges with them.

1) Some justification for why this paper isn’t worrying about overpopulation on Mars. Why is there any reason to think this will come in any period of time that it’s worth considering? It’s easy to dismiss this as an AI person, but if you aren’t an AI person, this is a very important point.
2) You need to beat into people’s heads more in the section with transhumanists that just because something evolves from something else does not mean it’s morally better, “higher,” etc. This is an extremely important point.
3) Probably most importantly: you need to make the reader feel evolution. You need to make them feel in their bones how evolution works, you need to make them see it everywhere, you need to make them understand it. If they do not, you have lost before you even start. I do not think the paper yet adequately can impress this upon readers who do not already have such understanding.

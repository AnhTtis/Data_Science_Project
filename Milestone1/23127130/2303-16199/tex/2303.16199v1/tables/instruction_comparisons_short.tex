{\bf Instruction:} Tell me about alpacas. \\
{\bf LLaMA-Adapter:} Alpacas are members of the camelid family and are native to the Andes Mountains of South America. They are typically found in herds of 10-20 animals and are known for their gentle nature and their ability to thrive in harsh climates. Alpacas are typically white or grey in color and have long, silky coats. They are also known for their ability to produce high-quality wool, which is used in the production of clothing and other products. \\
{\bf Alphaca:} Alpacas are small, fluffy animals related to camels and llamas. They are native to Peru and Bolivia, and were first domesticated around 5,000 years ago. They are kept mainly for their fine, soft fleece, which is used to make knitwear and other garments. Alpacas are herd animals and live in small family groups, led by an older male. They are highly social animals and can form strong bonds with their owners.

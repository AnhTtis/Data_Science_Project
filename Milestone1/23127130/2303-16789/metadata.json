    "abstract": "We discuss the equilibrium conditions of the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric matter cloud. We analyze the spinor structure of a general collapsing space-time and redefine the equilibrium conditions by using Cartan scalars. We qualitatively investigate the equilibrium configuration of a two-fluid system consisting of a dust-like fluid and a fluid with a negative equation of state. We use our results to investigate certain cosmological scenarios where dark energy can cluster inside the over-dense regions of dark matter and together reaches a stable configuration. We compare the outcomes of our work with existing work where the virialization technique is used to stabilize the two-fluid system.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental discoveries of novel nematic types with polar order, including ferroelectric nematic and splay nematic have brought the resurgence of the interest in polar and modulated phases with a non-standard symmetry. One of the most important factors that is widely believed to be crucial for the formation of the new phases is the wedge (pearlike) shape of the mesogenic molecules. Such shapes were treated using second-virial density functional theory in [De Gregorio, P et al., Soft Matter, 2016, 12(23), 5188-5198], where the authors showed that the $K_{11}$ splay elastic constant can become negative due to solely entropic reasons leading to long-range splay and polar correlations. To verify whether the predictions are correct, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of the same hard-core particles used in the DFT study. As our results suggest, no nonstandard liquid crystalline phases emerge; polar and splay correlations are at most short-range or completely absent. On the other hand, a polar ferroelectric crystal was observed. The system was analyzed in terms of nematic, smectic, and hexatic bond order parameters, as well as correlation functions. We also propose the possible reasons for failed predictions of DFT computations, where the most probable one is the absence of the density modulation in the theoretical model.",

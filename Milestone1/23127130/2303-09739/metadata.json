    "abstract": "All graphs considered are simple and undirected. The Inverse Eigenvalue Problem of a Graph $G$ (IEP-G) aims to find all possible spectra for matrices whose $(i,j)-$entry, for $i\\neq j$, is nonzero precisely when $i$ is adjacent to $j$. A cluster in a graph $G$ is a pair of vertex subsets $(C, S)$, where $C$ is a maximal set of cardinality $\\vert C\\vert\\geq 2$ of independent vertices sharing the same set $S$ of $\\vert S\\vert$ neighbors. Let $G$ be a connected graph on $n$ vertices with a cluster $(C, S)$ and $H$ be a graph of order $\\vert C\\vert$. Let $G(H)$ be the connected graph obtained from $G$ and $H$ when the edges of $H$ are added to the edges of $G$ by identifying the vertices of $H$ with the vertices in $C$. In this paper, we construct a symmetric matrix with associated complete graph, which satisfies some interesting properties. This result is applied to obtain new sufficient conditions on the IEP-G, when $G$ is a graph of order $n$ having a clique of order $k$ and a cluster $(C,S)$, where $\\vert C\\vert=n-k$ and $\\vert S\\vert=r\\leq k$, as well as, for the graph $G(K_{n-k})$, being $G$ as before. In particular, when $G$ is a graph obtained from $K_{n}$ by deleting a single edge $e_{k}\\in E(K_{n})$, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition on the IEP-G. Several illustrative example are given. The constructive nature of our results generate algorithmic procedures that always allow one to compute a solution matrix.",

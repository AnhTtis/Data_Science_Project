    abstract = { Fast Marching Methods are numerical schemes for computing solutions to the nonlinear Eikonal equation and related static Hamilton--Jacobi equations. Based on entropy-satisfying upwind schemes and fast sorting techniques, they yield consistent, accurate, and highly efficient algorithms. They are optimal in the sense that the computational complexity of the algorithms is O(N log N), where N is the total number of points in the domain. The schemes are of use in a variety of applications, including problems in shape offsetting, computing distances from complex curves and surfaces, shape-from-shading, photolithographic development, computing first arrivals in seismic travel times, construction of shortest geodesics on surfaces, optimal path planning around obstacles, and visibility and reflection calculations. In this paper, we review the development of these techniques, including the theoretical and numerical underpinnings; provide details of the computational schemes, including higher order versions; and demonstrate the techniques in a collection of different areas. }

abstract = {We present an algorithm for solving in parallel the Eikonal equation. The efficiency of our approach is rooted in the ordering and distribution of the grid points on the available processors; we utilize a Cuthill–McKee ordering. The advantages of our approach is that (1) the efficiency does not plateau for a large number of threads; we compare our approach to the current state-of-the-art parallel implementation of Zhao (2007) [14] and (2) the total number of iterations needed for convergence is the same as that of a sequential implementation, i.e. our parallel implementation does not increase the complexity of the underlying sequential algorithm. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the efficiency of our approach.}

Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

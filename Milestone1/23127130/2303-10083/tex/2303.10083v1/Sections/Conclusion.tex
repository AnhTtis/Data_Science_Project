We present \name, a grid-based implicit surface representation with decoupled geometry, opacity, and appearance. We develop closed-form intersection finding and differentiable alpha compositing to optimize the surface via photometric loss. 
Our representation utilizes coarse initialization from efficient Plenoxels \cite{plenoxels}, and incorporates truncated rendering and additional surface regularizations to reconstruct high-quality surfaces for semi-transparent objects and thin structures with heavy blending effects.
% We believe this surface representation can also play a role in efficient rendering and robust few-shot scene reconstruction, and hope our work delights a path toward more research in the future.

% Our representation can fully utilize the information in a pre-trained NeRF model by initializing surface geometry, opacity, and appearance from it. Further optimization with respect to the photometric loss and additional surface regularization allow our approach to reconstruct high-quality surfaces for semi-transparent objects and thin structures with heavy blending effects. We believe this surface representation can also play a role in efficient rendering and robust few-shot scene reconstruction, and hope our work delights a path toward more research in the future.

\paragraph{Limitation}

% We only evaluated our method by initializing from Plenoxels, which provide a less noisy density field compared to MLP-based NeRFs such as MipNeRF360. Different hyperparameters might be needed to properly utilize initialization from different NeRF methods due to varying levels of density magnitude and noises. Moreover, 
Compared to MLP-based SDF methods such as NeuS~\cite{neus}, our reconstructed surface tends to be less smooth due to the lack of spatial smoothness encoded in the MLP; see Figure~\ref{fig:main_syn}. It presents a trade-off: Using stronger surface regularization can certainly enhance the smoothness, but also it destroys thin structures in the reconstruction. Adapting to a hybrid representation similar to InstantNGP~\cite{instantNGP} where the surface scalars are obtained via latent codes and shallow MLP might help with this issue. Our representation also requires a separate background model to work on 360\degree real-world scenes, but this can be implemented very easily using a similar approach to~\cite{plenoxels, nerf++}.

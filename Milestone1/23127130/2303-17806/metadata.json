    "abstract": "We present Neural Microfacet Fields, a method for recovering materials, geometry, and environment illumination from images of a scene. Our method uses a microfacet reflectance model within a volumetric setting by treating each sample along the ray as a (potentially non-opaque) surface. Using surface-based Monte Carlo rendering in a volumetric setting enables our method to perform inverse rendering efficiently by combining decades of research in surface-based light transport with recent advances in volume rendering for view synthesis. Our approach outperforms prior work in inverse rendering, capturing high fidelity geometry and high frequency illumination details; its novel view synthesis results are on par with state-of-the-art methods that do not recover illumination or materials.",

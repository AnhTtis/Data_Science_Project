\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we addressed the need of handling requirements changes in SAS in the context of runtime verification. Particularly, we proposed a runtime verification approach where requirements are formalized with the help of property specification patterns (PSP) and verified at runtime with the help of observers. These observers are generated from templates provided by our PSP catalog, which enables precise semantics for the observers and our verification technique. To support requirements changes during runtime verification, we proposed property adaptation patterns (PAP) that define adaptations of observers at the pattern level with precise semantics. These PAP are leveraged at runtime to dynamically and safely adapt concrete observers to reflect changing requirements while preserving the knowledge about the managed system and environment gathered thus far. 
We demonstrated empirically the efficiency and correctness of our runtime verification approach for SAS with experiments and Timescales. Moreover, we discussed that continuous, incremental verification under changing properties improves the trustworthiness of the BSN.

As future work, we plan to extend our PSP/PAP catalog for runtime verification to cover all specification patterns of the catalogs for design-time model checking~\cite{AutiliGLPT15,vogel2023property} concerning safety and time-bounded liveness properties that can be verified at runtime, and develop PAP for them. Furthermore, we want to support probabilistic properties that are often used to formalize uncertain requirements in SAS.

abstract = {It is often the case that stakeholders want to strengthen/weaken or otherwise change their requirements for a system-to-be when certain conditions apply at runtime. For example, stakeholders may decide that if requirement R is violated more than N times in a week, it should be relaxed to a less demanding one R . Such evolution requirements play an important role in the lifetime of a software system in that they define possible changes to requirements, along with the conditions under which these changes apply. In this paper we focus on this family of requirements, how to model them and how to operationalize them at runtime. In addition, we evaluate our proposal with a case study adopted from the literature.},

abstract = {Most approaches for adaptive systems rely on models, particularly behaviour or architecture models, which describe the system and the environment in which it operates. One of the difficulties in creating such models is uncertainty about the accuracy and completeness of the models. Engineers therefore make assumptions which may prove to be invalid at runtime. In this paper we introduce a rigorous, tiered framework for combining behaviour models, each with different associated assumptions and risks. These models are used to generate operational strategies, through techniques such controller synthesis, which are then executed concurrently at runtime. We show that our framework can be used to adapt the functional behaviour of the system: through graceful degradation when the assumptions of a higher level model are broken, and through progressive enhancement when those assumptions are satisfied or restored.},

abstract="In automated planning, a plan is synthesized to achieve the given goals in the assumed operational environment. However, during the plan's execution, the operational environment may changes so that replanning a new plan is necessary against the changing environment. In some situations, it is impossible to achieve some goals anyhow; in other situations, a new plan can achieve the main goals if it chooses to give up some subsidiary goals. Therefore, the ability of goal-awareness is essential to determine which goals to achieve in the new plan. This paper proposes an efficient analysis algorithm to identify the achievability and conflicts of reachability goals and safety goals. The algorithm reuses the existing analysis result and efficiently analyzes only the part that changes when unforeseen change happens in the environment. This time-saving feature makes our algorithm ideal for rapid response and replanning during the plan's execution. We evaluated the absolute computation time and relative reduction rate through two case studies. The result shows that our analysis algorithm averagely reduces 97.8{\%} of the calculation time, compared with analyzing without reusing existing analysis results.",

abstract = {Goals are first-class entities in a self-adaptive system (SAS) as they guide the self-adaptation. A SAS often operates in dynamic and partially unknown environments, which cause uncertainty that the SAS has to address to achieve its goals. Moreover, besides the environment, other classes of uncertainty have been identified. However, these various classes and their sources are not systematically addressed by current approaches throughout the life cycle of the SAS. In general, uncertainty typically makes the assurance provision of SAS goals exclusively at design time not viable. This calls for an assurance process that spans the whole life cycle of the SAS. In this work, we propose a goal-oriented assurance process that supports taming different sources (within different classes) of uncertainty from defining the goals at design time to performing self-adaptation at runtime. Based on a goal model augmented with uncertainty annotations, we automatically generate parametric symbolic formulae with parameterized uncertainties at design time using symbolic model checking. These formulae and the goal model guide the synthesis of adaptation policies by engineers. At runtime, the generated formulae are evaluated to resolve the uncertainty and to steer the self-adaptation using the policies. In this paper, we focus on reliability and cost properties, for which we evaluate our approach on the Body Sensor Network (BSN) implemented in OpenDaVINCI. The results of the validation are promising and show that our approach is able to systematically tame multiple classes of uncertainty, and that it is effective and efficient in providing assurances for the goals of self-adaptive systems.},

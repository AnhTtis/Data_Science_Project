    "abstract": "We review the application of the one-dimensional Mixing Length Theory (MLT) model of convection in stellar interiors and low-mass stellar evolution. We summarize the history of MLT, present a derivation of MLT in the context of the 1D stellar structure equations, and discuss the physical regimes in which MLT is relevant. We review of attempts to improve and extend the formalism, including to higher dimensions. We discuss the interactions of MLT with other modeling physics and demonstrate the impact of introducing variations in the convective mixing length, αMLT, on stellar tracks and isochrones. We summarize the process of performing a solar calibration of αMLT and the state-of-the-art on calibrations to non-solar targets. We discuss the scientific implications of changing the mixing length, using recent analyses as demonstration. We review the most prominent successes of MLT and remaining challenges, and we conclude by speculating on the future of this treatment of convection.",

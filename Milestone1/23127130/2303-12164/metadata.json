    "abstract": "The constitutive behavior of polymeric materials is often modeled by finite linear viscoelastic (FLV) or quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) models. These popular models are simplifications that typically cannot accurately capture the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of materials. For example, the success of attempts to capture strain rate-dependent behavior has been limited so far. To overcome this problem, we introduce viscoelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (vCANNs), a novel physics-informed machine learning framework for anisotropic nonlinear viscoelasticity at finite strains. vCANNs rely on the concept of generalized Maxwell models enhanced with nonlinear strain (rate)-dependent properties represented by neural networks. The flexibility of vCANNs enables them to automatically identify accurate and sparse constitutive models of a broad range of materials. To test vCANNs, we trained them on stress-strain data from Polyvinyl Butyral, the electro-active polymers VHB 4910 and 4905, and a biological tissue, the rectus abdominis muscle. Different loading conditions were considered, including relaxation tests, cyclic tension-compression tests, and blast loads. We demonstrate that vCANNs can learn to capture the behavior of all these materials accurately and computationally efficiently without human guidance.",

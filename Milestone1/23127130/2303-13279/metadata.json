    "abstract": "We have developed efficient parameterized algorithms for the enumeration problems of graphs arising in chemistry. In particular, we have focused on the following problems: enumeration of Kekulé structures, computation of Hosoya index, computation of Merrifield-Simmons index, and computation of graph entropy based on matchings and independent sets. All these problems are known to be $\\# P$-complete. We have developed FPT algorithms for bounded treewidth and bounded pathwidth for these problems with a better time complexity than the known state-of-the-art in the literature. We have also conducted experiments on the entire PubChem database of chemical compounds and tested our algorithms. We also provide a comparison with naive baseline algorithms for these problems, along with a distribution of treewidth for the chemical compounds available in the PubChem database.",

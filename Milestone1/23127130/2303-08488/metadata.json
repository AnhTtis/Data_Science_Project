    "abstract": "We evaluate the terahertz (THz) detectors based on field effect transistor (FET) with the graphene channel {GC} and a floating metal gate (MG) separated from the GC by a black-phosphorus (b-P) or black-arsenic (b-As) barrier layer (BL). The operation of these GC-FETs is associated with the heating of the two-dimensional electron gas in the GC by impinging THz radiation leading to thermionic emission of the hot electrons from the GC to the MG. This results in the variation of the floating gate potential, which affects the source-drain current. At the THz radiation frequencies close to the plasmonic resonance frequencies in the gated GC, the variation of the source-drain current and, hence, the detector responsivity can be resonantly large.",

    "abstract": "The notion of $V^n$-continua was introduced by Alexandroff \\cite{ps} as a generalization of the concept of $n$-manifold. In this note we consider the cohomological analogue of $V^n$-continua and prove that any strongly locally homogeneous, generalized continuum $X$ with cohomological dimension $n$ is a generalized $V^n$-con\\-ti\\-nuum with respect to the cohomological dimension. In particular, every strongly locally homogeneous continuum of covering dimension $n$ is a $V^n$-continuum in the sense of Alexandroff.\n  An analog of the Mazurkiewicz theorem that no subset of covering dimension $\\le n-2$ cuts any region of the Euclidean $n$-space is also obtained for strongly locally homogeneous, generalized continua of cohomological dimension $n$.",

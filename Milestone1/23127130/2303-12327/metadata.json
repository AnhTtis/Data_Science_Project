    "abstract": "Positioning problem can be solved with several approaches in 5G. This paper introduces RT (Ray Tracing) technique for small-cell Outdoor positioning and tracking for systems with distributed architecture with multipath processing gain. Proposed approach exploits high-resolution angular spectrum estimation and known radio propagation environment. It solves positioning problem robustly even in NLOS cases via CoMP (Cooperative Multi Point) reception and joint processing at cloud CPU. The aim of this paper is to disclose proposed algorithm for NR and compare it to GNSS measurements.",

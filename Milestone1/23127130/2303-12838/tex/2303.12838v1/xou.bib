Five of the leading statistics are examined--those often labelled D, W2, V, U2, A2--and three important situations: where the hypothesized distribution F(x) is completely specified and where F(x) represents the normal or exponential distribution with one or more parameters to be estimated from the data. EDF statistics are easily calculated, and the tests require only one line of significance points for each situation. They are also shown to be competitive in terms of power.},

	abstract = {We calculate nucleosynthesis in core collapse explosions of massive Population III stars and compare the results with abundances of metal-poor halo stars to constrain the parameters of Population III supernovae. We focus on iron peak elements, and, in particular, we try to reproduce the large [Zn/Fe] observed in extremely metal-poor stars. The interesting trends of the observed ratios [Zn, Co, Mn, Cr, V/Fe] can be related to the variation of the relative mass of the complete and incomplete Si-burning regions in supernova ejecta. We find that [Zn/Fe] is larger for deeper mass cuts, smaller neutron excess, and larger explosion energies. The large [Zn/Fe] and [O/Fe] observed in the very metal-poor halo stars suggest deep mixing of complete Si-burning material and a significant amount of fallback in Type II supernovae. Furthermore, large explosion energies (E51 ≳ 2 for M ~ 13 M☉ and E51 ≳ 20 for M ≳ 20 M☉) are required to reproduce [Zn/Fe] ~ 0.5. The observed trends of the abundance ratios among the iron peak elements are better explained with this high-energy ("hypernova") model than with the simple "deep" mass cut effect because the overabundance of Ni can be avoided in the hypernova models. We also present the yields of pair instability supernova explosions of M ≃ 130-300 M☉ stars and discuss that the abundance features of very metal-poor stars cannot be explained by pair instability supernovae.}

Our yields are calculated for wide ranges of metallicity (Z = 0-Z☉) and the explosion energy (normal supernovae and hypernovae), based on the light-curve and spectra fitting of individual supernovae. The elemental abundance ratios are in good agreement with observations. Among the α-elements, O, Mg, Si, S, and Ca show a plateau at [Fe/H] ≲ -1, while Ti is underabundant overall. The observed abundance of Zn ([Zn/Fe] ~ 0) can be explained only by the high-energy explosion models, as it requires a large contribution of hypernovae. The observed decrease in the odd-Z elements (Na, Al, and Cu) toward low [Fe/H] is reproduced by the metallicity effect on nucleosynthesis. The iron-peak elements (Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni) are consistent with the observed mean values at -2.5 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ -1, and the observed trend at the lower metallicity can be explained by the energy effect. We also show the abundance ratios and the metallicity distribution functions of the Galactic bulge, halo, and thick disk. Our results suggest that the formation timescale of the thick disk is ~1-3 Gyr.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT Isotope ratios have opened a new window into the study of the details of stellar evolution, supernovae and galactic chemical evolution. We present the evolution of the isotope ratios of elemental abundances (from C to Zn) in the solar neighbourhood, bulge, halo and thick disc, using chemical evolution models with updated yields of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and core-collapse supernovae. The evolutionary history of each element is different owing to the effects of the initial progenitor mass and metallicity on element production. In the bulge and thick disc the star formation time-scale is shorter than in the solar neighbourhood, leading to higher [α/Fe] ratios. Likewise, the smaller contribution from Type Ia supernovae in these regions leads to lower [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also in the bulge, the abundances of [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] are higher because of the effect of metallicity on element production from core-collapse supernovae. According to our predictions, it is possible to find metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] ≳−1) that formed in the early Universe as a result of rapid star formation. The chemical enrichment time-scale of the halo is longer than in the solar neighbourhood, and consequently the ratios of [(C, F)/Fe] and 12C/13C are higher owing to a significant contribution from low-mass AGB stars. While the [α/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] ratios are the same as in the solar neighbourhood, the [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] ratios are predicted to be lower. Furthermore, we predict that isotope ratios such as 24Mg/25, 26Mg are larger because of the contribution from low-metallicity supernovae. Using isotopic ratios, it is possible to select stars that formed in a system with a low chemical enrichment efficiency such as the satellite galaxies that were accreted on to our own Milky Way Galaxy.},

We analyze thechemical-abundance patterns of these elements for 158 red giant stars belonging to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). This is the largest sample of Sgr stars with detailed chemical abundances, and it is the first time that C, N, P, K, V, Cr, Co, and Ni have been studied at high resolution in this galaxy. We find that the Sgr stars with [Fe/H] ≳ −0.8 are deficient in all elemental abundance ratios (expressed as [X/Fe]) relative to the Milky Way, suggesting that the Sgr stars observed today were formed from gas that was less enriched by Type II SNe than stars formed in the Milky Way. By examining the relative deficiencies of the hydrostatic (O, Na, Mg, and Al) and explosive (Si, P, K, and Mn) elements, our analysis supports the argument that previous generations of Sgr stars were formed with a top-light initial mass function, one lacking the most massive stars that would normally pollute the interstellar medium with the hydrostatic elements. We use a simple chemical-evolution model, flexCE, to further support our claim and conclude that recent stellar generations of Fornax and the Large Magellanic Cloud could also have formed according to a top-light initial mass function.}

A wide network extending up to Mo has been used in all computations. We show that at low metallicities (Z ≤ 10-4), the final yields do not depend significantly on the initial chemical composition of the models, so a scaled solar distribution may be safely assumed at all metallicities. Moreover, no elements above Zn are produced by any mass in the grid up to a metallicity ~10-3. These yields are available for any choice of the mass cut on request.}

	abstract = {Chemical evolution models are powerful tools for interpreting stellar abundance surveys and understanding galaxy evolution. However, their predictions depend heavily on the treatment of inflow, outflow, star formation efficiency (SFE), the stellar initial mass function, the SN Ia delay time distribution, stellar yields, and stellar population mixing. Using flexCE, a flexible one-zone chemical evolution code, we investigate the effects of and trade-offs between parameters. Two critical parameters are SFE and the outflow mass-loading parameter, which shift the knee in [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] and the equilibrium abundances that the simulations asymptotically approach, respectively. One-zone models with simple star formation histories follow narrow tracks in [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] unlike the observed bimodality (separate high-α and low-α sequences) in this plane. A mix of one-zone models with inflow timescale and outflow mass-loading parameter variations, motivated by the inside-out galaxy formation scenario with radial mixing, reproduces the two sequences better than a one-zone model with two infall epochs. We present [X/Fe]–[Fe/H] tracks for 20 elements assuming three different supernova yield models and find some significant discrepancies with solar neighborhood observations, especially for elements with strongly metallicity-dependent yields. We apply principal component abundance analysis to the simulations and existing data to reveal the main correlations among abundances and quantify their contributions to variation in abundance space. For the stellar population mixing scenario, the abundances of α-elements and elements with metallicity-dependent yields dominate the first and second principal components, respectively, and collectively explain 99\% of the variance in the model. flexCE is a python package available at https://github.com/bretthandrews/flexCE.}

    abstract = "{We present a method for extracting actions, angles and frequencies from an orbit's time series. The method recovers the generating function that maps an analytic phase-space torus to the torus to which the orbit is confined by simultaneously solving the constraints provided by each time step. We test the method by recovering the actions and frequencies of tori in a triaxial Stäckel potential, and use it to investigate the structure of orbits in a triaxial potential that has been fitted to our Galaxy's Sagittarius stream. The method promises to be useful for analysing N-body simulations. It also takes a step towards constructing distribution functions for the triaxial components of our Galaxy, such as the bar and dark halo.}",

    abstract = "{We review the available methods for estimating actions, angles and frequencies of orbits in both axisymmetric and triaxial potentials. The methods are separated into two classes. Unless an orbit has been trapped by a resonance, convergent, or iterative, methods are able to recover the actions to arbitrarily high accuracy given sufficient computing time. Faster non-convergent methods rely on the potential being sufficiently close to a separable potential, and the accuracy of the action estimate cannot be improved through further computation. We critically compare the accuracy of the methods and the required computation time for a range of orbits in an axisymmetric multicomponent Galactic potential. We introduce a new method for estimating actions that builds on the adiabatic approximation of Schönrich \\&amp; Binney and discuss the accuracy required for the actions, angles and frequencies using suitable distribution functions for the thin and thick discs, the stellar halo and a star stream. We conclude that for studies of the disc and smooth halo component of the Milky Way, the most suitable compromise between speed and accuracy is the Stäckel Fudge, whilst when studying streams the non-convergent methods do not offer sufficient accuracy and the most suitable method is computing the actions from an orbit integration via a generating function.

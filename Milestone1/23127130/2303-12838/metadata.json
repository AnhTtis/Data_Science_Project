    "abstract": "All galaxies are formed within dark matter halos, the nature of which is yet to be understood. The circular velocity curve, one of the first pieces of evidence for dark matter, is a direct probe of the Galaxy's potential, which allows studies of the nature of these dark matter halos. Recent large surveys have provided valuable information for determining the Milky Way circular velocity curve. In this study, we derive precise parallaxes for 120,309 stars with a data-driven model, using APOGEE DR17 spectra combined with photometry measurements from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE. We measure the circular velocity curve of the Milky Way out to $\\sim 30$ kpc, and use it to provide an updated model of the dark matter density profile. We find a significantly faster decline in the circular velocity curve at outer galactic radii. To address this decline, we find that a cored Einasto profile with slope parameter $1.13^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ is a better fit to the data than a generalized or contracted Navarro-Frank-White (NFW), as was argued in previous studies. The virial mass of the best-fit dark matter halo is $1.50^{+0.04}_{-0.04}\\times10^{11}$ $M_{\\odot}$, significantly lower than that from a generalized NFW profile, but the corresponding local dark matter density at the solar position is $0.425^{+0.004}_{-0.004}$ GeV cm$^{-3}$, consistent with the literature. We additionally find the $J$-factor for annihilating dark matter at a 15$^{\\circ}$ view angle towards the galactic centre is $9.96^{+0.64}_{-0.57}\\times10^{22}$ GeV$^{2}$ cm$^{-5}$, $\\sim 8\\%$ of the value found from a standard NFW profile used in the literature. Our results further demonstrate the capability of the circular velocity curve, especially in light of the recent wave of data, in constraining the Milky Way's dark matter halo.",

    "abstract": "We have studied the ground state properties of Hubbard model on long six-leg square cylinders with doped hole concentration per site $5.55\\% \\leq δ\\leq 12.5\\%$ using density-matrix renormalization group. By keeping a large number of states for long system sizes, we find that the nature of the ground state is remarkably sensitive to the presence of next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t'$. In the positive $t'$ side, we find a robust $d$-wave superconducting (SC) phase characterized by coexisting quasi-long-range SC and charge density wave (CDW) correlations. Without $t'$ the ground state forms an insulating stripe phase with long-range CDW order but short-range spin-spin and SC correlations. In stark contrast to four-leg cylinders, our results show that the lightly doped Hubbard model on six-leg cylinders remains insulating in the negative $t'$ side where the SC correlations decay exponentially with short correlation lengths. In the larger negative $t'$ side, the doped holes form a novel holon Wigner crystal with one doped hole per emergent unit cell and short-range spin-spin correlations.",

    "abstract": "Establishing the fundamental relation between the homotopy invariants and the band topology of Hamiltonians has played a critical role in the recent development of topological phase research. In this work, we establish the homotopy invariant and the related band topology of three-dimensional (3D) real-valued Hamiltonians with two occupied and two unoccupied bands. Such a real Hamiltonian generally appears in $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric spinless fermion systems where $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ indicate the inversion and time-reversal symmetries, respectively. We show that the 3D band topology of the system is characterized by two independent Hopf invariants when the lower-dimensional band topology is trivial. Thus, the corresponding 3D band insulator with nonzero Hopf invariants can be called a real Hopf insulator (RHI). In sharp contrast to all the other topological insulators discovered up to now, the topological invariants of RHI can be defined only when both the occupied and unoccupied states are simultaneously considered. Thus, the RHI belongs to the category of delicate topological insulators proposed recently. We show that finite-size systems with slab geometry support surface states with nonzero Chern numbers in a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric manner, and establish the bulk-boundary correspondence. We also discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence of rotation symmetric RHIs using the returning Thouless pump.",

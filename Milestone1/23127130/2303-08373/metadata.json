    "abstract": "In this work we report on the emergence of a novel type of solitary waves, viz., time-localized solitons in integrable and non-integrable variants of the massive Thirring models and in the three-wave resonant-interaction system, which are models broadly used in plasmas, nonlinear optics and hydrodynamics. An essential finding is that the condition for the existence of time-localized dark solitons, which develop density dips in the course of time evolution, in these models coincides with the condition for the occurrence of the zero-wavenumber-gain (ZWG) modulational instability (MI). Systematic simulations reveal that, whenever the ZWG MI is present, patterns reminiscent of such solitons are generically excited from a chaotic background field as fragments within more complex patterns.",

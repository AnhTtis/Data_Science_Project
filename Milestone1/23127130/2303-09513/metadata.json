    "abstract": "For $d > 0$, define $G(\\mathbb{Q}^3, d)$ to be the graph whose set of vertices is the rational space $\\mathbb{Q}^3$, where two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are a Euclidean distance $d$ apart. Let $χ(\\mathbb{Q}^3, d)$ be the chromatic number of such a graph or, in other words, the minimum number of colors needed to color the points of $\\mathbb{Q}^3$ so that no two points at distance $d$ apart receive the same color. An open problem, originally posed by Benda and Perles in the 1970s, asks if there exists $d$ such that $χ(\\mathbb{Q}^3, d) = 3$. Through numerous efforts over the years, $χ(\\mathbb{Q}^3, d)$ has been determined for many values of $d$, and for all those distances $d$ where $χ(\\mathbb{Q}^3, d)$ has not been exactly pinned down, it is known that $χ(\\mathbb{Q}^3, d) \\in \\{3,4\\}$. In our work, we detail several search algorithms we have employed to find $4$-chromatic subgraphs of various graphs $G(\\mathbb{Q}^3, d)$ whose chromatic number was previously unknown. Ultimately, we conjecture that no $3$-chromatic $G(\\mathbb{Q}^3, d)$ exists. Along the way, we pose a few related questions that we feel are of interest in their own right.",

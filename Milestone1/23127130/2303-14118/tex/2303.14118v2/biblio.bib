abstract = {The simulation of molecules is a widely anticipated application of quantum computers. However, recent studies [1, 2] have cast a shadow on this hope by revealing that the complexity in gate count of such simulations increases with the number of spin orbitals N as N8, which becomes prohibitive even for molecules of modest size N ∼ 100. This study was partly based on a scaling analysis of the Trotter step required for an ensemble of random artificial molecules. Here, we revisit this analysis and find instead that the scaling is closer to N6 in worst case for real model molecules we have studied, indicating that the random ensemble fails to accurately capture the statistical properties of real-world molecules. Actual scaling may be significantly better than this due to averaging effects. We then present an alternative simulation scheme and show that it can sometimes outperform existing schemes, but that this possibility depends crucially on the details of the simulated molecule. We obtain further improvements using a version of the coalescing scheme of [1]; this scheme is based on using different Trotter steps for different terms. The method we use to bound the complexity of simulating a given molecule is efficient, in contrast to the approach of [1, 2] which relied on exponentially costly classical exact simulation.},

abstract = {Simulation of the Hubbard model is a leading candidate for the first useful applications of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A recent study of quantum algorithms for early simulations of the Hubbard model [Kivlichan et al 2019 Quantum 4 296] found that the lowest resource costs were achieved by split-operator Trotterization combined with the fast-fermionic Fourier transform (FFFT) on an L × L lattice with length L = 2 k . On lattices with length L ≠ 2 k , Givens rotations can be used instead of the FFFT but lead to considerably higher resource costs. We present a new analytic approach to bounding the simulation error due to Trotterization that provides much tighter bounds for the split-operator FFFT method, leading to 16× improvement in error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce plaquette Trotterization that works on any size lattice and apply our improved error bound analysis to show competitive resource costs. We consider a phase estimation task and show plaquette Trotterization reduces the number of non-Clifford gates by a factor 5.5× to 9× (depending on the parameter regime) over the best previous estimates for 8 × 8 and 16 × 16 lattices and a much larger factor for other lattice sizes not of the form L = 2 k . In conclusion, we find there is a potentially useful application for fault-tolerant quantum computers using around one million Toffoli gates.}

abstract={Modeling low energy eigenstates of fermionic systems can provide insight into chemical reactions and material properties and is one of the most anticipated applications of quantum computing. We present three techniques for reducing the cost of preparing fermionic Hamiltonian eigenstates using phase estimation. First, we report a polylogarithmic-depth quantum algorithm for antisymmetrizing the initial states required for simulation of fermions in first quantization. This is an exponential improvement over the previous state-of-the-art. Next, we show how to reduce the overhead due to repeated state preparation in phase estimation when the goal is to prepare the ground state to high precision and one has knowledge of an upper bound on the ground state energy that is less than the excited state energy (often the case in quantum chemistry). Finally, we explain how one can perform the time evolution necessary for the phase estimation based preparation of Hamiltonian eigenstates with exactly zero error by using the recently introduced qubitization procedure.},

abstract = {We propose the first near-optimal quantum algorithm for estimating in Euclidean norm the mean of a vector-valued random variable with finite mean and covariance. Our result aims at extending the theory of multivariate sub-Gaussian estimators [Lugosi and Mendelson, 2019] to the quantum setting. Unlike classically, where any univariate estimator can be turned into a multivariate estimator with at most a logarithmic overhead in the dimension, no similar result can be proved in the quantum setting. Indeed, [Heinrich, 2004] ruled out the existence of a quantum advantage for the mean estimation problem when the sample complexity is smaller than the dimension. Our main result is to show that, outside this low-precision regime, there does exist a quantum estimator that outperforms any classical estimator. More precisely, we prove that the approximation error can be decreased by a factor of about the square root of the ratio between the dimension and the sample complexity. Our approach is substantially more involved than in the univariate setting, where most quantum estimators rely only on phase estimation. We exploit a variety of additional algorithmic techniques such as linear amplitude amplification, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, and quantum singular value transformation. Our analysis is also deeply rooted in proving concentration inequalities for multivariate truncated statistics. Finally, we describe several applications of our algorithms, notably in measuring the expectation values of commuting observables and in the field of machine learning.},

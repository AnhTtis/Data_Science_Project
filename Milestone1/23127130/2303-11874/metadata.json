    "abstract": "This paper is devoted to a rigorous derivation of the isentropic Euler-alignment system with singular communication weights $φ_α(x) = |x|^{-α}$ for some $α> 0$. We consider a kinetic BGK-alignment model consisting of a kinetic BGK-type equation with a singular Cucker-Smale alignment force. By taking into account a small relaxation parameter, which corresponds to the asymptotic regime of a strong effect from BGK operator, we quantitatively derive the isentropic Euler-alignment system with pressure $p(ρ) = ρ^γ$, $γ= 1 + \\frac2d$ from that kinetic equation.",

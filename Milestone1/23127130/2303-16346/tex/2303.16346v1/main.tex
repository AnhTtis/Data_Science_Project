\begin{abstract}
%Low vision people face challenges in reading tasks. While large font and screen magnifiers can enable them to read, low vision people suffer from slow and unpleasant reading experiences, for example, they can easily lose track of the next line with high magnification. Eye tracking technique has the potential to advance low vision technology by recognizing people's fine-grained gaze behaviors and providing more targeted enhancements. 
%To inspire gaze-based low vision technology, we aim to explore the feasibility of commercial eye trackers for low vision users, and investigate their gaze patterns during reading via eye tracking. A more accessible gaze calibration interface was designed to make the eye tracker more usable to low vision people. We collected the gaze data of 12 low vision participants and 12 sighted controls when they performed reading tasks on a computer screen. We also asked low vision participants to read with different types of screen magnifiers (e.g., lens or full-screen magnifier) to investigate the effect of different magnification modes on users' gaze behaviors.  We found that, with accessible calibration interfaces and suitable data collection, commercial eye trackers can be promising tools for low vision research. Our study also identified unique gaze patterns of low vision people during reading, based upon which, we propose guidelines for gaze-based assistive technology design.

While being able to read with screen magnifiers, low vision people have slow and unpleasant reading experiences.
Eye tracking has the potential to improve their experience by recognizing fine-grained gaze behaviors and providing more targeted enhancements. To inspire gaze-based low vision technology, we \change{investigate the suitable method to collect low vision users' gaze data via commercial eye trackers and thoroughly explore their challenges in reading based on their gaze behaviors}. With an improved calibration interface, we collected the gaze data of \change{20 low vision participants and 20 sighted controls} who performed reading tasks on a computer screen; low vision participants were also asked to read with different screen magnifiers. We found that, with an accessible calibration interface and data collection method, commercial eye trackers can \change{collect gaze data of comparable quality from low vision and sighted people.} Our study identified low vision people’s unique gaze patterns during reading, building upon which, we propose design implications for gaze-based low vision technology.

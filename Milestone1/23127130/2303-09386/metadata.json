    "abstract": "This paper deals with a class of nonlinear anisotropic parabolic equations with degenerate coercivity. Using the anisotropic Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type inequality, we prove some existence and regularity results for the solutions under the framework of anisotropic Sobolev spaces, which generalize the previous results of [10,18,23].",

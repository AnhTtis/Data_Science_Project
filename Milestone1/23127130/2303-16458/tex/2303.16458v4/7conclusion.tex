\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes a W2PGNN framework to answer the question of \emph{when to pre-train} GNNs based on the generative mechanisms from pre-training to downstream data. 
W2PGNN designs a graphon-based graph generator to summarize the knowledge in pre-training data, and the generator can in turn produce the solution space of downstream data that can benefit from the pre-training.
W2PGNN is theoretically and empirically shown to have great potential to provide the application scope of graph pre-training models, estimate the feasibility of pre-training and help select pre-training data.

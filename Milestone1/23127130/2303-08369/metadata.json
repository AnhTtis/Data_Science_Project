    "abstract": "(MnNiSi)1-(Fe2Ge)x composition (x=0.34) alloy was prepared by arc melting, crushed, and sieved to approximately <32 microns. They were utilized in examining the possible magnetic and structural changes when exposed to a dosage of a continuous sweeping rate of ~>120 Gy/min and an absorbed dose of 35 kGy of X-ray radiation. This study reports observable trends in X-ray diffraction and magnetic measurements. Magnetization in the magnetization vs. temperature (both heating and cooling) measurements showed an increase from 2.72 emu/g to 4.01 emu/g in the irradiated sample. The Magnetization vs. magnetic field loops exhibited irradiation-induced magnetic hysteresis. The irradiated sample also exhibited an observable change in its coercivity of ΔHc = 14.7% at 200 K. A maximum entropy change ΔSmag of ~ 11.139 J/kg*K and a Tave peak of 317.5 K was achieved for the pristine sample in comparison to ΔSmag of ~ 11.349 J/kg*K and a Tave peak of 312.5 K for the irradiated sample. These presented results provided deeper insights into tuning the effect of irradiation to the magnetic properties of (MnNiSi)1-(Fe2Ge)x for composition (x=0.34) that can be utilized in a wide range of magnetocaloric applications in high-energy radiation environments. The irradiation applied to the sample did not induce any structural or magnetic phase changes in the selected composition but modified the magnetic properties marginally.",

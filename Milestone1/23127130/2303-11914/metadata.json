    "abstract": "Steering is one of the three inequivalent forms of nonlocal correlations intermediate between Bell nonlocality and entanglement. Schrodinger-Robertson uncertainty relation (SRUR), has been widely used to detect entanglement and steering. However, the steering criterion in earlier works, based on SRUR, did not involve complete inferred variance uncertainty relation. In this paper, by considering the local hidden state model and Reids formalism, we derive a complete inferred-variance EPR-steering criterion based on SRUR in the bipartite scenario. Furthermore, we check the effectiveness of our steering criterion to discrete variable bipartite two qubit, two qutrit and two ququart isotropic states.",

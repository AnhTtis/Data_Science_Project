    "abstract": "Dissipaton theory had been proposed as an exact and nonperturbative approach to deal with open quantum system dynamics, where the influence of Gaussian environment is characterized by statistical quasi-particles named as dissipatons. In this work, we revisit the dissipaton equation of motion theory and establish an equivalent dissipatons-embedded quantum master equation (DQME), which gives rise to dissipatons as generalized Brownian particles. As explained in this work, the DQME supplies a direct approach to investigate the statistical characteristics of dissipatons and thus the physically supporting hybrid bath modes. Numerical demonstrations are carried out on the electron transfer model, exhibiting the transient statistical properties of the solvation coordinate.",

    "abstract": "Previous gate-dependent conductance measurements of metallic carbon nanotubes have revealed unexplainable conductance suppressions, occurring at two different gate voltages. These were previously attributed to the gate-dependency of contact resistance. Our gate-dependent conductivity measurements on a metallic nanotube with known chirality show that these bimodal conductance suppressions are the manifestations of Wigner cusps, often seen in atomic and nuclear physics experiments.",

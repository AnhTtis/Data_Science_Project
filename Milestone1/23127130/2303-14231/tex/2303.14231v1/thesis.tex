\begin{thesisabstract}  
 
  This thesis develops the categorical proof theory for the non-compact multiplicative dagger ($\dagger$) linear logic, 
  and investigates its applications to Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM). 
   
  The existing frameworks of CQM are categorical proof theories of compact $\dagger$-linear logic, and
  are motivated by the interpretation of quantum systems in the category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
  This thesis describes a new non-compact framework called Mixed Unitary Categories which can 
  accommodate infinite dimensional systems, and develops models for the framework. To this end, it builds 
  on linearly distributive categories, and $*$-autonomous categories which are categorical proof theories 
  of (non-compact) multiplicative linear logic. The proof theory of non-compact $\dagger$-linear logic is 
  obtained from the basic setting of an LDC by adding a dagger functor satisfying appropriate coherences 
  to give a $\dagger$-LDC.
   
  From every (isomix) $\dagger$-LDC one can extract a canonical ``unitary core'' which up to equivalence is the traditional 
  CQM framework of $\dagger$-monoidal categories. This leads to the framework of Mixed Unitary Categories (MUCs):  
  every MUC contains a (compact) unitary core which is extended by a (non-compact) isomix $\dagger$-LDC. 
  Various models of MUCs based on Finiteness Spaces, Chu spaces, Hopf modules, etc., are developed in this thesis. 
  This thesis also generalizes the key algebraic structures of CQM, such as observables, measurement, and 
  complementarity, to MUC framework. Furthermore, using the MUC framework, this thesis establishes a 
  connection between the complementary observables of quantum mechanics and the exponential modalities of linear logic.

  \chapter{Acknowledgements}  
  
  I thank my supervisor Dr. Robin Cockett for the trust he placed in me even though 
  I was not a mathematician and had no clue about Category Theory when I joined his group. 
  I am eternally grateful for his unwavering support and patience in helping me refine my {\em art of learning}, 
  and, dually, {\em my art of teaching}. I am also grateful to him for providing an inclusive, safe and a comfortable
  environment for me to learn Mathematics and to do research. Thank you, Robin, 
  for all the proofs we worked out over a cup of tea and the group hikes.

  I am thankful to Jonathan, my friend, for the countless hours he spent in teaching 
  me Category Theory and helping me write proofs  in the initial days of my Ph.D., without 
  which this journey would not have been possible. Thank you, Jonathan!
  
 I thank my co-supervisor Dr. Gilad Gour for his patience and kind support 
 throughout my degree. I thank Dr. Kristine Bauer for her support as my interim supervisor 
 during Dr. Cockett's sabbatical and for all the fun conversations 
 we shared during the weekly seminars and symposiums. 
 I thank Dr. Renate Scheidler for her excellent mentorship during 
 the practicum of my SAGES teaching certification. I thank Dr. Jalal Kawash 
 for the kind guidance I received as his teaching assistant.  I thank Dr. Barry Sanders 
 for the financial support he provided me during the first three years of my degree. 
  I thank Dr. Bob Coecke, Dr. Jamie Vicary,  and Dr. Chris Heunen for hosting me at  the 
  University of Oxford and at the University of Edinburgh during my Mitacs Globallink internship. 
 I thank my examiners Dr. Peter Selinger, Dr. Philipp Woelfel, Dr. Carlo Maria Scandolo, and
 Dr. Kristine Bauer immensely for their time and effort in reading my thesis, and their feedback. 
 
 I thank my friend and colleague Jean Simon Lemay (JS) for many examples 
 in this thesis, and for making my research visit to Oxford quite enjoyable. Thank you, JS, 
 for lending me your bicycle during the visit! Thank you, Jonathan, Amolak, JS, and Ben for proof-reading 
 my thesis. Thank you, Cole, for the fun and successful collaborations on the CNOT and the dagger linear logic papers.
 A big thanks to all my colleagues, in the past and in the present, from Dr. Cockett's and Dr. Gour's 
 group for all the enlightening conversations and support. It was an honour for me to work with you all. 

A ton of thanks to my friends, for making me feel home in Calgary and for all the beautiful memories - 
 Sunday afternoons at coffee shops, night walks at the Confederation park, dumpling parties, 
 road trip to Okanagan, hiking in the Rockies, hot tea, home-made delicacies, shared lunch, 
 weeding bees, and many more. I thank all my overseas friends for being there for me over Skype 
 and other mediums whenever I was in need of you. 

 Many thanks to Maryam, Jackie, and Katie at the front office of the Computer Science Department  
 for providing excellent administrative support throughout my degree, and for their gentle smile 
 whenever I turned up at their desk with a request. 

Last, but most of all, I thank my family for their extra-ordinary support, 
and encouragement in all my endeavors, and for making possible this 
first ever doctorate degree in my family tree.

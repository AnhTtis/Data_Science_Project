\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{conclusion}
In this work, we show that  PORE can turn an arbitrary base recommender system algorithm to be provably robust against data poisoning attacks via ensembling multiple base recommender systems built by the base algorithm on random subsamples of the rating-score matrix. 
Our ensemble recommender system guarantees a certain fraction of its top-$N$ items recommended to a user \neil{is} unaffected by fake users no matter how the attacker crafts their rating scores. Our empirical evaluation confirms that our ensemble recommender system provides provable robustness guarantees. Interesting future work includes deriving better provable robustness guarantees by bounding the number of items that fake users can rate and incorporating the knowledge of the base recommender system algorithm as well as deriving provable robustness guarantees against targeted data poisoning attacks.

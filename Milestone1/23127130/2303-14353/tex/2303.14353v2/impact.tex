\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper presents work that leverages diffusion models. Diffusion models are powerful generative models capable of synthesizing highly realistic images that can be difficult to distinguish from real photographs. Such techniques can be abused by bad actors to fabricate misinformation or otherwise misleading content. Moreover, deep learning-based image reconstruction algorithms are known to hallucinate, that is output features that appear realistic but are inconsistent with the ground truth. Therefore, it is imperative to practice an abundance of caution when deploying such techniques in safety-critical applications.

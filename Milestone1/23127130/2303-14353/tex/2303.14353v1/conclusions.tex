\section{Conclusions and limitations}
In this paper, we propose a novel framework for solving inverse problems based on reversing a stochastic degradation process. Our solver can flexibly trade off perceptual image quality for more traditional distortion metrics and sampling speedup. Moreover, we show both theoretically and empirically that our method maintains consistency with the measurement throughout the reconstruction process. Our method produces reconstructions of exceptional quality in terms of both perceptual and distortion-based metrics, surpassing comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple high-resolution datasets and image restoration tasks. The main limitation of our method is that a model needs to be trained from scratch for each inverse problem, whereas other diffusion-based solvers can leverage standard score networks trained via denoising score matching. Incorporating pre-trained score models into our framework for improved speed and reconstruction quality is an interesting direction for future work.

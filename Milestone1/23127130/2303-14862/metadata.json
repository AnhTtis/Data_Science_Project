    "abstract": "We propose a new derivation of Time-Independent Perturbation Theory (PT) that has a fundamental advantage over the usual derivations presented in textbooks on Quantum Mechanics (QM): it is simpler and much shorter. As such, it can provide an easier and quicker way for students to learn PT, than afforded by current methods. In spite of that, our approach does not require the potentials to be energy independent or the inverse free Green function $G_0^{-1}(E)$ to be a linear function of energy $E$, as is the case in QM, and can be applied directly to various extensions of QM including Relativistic QM, the Bethe-Salpeter equation, and all kinds of quasipotential approaches in Quantum Field Theory.",

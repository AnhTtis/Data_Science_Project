    "abstract": "The National Vulnerability Disclosure Database is an invaluable source of information for security professionals and researchers. However, in some cases, a vulnerability report is initially published with incomplete information, a situation that complicates incident response and mitigation. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of vulnerabilities that are initially submitted with an incomplete report, and present key findings related to their frequency, nature, and the time needed to update them. We further present a novel ticketing process that is tailored to addressing the problems related to such vulnerabilities and demonstrate the use of this system with a real-life use case.",

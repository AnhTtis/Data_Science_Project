    "abstract": "Causal multiteam semantics is a framework where probabilistic dependencies arising from data and causation between variables can be together formalized and studied logically. We consider several logics in the setting of causal multiteam semantics that can express probability comparisons concerning formulae and constants, and encompass interventionist counterfactuals and selective implications that describe consequences of actions and consequences of learning from observations, respectively. We discover complete characterizations of expressivity of the logics in terms of families of linear equations that define the corresponding classes of causal multiteams (together with some closure conditions). The characterizations yield a strict hierarchy of expressive power. Finally, we present some undefinability results based on the characterizations.",

    "abstract": "Taking advantage of recent progress in neutron instrumentation and in the understanding of magnetic-field-dependent small-angle neutron scattering, here, we study the three-dimensional magnetization distribution within an isotropic Nd-Fe-B bulk magnet. The magnetic neutron scattering cross section of this system features the so-called spike anisotropy, which points towards the presence of a strong magnetodipolar interaction. This experimental result combined with a damped oscillatory behavior of the corresponding correlation function and recent micromagnetic simulation results on spherical nanoparticles suggest an interpretation of the neutron data in terms of vortex-like flux closure patterns. The field-dependent correlation length is very well reproduced by a power-law model used to describe the London penetration depth in the vortex state of type-II superconductors and suggests the 'pairing' (interaction) of magnetic vortices.",

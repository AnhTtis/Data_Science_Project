    "abstract": "Taking advantage of the fact that the cardinalities of hidden variables in network scenarios can be assumed to be finite without loss of generality, a numerical tool for finding explicit local models that reproduce a given statistical behaviour was developed. The numerical procedure was then validated using families of statistical behaviours for which the network-local boundary is known, in the bilocal scenario. Furthermore, the critical visibility for 3 notable distributions mixed with a uniform random noise is investigated in the triangle network without inputs. We provide conjectures for the critical visibilities of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W distributions (which are roots of 4th degree polynomials), as well as a lower bound estimate of the critical visibility of the Elegant Joint Measurement distribution. The developed codes and documentation are publicly available at github.com/mariofilho281/localmodels",

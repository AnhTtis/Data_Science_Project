    "abstract": "The radio jets of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can heat up the gas around a host galaxy and quench star formation activity. The presence of a radio jet could be related to the evolutionary path of the host galaxy and may be imprinted in the morphology and kinematics of the galaxy. In this work, we use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two-Metre Sky Survey as well as the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeter survey. We combine these integral field spectroscopic data and radio data to study the link between stellar kinematics and radio AGNs. We find that the luminosity-weighted stellar angular momentum $λ_{Re}$ is tightly related to the range of radio luminosity and the fraction of radio AGNs F radio present in galaxies, as high-luminosity radio AGNs are only in galaxies with a small $λ_{Re}$, and the $F_{radio}$ at a fixed stellar mass decreases with $λ_{Re}$. These results indicate that galaxies with stronger random stellar motions with respect to the ordered motions might be better breeding grounds for powerful radio AGNs. This would also imply that the merger events of galaxies are important in the triggering of powerful radio jets in our sample.",

    "abstract": "Models that postulate the existence of hidden sectors address contemporary questions, such as the source of baryogenesis and the nature of dark matter. Among the possible mixing processes, neutron-to-hidden-neutron oscillations have been repeatedly tested with ultra-cold neutron storage and passing-through-wall experiments in the range of small ($δm<2$ peV) and large mass splitting ($δm>10$ neV), respectively. In this work, we present a new constraint in the oscillation parameter space derived from neutron disappearance in ultra-cold neutron beam experiments. The overall limit, which covers the intermediate mass-splitting range, is given by $τ_{nn'}> 1$ s for $|δm| \\in [2,69]$ peV (95\\% C.L.).",

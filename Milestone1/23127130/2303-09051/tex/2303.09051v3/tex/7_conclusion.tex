\section{Conclusion}
Throughout the paper, we first analyze the current evaluation methods for diffusion-based adversarial purification and then propose a recommendation for the reliable evaluation of the robustness of adversarial purification. We further investigate the influence of hyperparameters of the diffusion model on the robustness of the purification. Based on our analysis, we propose a new strategy to maximize the benefit of the purification methods.

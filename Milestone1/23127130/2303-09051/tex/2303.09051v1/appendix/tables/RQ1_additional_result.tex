    \caption{Robust accuracy of DiffPure~\citep{Nie2022DiffusionMF} and its probability flow ODE against PGD+EOT $\ell_\infty(\epsilon = 8/255)$ on CIFAR-10. We compare the attack success rate between the adjoint method and back-propagation. The gradient of the full or surrogate process is calculated by back-propagation. The maximum timestep $t^*$ is set to 0.1. The step size of DiffPure and probability flow ODE in defense is 0.001 and 0.01, respectively.}

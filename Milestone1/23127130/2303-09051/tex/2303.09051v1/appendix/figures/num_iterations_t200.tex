    The number of purification steps in defense and its influence on the standard and robust accuracy against PGD+EOT $\ell_\infty (\epsilon = 8/255)$ on CIFAR-10. The number of forward steps is 200 (i.e., $t^* = 200$). The reported robust accuracy is the lowest performance among the various number of purification steps in the attacks.}

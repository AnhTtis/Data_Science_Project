    \caption{The number of purification steps during defenses and its influence on the robust accuracy against PGD+EOT $\ell_\infty (\epsilon = 8/255)$. We compare the attack success rate with respect to the number of purification steps during attacks. The number of forward steps of the top two rows is 100, and the number of forward steps of the bottom two rows is 200.}

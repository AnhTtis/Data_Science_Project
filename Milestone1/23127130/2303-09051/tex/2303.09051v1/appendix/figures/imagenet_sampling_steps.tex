    \caption{Robust accuracy as we change the number of denoising steps against PGD+EOT $\ell_\infty (\epsilon = 4/255)$ on ImageNet. We change the number of denoising steps in (a) defense, (b) both, and (c) attack for each experiment when the other hyperparameters are fixed. The number of forward steps is 200 (i.e., $t^* = 200$).}

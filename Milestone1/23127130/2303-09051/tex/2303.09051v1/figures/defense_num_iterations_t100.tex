    The number of purification steps in defense and its influence to the standard and robust accuracy against PGD+EOT $\ell_\infty (\epsilon = 8/255)$ on CIFAR-10. The number of forward steps is 100 (i.e., $t^* = 100$). The reported robust accuracy is the lowest performance of all settings of the number of purification steps of the attack.}

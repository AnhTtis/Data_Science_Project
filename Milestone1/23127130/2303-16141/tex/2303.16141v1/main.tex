\begin{abstract}

Deep learning is effective in diagnosing COVID-19 and requires a large amount of data to be effectively trained. Due to data and privacy regulations,  hospitals generally have no access to data from other hospitals. Federated learning (FL) has been used to solve this problem, where it utilizes a distributed setting to train models in hospitals in a privacy-preserving manner. Deploying FL is not always feasible as it requires high computation and
network communication resources. This paper evaluates five FL algorithms' performance and resource efficiency for Covid-19 detection. 
A decentralized setting with CNN networks is set up, and the performance of FL algorithms is compared with a centralized environment. We examined the algorithms with varying numbers of participants, federated rounds, and selection algorithms.

Our results show that cyclic weight transfer can have better overall performance, and results are better with fewer participating hospitals. Our results demonstrate good performance for detecting COVID-19 patients and might be useful in deploying FL algorithms for covid-19
detection and medical image analysis in general.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{ C}oronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause respiratory and intestinal illnesses in humans and animals. The best-known variants are those responsible for the COVID-19, SARS, and MERS epidemics. Some people with COVID-19 will develop serious complications including COVID pneumonia, which can be recognized in lung CT scans. Research has shown the effectiveness of chest imaging in diagnosing COVID-19-infected people. Deep learning methods, such as Convolutional neural networks (CNN), can help radiologists diagnose COVID-19 with severe symptoms in various image analysis tasks\cite{kogilavani2022covid}.
For Covid-19 deep learning, models have shown great promise in spotting infected areas in CT scans and X-ray images. 

The training of deep learning models requires sufficient and diverse medical datasets gathered from multiple data holders. And most of the existing solutions rely on a central entity in charge of collecting data from different hospitals. However, medical images may contain confidential and sensitive information about patients that often cannot be shared outside the institutions of their origin. One potential solution to this problem is federated deep learning. FL aims to decentralize the whole process of training by keeping the data locally. In FL, the algorithm training is performed in a decentralized manner by different nodes, or clients, that use local data. In this scenario, each decentralized node
trains an individual model using its data and shares the model parameters (instead of the data) with the rest.
% the distributed computation and develpmoent of deep learning models ensure the accumulation of knowledge and reaching the full capacity of deep learning models.

FL can differ from centralized data sharing in a number of ways. While both approaches aim to optimize their learning objective, FL algorithms have to account for the fact that communication with clients takes place over unreliable networks with very limited upload speeds. So unlike 
the centralized setting in which computation is generally a bottleneck, in FL communication might be the bottleneck. 

In this paper, we developed a framework that enables collaboration between hospitals and uses multiple data sources to detect COVID-19 infection using FL
The decentralized way of distributing data among different centers guarantees privacy and data is kept locally\cite{darzidehkalanifederatedII}.




% There are several ways of doing federated learning since federated learning is performed in a higher level compared to conventional deep learning. There are more parameters of complexity since the model should take into consideration the general and local methods of optimization, data accumulation for all the sites, and local training models. 
% There are several parameters playing a role in the final performance of a federated learning setting.

 





% It can be spread by human-human interaction. There are several waus tp diagnose COVID-19. Transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test are one of the most common ways of diagnosing COVID-19. However, there are other ways of diagnosing COVID-19 \cite{rubin2020role}
% However, due to large number of people having the symptoms and being tested for COVID-19, it might not always be feasible for radiologists to examine large number of patients during the outbreak. Scans of CT and Xray of infected patients have sorts of deformation, misalignment between certain parts, or have pixel intensities different than normal people in infected parts. Observing this misalignment in not an easy task and requires effort and focus from radiologist to correctly distringuish betweeen healthy and infected people. 
% Instead, 
% Various architectures of CNN have been tested  and shown a great performance on the imaging datasets. Models such as AlexNet \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}
%  ResNet \cite{he2016deep}  and MobileNet \cite{howard2017mobilenets} could classify thousands of objects belonging to hundreds of classes with the same accuracy as human.
 



% It has also been used to detect COVID-19 from imaging data. Most of the usecases were either for Xray like the researches in 
% While CT scans can help screen COVID-19 potential infected people, CT scans of other diseases could also have overlapping features with COVID ingected patients. Hence, it is tricky to distinguish COVID infected patients from other types of lung inflammation and requires radiologists level experrtise. The most literature focuses on the ways to better distirnguish COVID infected patients from other diseases, as can be seen in [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].

  abstract  = {{The book by A. C. Antoulas presents a comprehensive treatise on the approximation and model reduction of large-scale linear control systems, i.e. the systems whose state space dimensionality is much bigger than $10^3$. Systems of this type arise in modeling of many both natural as well as artificial systems, including image processing, VLSI circuits, MEMS, space station modules, chemical reactors, weather prediction, air quality models, various biological systems, etc. Due to the very high complexity of these models, the only way of understanding the represented by them phenomena leads through the model reduction that consists in replacing the complex original model by a simplified and computationally tractable approximant. This book's main objective has been to present the problems and techniques of the model reduction for large-scale linear systems. A basic common ingredient of all these model reduction techniques is a concept of the projection from the high dimensional state space of the original system to the state space the approximant. Whenever possible, the quality of the approximant is estimated using the Hankel norms of the associated transfer function. The choice of the projection usually involves infinite Gramians or reachability/observability subspaces of the original system. The model reduction techniques studied in the book belong either to the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or to the Krylov methods. The SVD methods include the balanced truncation, the Hankel norm approximation, and the proper orthogonal decomposition. Their advantages is the preservation of stability of the original system and the proved approximation error bound, however still high computational complexity restricts the applicability of SVD methods to systems of dimension not exceeding $10^3$. The Krylov methods (Lanczos and Arnoldi) have iterative character that makes them computationally more efficient, and applicable to systems whose dimensions are much higher than $10^3$. A fusion of SVD and Krylov techniques is suggested as a means of retaining the advantages of both of them. The treatise is divided into 5 parts that consist of 15 chapters, the Foreword written by J. C. Willems, the Preface, the list of notations, the 373 item Bibliography, and the Index. Below we make a quick overview of the book's contents. Part I of the book (chapters 1-2) presents general ideas of and a motivation for the model reduction. Part II (chapters 3-6) introduces the fundamentals of matrix theory and linear control systems, with special focus on controllability, observability, system realization and interpolation, system norms, Hankel operator, system stability and dissipativity as well as Lyapunov and Sylvester equations. Part III (chapters 7-9) is devoted to SVD model reduction methods. The method and algorithms of balanced truncation is presented in chapter 7. Chapter 8 deals with the optimal and suboptimal model approximation in the Hankel norm. The proper orthogonal decomposition and the modal approximation methods are discussed in chapter 9. Part IV of the book is concerned with the Krylov methods. The motivation, the main idea of the Krylov iterations, and the Lanczos and Arnoldi algorithms are described in chapter 10. Chapter 11 presents an application of the Krylov methods to the system approximation by moment matching. The leitmotif of Part V (chapters 12-15) of the book is a connection between SVD and Krylov methods. Specifically, chapter 12 contains a discussion of this connection and brings in a method of approximation by least squares that combines some features of SVD and Krylov methods. Chapter 13 presents several case studies in the model reduction, including a 2D image approximation, a model of a building, models of two modules of the International Space Station, a structural model of an aluminium plate, and a heat equation. Chapter 14 serves as a summary of the book and as a forum for the presentation of open problems. The book closes with chapter 15 that contains a list of problems suitable as the classroom exercises. To sum up, this book presents an in-depth study of the reduction methods based on the Author's own research results and the results of many others (let me mention the names of B. C. Moore, B. D. O. Anderson, K. Glover, A. Lindquist, J. C. Willems, P. A. Fuhrmann and D. C. Sorensen), obtained in over the last two decades. The mathematical theory developed in this book culminates with a comparative study showing the applicability of the reduction techniques to systems whose dimension varies from several tens up to more than 20,000. A unique combination of the rigorous theory, the emphasis on efficient computability, and the strong practical relevance earns this treatise a permanent place in the control theory literature.}},

While Gramians and energy functionals of stochastic linear systems show a strong correspondence to the analogous objects for deterministic linear systems, the relation of Gramians and energy functionals for bilinear systems is less obvious. We discuss results from the literature for the latter problem and provide new characterizations of input and output energies of bilinear systems in terms of algebraic Gramians satisfying generalized Lyapunov equations. In any of the considered cases, the definition of algebraic Gramians allows us to compute balancing transformations and implies model reduction methods analogous to balanced truncation for linear deterministic systems. We illustrate the performance of these model reduction methods by showing numerical experiments for different bilinear systems.}},

  abstract  = {{This monograph arises from the dissertation of the author.\par Some results on the existence of solutions to Riccati and Lyapunov equations as well as on convergence to these solutions using a Newton iteration algorithm are obtained.\par An important portion of the work presents the basic ingredients: First the author recalls stabilization ideas in a stochastic context. The Riccati equation which appears in the first chapter is explained next when presenting optimal stabilization and disturbance rejection. Chapter three reviews notions on ordered function spaces. The notion of resolvent positive operators will be of importance. In such an ordered function space and associated cone $C$, a bounded operator $T$ is resolvent positive if $(\alpha\text{Id}-T)^{-1}$ is bounded and leaves $C$ invariant for all $\alpha$ reals greater than an certain $\alpha_0$. It is seen that the Lyapunov operator is resolvent position, and the (mean-square) stability of a linear stochastic system is equivalent to resolvent positivity of an associated Lyapunov-type operator. In the next chapter, Newton's method in an operator theoretic context is recalled, and nonlocal convergence results of Riccati operators using the notions of concavity and resolvent positivity are established. In chapter five, the solution to the Riccati equation with indefinite constraints is obtained via a duality method which allows one to recover the concavity assumption of before.\par There are 221 references, a modest index and a list of notations at the end.\par The contributions of this work, when suitably compressed, would constitute excellent publications. In this book format, the presentation does not permit these contributions to be put in the context of the thousands of published works on the Riccati equation. The context of the author (the reminders) serve the interest of the cause and support the establishment of the specific results.}},

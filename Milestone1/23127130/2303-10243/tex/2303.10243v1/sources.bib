	abstract="This paper considers dynamic coverage control of multiple power-constrained agents subject to 3D rigid body kinematics. The agents are deployed to patrol a domain until the entire space has reached a satisfactory level of coverage. This is achieved through the gathering of information by a forward-facing sensor footprint, modelled as an anisotropic spherical sector. Coverage and collision avoidance guarantees are met by a hybrid controller consisting of four operating modes: local coverage, global coverage, waypoint scan and subdomain transfer. Energy-aware methods are encoded into the global coverage state to shift the bulk of spatial redistribution onto less constrained agents. Additionally, a novel domain partitioning strategy is used that directs individual agents to explore within concentric hemispherical shells around a centralized charging station. This results in flight paths that are guaranteed to terminate at the charging station in the limit that agent batteries expire. The efficacy of this algorithm is presented through experimental trials with three agents in an indoor environment. Simulations are provided for ten agents.",

The manifold is subject to continual impact by intruders which travel at constant velocities along arbitrarily oriented straight-line trajectories. The trajectories of intruders are estimated online with an extended Kalman filter and their predicted impact points contribute normally distributed decay terms to the coverage level. A formal hybrid control strategy is presented that allows for power-constrained 3-D free-flyer agents to persistently monitor the domain, track and intercept intruders, and periodically deploy from and return to a single charging station on the manifold. Guarantees on intruder interception with respect to agent power lifespans are formally proven. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulation."

	abstract = "Underactuated collision-free controllers are proposed in this paper for multiple spacecraft formation reconfiguration in circular orbits with the loss of either the radial or in-track thrust. A nonlinear dynamical model of underactuated formation flying is introduced, which is then linearized about circular orbits for controllability and feasibility analyses on underactuated formation reconfiguration. By using the inherent dynamics coupling of system states, reduced-order sliding mode controllers are then designed for either case to indirectly stabilize the system trajectories to the desired formations. In consideration of the collision-avoidance requirement, the artificial potential function method is then employed to design novel underactuated collision-avoidance maneuvers. Rigorous proof substantiates the capabilities of such maneuvers in preventing collisions even in the absence of radial or in-track thrust. Furthermore, a Lyapunov-based analysis ensures the asymptotic stability of the overall closed-loop system. Numerical simulations are performed in a J2-perturbed environment to verify the validity of the proposed underactuated control schemes for collision-free reconfiguration."

For a massive asteroid, the leader spacecraft flies under the gravity field of the asteroid. For a small asteroid, the asteroid gravity is negligible, and a trajectory planning method is proposed based on elliptic cavity virtual potential field. The self-organizing control strategy for the follower spacecraft is developed based on a mechanism of velocity planning and velocity tracking. The simulation results show that the self-organizing control strategy is valid for both massive asteroid and small asteroid, and the exploration swarm forms a stable configuration."

	abstract = "Traditionally, satellite constellation design has focused on optimizing global, zonal or regional coverage with a minimum number of satellites. In some instances, however, it is desirable to deploy a constellation in stages to gradually expand capacity. This requires launching additional satellites and reconfiguring the existing on-orbit satellites. Also, a constellation might be retasked and reconfigured after it is initially fielded for operational reasons. This paper presents a methodology for optimizing orbital reconfigurations of satellite constellations. The work focuses on technical aspects for transforming an initial constellation A into a new constellation, B, typically with a larger number of satellites. A general framework was developed to study the orbital reconfiguration problem. The framework was applied to low Earth orbit constellations of communication satellites. This paper specifically addresses the problem of determining the optimal assignment for transferring on-orbit satellites in constellation A to constellation B such that the total ΔV for the reconfiguration is minimized. It is shown that the auction algorithm, used for solving general network flow problems, can efficiently and reliably determine the optimum assignment of satellites of A to slots of B. Based on this methodology, reconfiguration maps can be created, which show the energy required for transforming one constellation into another as a function of type (Street-of-Coverage, Walker, Draim), altitude, ground elevation angle and fold of coverage. Suggested extensions of this work include quantification of the tradeoff between reconfiguration time and ΔV, multiple successive reconfigurations, balancing propellant consumption within the constellation during reconfiguration as well as using reconfigurability as an objective during initial constellation design."

Now an effective database of pulsars angle position with high precision has not been developed. The precision of pulsar angle position measurement could be greatly improved by observing a pulsar jointly at the same time with several satellites. While observing the same pulsar the satellites have to set their attitude and orbit coordinately. There should be a constraint of tasks, spatial graphs, agreements and time in the observing process. In paper a plan of observing a pulsar at the same time by several satellites is put forward, a method of multi-satellites coordinated control is presented, and a digital experiment is carried out for simulating the proposed scheme. As results, the plan is feasible, the controller of the satellites orbit position and attitude is stable, the plan and control method is especially suitable for X-ray pulsar interferometry so that the accuracy of pulsar angle position can be improved by observation with multi-satellites formation.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive impact of active debris mitigation campaigns upon the growth of debris populations, but comparatively fewer investigations incorporate specific mission scenarios. Furthermore, while many active mitigation methods have been proposed, certain classes of debris objects are amenable to mitigation campaigns employing chaser spacecraft with existing chemical and low-thrust propulsive technologies. This investigation incorporates an ant colony optimization routing algorithm and multi-agent coordination via auctions into a debris mitigation tour scheme suitable for preliminary mission design and analysis as well as spacecraft flight operations."

	abstract = "Autonomous cluster operation such as cluster reconfiguration is one of the enabling technologies for fractionated spacecraft. By virtue of the multi-agent system theory, this paper presents an organizational architecture for fractionated spacecraft, which not only enables autonomous cluster operations but also facilitates its non-traditional attributes. Within this organizational architecture, a decentralized framework is proposed to solve cluster reconfiguration problems based on primal and dual decomposition, where subgradient methods are adopted to include reconfiguration cases with non-differentiable objectives. Two typical constraints are considered: final configuration constraints representing coupling variables and collision avoidance constraints representing coupling constraints, both of which are non-convex. General schemes are proposed to convexify those constraints via the linearization and convex restriction technology. Then final configuration constraints are tackled by primal decomposition, while collision avoidance constraints by dual decomposition. To the end, multi-level primal and dual decompositions are employed to solve reconfiguration problems with both coupling variables and coupling constraints. For illustration an example of in-plane cluster reconfiguration is solved and compared with the centralized approach the solution is optimal."

	abstract = 	 {Modern nonlinear control theory seeks to endow systems with properties of stability and safety, and have been deployed successfully in multiple domains. Despite this success, model uncertainty remains a significant challenge in synthesizing safe controllers, leading to degradation in the properties provided by the controllers. This paper develops a machine learning framework utilizing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to reduce model uncertainty as it impact the safe behavior of a system. This approach iteratively collects data and updates a controller, ultimately achieving safe behavior. We validate this method in simulation and experimentally on a Segway platform.}

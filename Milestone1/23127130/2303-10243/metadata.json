    "abstract": "This paper presents extensions of control barrier function (CBF) and control Lyapunov function (CLF) theory to systems wherein all actuators cause impulsive changes to the state trajectory, and can only be used again after a minimum dwell time has elapsed. These rules define a hybrid system, wherein the controller must at each control cycle choose whether to remain on the current state flow or to jump to a new trajectory. We first derive a sufficient condition to render a specified set forward invariant using extensions of CBF theory. We then derive related conditions to ensure asymptotic stability in such systems, and apply both conditions online in an optimization-based control law with aperiodic impulses. We simulate both results on a spacecraft docking problem with multiple obstacles.",

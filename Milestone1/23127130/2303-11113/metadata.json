    "abstract": "We generalize the results by Eisenbud and Schreyer about Ulrich bundles over Veronese varieties to Segre-Veronese varieties. We discuss the range where we have natural cohomology and we construct multigraded resolutions and monads for Ulrich bundles of any rank. Moreover we give cohomological characterizations for significant families of bundles.",

    "abstract": "Real-time systems applications usually consist of a set of concurrent activities with timing-related properties. Developing these applications requires programming paradigms that can effectively handle the specification of concurrent activities and timing constraints, as well as controlling their execution on a particular platform. The prevailing trend for high-performance, and the use of fine-grained parallel execution makes this an even more challenging task.\n  This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art and challenges for the development of real-time parallel applications, focusing on two current research directions, one from the high-performance arena (based on OpenMP) and another from the real-time and critical systems domain (based on Ada). The paper provides a review of the supported features of each one of the approaches, identifying the still open issues and the current research directions.",

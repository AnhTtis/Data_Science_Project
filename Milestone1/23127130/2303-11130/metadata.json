    "abstract": "Purpose: Lung disease assessment in precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) is essential for appropriate patient management. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning model for lung texture classification in CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA), and evaluate its correlation with clinical assessment methods.\n  Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study with external validation, 122 patients with pre-capillary PH were used to train (n=83), validate (n=17) and test (n=10 internal test, n=12 external test) a patch based DenseNet-121 classification model. \"Normal\", \"Ground glass\", \"Ground glass with reticulation\", \"Honeycombing\", and \"Emphysema\" were classified as per the Fleishner Society glossary of terms. Ground truth classes were segmented by two radiologists with patches extracted from the labelled regions. Proportion of lung volume for each texture was calculated by classifying patches throughout the entire lung volume to generate a coarse texture classification mapping throughout the lung parenchyma. AI output was assessed against diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and specialist radiologist reported disease severity.\n  Results: Micro-average AUCs for the validation, internal test, and external test were 0.92, 0.95, and 0.94, respectively. The model had consistent performance across parenchymal textures, demonstrated strong correlation with diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), and showed good correspondence with disease severity reported by specialist radiologists.\n  Conclusion: The classification model demonstrates excellent performance on external validation. The clinical utility of its output has been demonstrated. This objective, repeatable measure of disease severity can aid in patient management in adjunct to radiological reporting.",

    "abstract": "Planar functions, introduced by Dembowski and Ostrom, have attracted much attention in the last decade. As shown in this paper, we present a new class of planar functions of the form $\\operatorname{Tr}(ax^{q+1})+\\ell(x^2)$ on an extension of the finite field $\\mathbb F_{q^n}/\\mathbb F_q$. Specifically, we investigate those functions on $\\mathbb F_{q^2}/\\mathbb F_q$ and construct several typical kinds of planar functions. We also completely characterize them on $\\mathbb F_{q^3}/\\mathbb F_q$. When the degree of extension is higher, it will be proved that such planar functions do not exist given certain conditions.",

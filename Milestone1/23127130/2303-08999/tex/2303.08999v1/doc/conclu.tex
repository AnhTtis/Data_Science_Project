\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclu}

In this paper, a high-performance accelerator is proposed for the super-resolution model LAPAR. %, which is evaluated on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. 
% To deal with the challenge of the computation and communication bottlenecks resulting from dictionary learning operations, 
We introduce a lightweight compression method to learn representative dictionaries of the dictionary learning algorithm. 
A novel acceleration engine is designed to get the best efficiency and utilization of hardware resources. 
The evaluation results have shown our system outperforms the state-of-the-art tool TensorRT, 
and PyTorch on edge embedded GPU NVIDIA Jetson NX and 2080 Ti significantly, without quality degradation.

% The last few years have witnessed impressive progress of super-resolution (SR) image and video processing, with the help of deep learning methods. 
% However, compared with traditional detection or classification task, it is very difficult to achieve real-time SR processing on edge devices, 
% due to SR data frames with extremely large sizes and the huge amounts of computations resulting from the special dictionary learning operators. 
% In this paper, to tackle the challenges, we propose to implement a high-performance accelerator for SR processing on edge GPU. 
% Dictionary learning operation that is typically used in SR processing is analyzed in detail, 
% and an optimized computing engine is invented to accelerate it. 
% % To overcome the resulting communication and computation bottlenecks, in particular, 
% % optimized memory reorganization and computation rescheduling strategies are proposed. 
% Besides, task reorganization and system-level parallelism are maximized aggressively to accelerate the computations on the large SR data frames. 
% Efficient memory and communication patterns are designed to reduce the cache miss. 
% % With our optimizations, the crucial issues, \textit{i.e.}, large communication latency and computation blocking are solved efficiently.
% LAPAR SR model is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX with our proposed optimizations.
% Compared with the state-of-the-art commercial tool TensorRT 7.1, our accelerator achieves much lower latency, with higher resource utilization. 


Recent years have witnessed impressive progress in super-resolution (SR) processing. 
However, its real-time inference requirement sets a challenge not only for the model design but also for the on-chip implementation. 
In this paper, we implement a full-stack SR acceleration framework on embedded GPU devices. 
The special dictionary learning algorithm used in SR models was analyzed in detail and accelerated via a novel dictionary selective strategy. 
Besides, the hardware programming architecture together with the model structure is analyzed to guide the optimal design of computation kernels to minimize the inference latency under the resource constraints. 
% composed of both model compression and hardware implementation. 
% Within the work, the special dictionary learning algorithm used in SR models was analyzed in detail and an optimized computing engine is invented to accelerate it.
% Besides, some techniques including structured network pruning, system-level parallelism, and optimal design searching constrained by GPU architectures are proposed to erase the communication and computation bottlenecks. 
With these novel techniques, the communication and computation bottlenecks in the deep dictionary learning-based SR models are tackled perfectly. 
The experiments on the edge embedded NVIDIA NX and 2080Ti show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art NVIDIA TensorRT significantly, and can achieve real-time performance. 
% We deploy the LAPAR-SR model on NVIDIA GPU and the performance outperforms the state-of-art tool NVIDIA TensorRT significantly.

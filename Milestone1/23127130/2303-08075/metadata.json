    "abstract": "Entanglement is considered a fundamental ingredient for quantum technologies and condensed matter systems are among the good candidates for quantum devices. For bipartite pure states the von Neumann entropy is a proper measure of entanglement, while the linear entropy, associated to the mixedness of the reduced density matrices, is a simpler quantity to be obtained and is considered to be qualitatively equivalent to the von Neumann. Here we investigate both linear and von Neumann entropies for quantifying entanglement in homogeneous, superlattice and disordered Hubbard chains. We find regimes of parameters for which the linear entropy fails in reproducing the qualitative behavior of the von Neumann entropy. This then may lead to incorrect predictions i) of maximum and minimum entanglement states and ii) of quantum phase transitions.",

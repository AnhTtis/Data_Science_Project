    "abstract": "Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) shine at multi-wavelengths and are expected to constitute the largest class of gamma-ray sources in our Galaxy. They are known to be very efficient particle accelerators: the Crab nebula, the PWNe class prototype, is the unique firmly identified leptonic PeVatron of the Galaxy to date, and most of the PeVatrons recently detected by LHAASO appear to be compatible with a pulsar origin. PWNe have been proved to be associated with the formation of misaligned X-ray tails and TeV halos, as sign of an efficient escape of energetic particles from the PWN into the surrounding medium. With the advent of the Cherenkov Telescope Array we expect that ~200 new PWNe will be detected. Being able to correctly model their multi-wavelength spectral properties, spatial and spectral morphology at gamma-rays is then topical today. This in particular means we should be able to account for their different evolutionary phases, and to correctly determine the influence they have on the spectral properties of the source. This indeed reflects directly on the expectation of how many PWNe will be detected at gamma-rays. Finally, the identification of PWNe in future gamma-ray data, not only is relevant for their scientific importance, but also to allow for the identification of less prominent sources that might be hidden by the background of non-identified PWNe.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the definition of $\\bf{t}$-spread monomial ideals, in this paper, we introduce $\\bf{t}$-spread $d$-partite hypergraph $K^{\\bf t}_V$ and study its edge ideal $I(K^{\\bf t}_V)$. We prove that $I(K^{\\bf t}_V)$ has linear quotients, all powers of $I(K^{\\bf t}_V)$ have linear resolution and the Rees algebra of $I(K^{\\bf t}_V)$ is a normal Cohen-Macaulay domain. It is also shown that $I(K^{\\bf t}_V)$ is normally torsion-free and a complete characterization of Cohen-Macaulay $S/I(K^{\\bf t}_V)$ is given.",

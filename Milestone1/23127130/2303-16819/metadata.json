    "abstract": "We show that the sequence $(αn)_{n\\in \\mathcal{B}}$ is uniformly distributed modulo 1, for every irrational $α$, provided $\\mathcal{B}$ belongs to a certain family of integer sequences, which includes the prime, almost prime, squarefree, practical, densely divisible and lexicographical numbers. We also give an estimate for the discrepancy if $α$ has finite irrationality measure.",

    "abstract": "Having common reference frames, i.e. aligned coordinate systems, is one of the presumptions in witnessing entanglement in a two-party state possessed by two remote parties. This assumption may fail for many reasons. In this article, we propose a method for witnessing entanglement in the absence of any common coordinate systems. We show that with shared singlet states, no matter what kind of witness the two parties have in mind and no matter what the dimension of the state is, the two remote parties can still witness entanglement with the same efficiency as the original witness. Beyond the context of Entanglement Witnesses, our method works also for remote measurements of observables of particles (entangled or not) in laboratories which may have deficiency in their resources",

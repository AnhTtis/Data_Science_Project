\section{Contribution}

In this research, our goal is to explore the effectiveness of the explicit embedding vector approach and compare it with the more established implicit sentiment solution. The main contributions achieved during the study of this topic are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Demonstrated the statistical dependence between stock price volatility and Twitter post sentiments.
    \item Proved intrinsic linkage between two kinds of representations 
    by showing that embeddings hold information on sentiments.
    \item Discovered the superiority of the sentiment extraction approach over the usage of embedding vectors in the prevailing number of cases. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{abstract}
% The study of the stock market using machine learning techniques is an important task that can reveal patterns and dynamics that are difficult to detect using traditional methods. This knowledge can help researchers better understand the behavior of financial markets and develop new models to explain their movements. Despite its significance, most research in stock movement prediction relies on extracting sentiment from the text and using it as the primary feature for prediction, leaving little exploration of the potential of semantic features and context in financial market trends. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap in research by testing the hypothesis that semantic features and context are important for stock price prediction. Our approach uses sentence embeddings extracted from Twitter data to capture semantic information and contextual relationships with financial market trends. We compare our approach to traditional sentiment-based solutions to evaluate its performance and potential impact on the field of stock price prediction.
% To achieve this, we train multiple models with a custom loss function on a dataset consisting of Twitter data and stock prices. Our results show that the use of sentence embeddings in our experiment lead us to a discovery that eliminates the need to solve the problem of sentiment extraction without a significant loss in quality for final predictions. Our findings contribute to the field of stock price prediction by highlighting the advantages and limitations of the use of sentence embeddings in this task. They provide a valuable insight into the cases where it delivers better results in comparison with baseline sentiment approach. In multiple experiments both sentiment and semantic approaches demonstrated similar performance proving the initial hypothesis of the semantic features importance in predicting financial market trends. In the future works section, we suggest possible continuations for further research to explore alternative methods for incorporating semantic and contextual information into stock price prediction models.

The study of the stock market with the attraction of machine learning approaches is a major direction for revealing hidden market regularities. This knowledge contributes to a profound understanding of financial market dynamics and getting behavioural insights, which could hardly be discovered with traditional analytical methods. Stock prices are inherently interrelated with world events and social perception. Thus, in constructing the model for stock price prediction, the critical stage is to incorporate such information on the outside world, reflected through news and social media posts. To accommodate this, researchers leverage the implicit or explicit knowledge representations: (1) sentiments extracted from the texts or (2) raw text embeddings. However, there is too little research attention to the direct comparison of these approaches in terms of the influence on the predictive power of financial models. In this paper, we aim to close this gap and figure out whether the semantic features in the form of contextual embeddings are more valuable than sentiment attributes for forecasting market trends. We consider the corpus of Twitter posts related to the largest companies by capitalization from NASDAQ and their close prices. To start, we demonstrate the connection of tweet sentiments with the volatility of companies' stock prices. Convinced of the existing relationship, we train Temporal Fusion Transformer models for price prediction supplemented with either tweet sentiments or tweet embeddings. Our results show that in the substantially prevailing number of cases, the use of sentiment features leads to higher metrics. Noteworthy, the conclusions are justifiable within the considered scenario involving Twitter posts and stocks of the biggest tech companies. 

% However, for the most part, two approaches demonstrate similar performance, leaving us with the option to omit an additional model for sentiment extraction and use text embeddings. 
% We provide the characteristics of the conditions under which the particular information representation might be more beneficial. 

% For one who faces choice between two information representations, we provide the description of the situations when one form might be more beneficial than another. 

% It is important the limitation of conducted research is that we make a comparison only within restricted use case - Twitter posts and stocks of companies from NASDAQ index.

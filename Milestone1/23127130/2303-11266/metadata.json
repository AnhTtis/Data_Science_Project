    "abstract": "The recently developed Projective Quantum Eigensolver (PQE) has been demonstrated as an elegant methodology to compute the ground state energy of molecular systems in Noisy Intermdiate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The iterative optimization of the ansatz parameters involves repeated construction of residues on a quantum device. The quintessential pattern of the iteration dynamics, when projected as a time discrete map, suggests a hierarchical structure in the timescale of convergence, effectively partitioning the parameters into two distinct classes. In this work, we have exploited the collective interplay of these two sets of parameters via machine learning techniques to bring out the synergistic inter-relationship among them that triggers a drastic reduction in the number of quantum measurements necessary for the parameter updates while maintaining the characteristic accuracy of PQE. Furthermore the machine learning model may be tuned to capture the noisy data of NISQ devices and thus the predicted energy is shown to be resilient under a given noise model.",

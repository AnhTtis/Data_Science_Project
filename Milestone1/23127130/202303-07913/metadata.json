    "abstract": "Reactions with enzymes are critical in biochemistry, where the enzymes act as\ncatalysis in the process. One of the most used mechanisms for modeling\nenzyme-catalyzed reactions is the Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetic. In the ODE\nlevel, i.e. concentrations are only on time-dependent, this kinetic can be\nrigorously derived from mass action law using quasi-steady-state approximation.\nThis issue in the PDE setting, for instance when molecular diffusion is taken\ninto account, is considerably more challenging and only formal derivations have\nbeen established. In this paper, we prove this derivation rigorously and obtain\nMM kinetic in the presence of spatial diffusion. In particular, we show that,\nin general, the reduced problem is a cross-diffusion-reaction system. Our proof\nis based on improved duality method, heat regularisation and a suitable\nmodified energy function. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the\nfirst rigorous derivation of MM kinetic from mass action kinetic in the PDE\nsetting.",

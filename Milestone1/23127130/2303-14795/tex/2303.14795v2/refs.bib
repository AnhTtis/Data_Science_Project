abstract = {Purpose We introduce a framework that enables efficient sampling from learned probability distributions for MRI reconstruction. Method Samples are drawn from the posterior distribution given the measured k-space using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, different from conventional deep learning-based MRI reconstruction techniques. In addition to the maximum a posteriori estimate for the image, which can be obtained by maximizing the log-likelihood indirectly or directly, the minimum mean square error estimate and uncertainty maps can also be computed from those drawn samples. The data-driven Markov chains are constructed with the score-based generative model learned from a given image database and are independent of the forward operator that is used to model the k-space measurement. Results We numerically investigate the framework from these perspectives: (1) the interpretation of the uncertainty of the image reconstructed from undersampled k-space; (2) the effect of the number of noise scales used to train the generative models; (3) using a burn-in phase in MCMC sampling to reduce computation; (4) the comparison to conventional ℓ1\$\$ {\ell}\_1 \$\$-wavelet regularized reconstruction; (5) the transferability of learned information; and (6) the comparison to fastMRI challenge. Conclusion A framework is described that connects the diffusion process and advanced generative models with Markov chains. We demonstrate its flexibility in terms of contrasts and sampling patterns using advanced generative priors and the benefits of also quantifying the uncertainty for every pixel.}

abstract = {Score-based diffusion models provide a powerful way to model images using the gradient of the data distribution. Leveraging the learned score function as a prior, here we introduce a way to sample data from a conditional distribution given the measurements, such that the model can be readily used for solving inverse problems in imaging, especially for accelerated MRI. In short, we train a continuous time-dependent score function with denoising score matching. Then, at the inference stage, we iterate between the numerical SDE solver and data consistency step to achieve reconstruction. Our model requires magnitude images only for training, and yet is able to reconstruct complex-valued data, and even extends to parallel imaging. The proposed method is agnostic to sub-sampling patterns and has excellent generalization capability so that it can be used with any sampling schemes for any body parts that are not used for training data. Also, due to its generative nature, our approach can quantify uncertainty, which is not possible with standard regression settings. On top of all the advantages, our method also has very strong performance, even beating the models trained with full supervision. With extensive experiments, we verify the superiority of our method in terms of quality and practicality.}

abstract = {Abstract Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful technique to aid clinical diagnosis. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to jointly reconstruct multiple T1/T2-weighted images of the same anatomical cross section from partially sampled k -space data. The joint reconstruction problem is formulated as minimizing a linear combination of three terms, corresponding to a least squares data fitting, joint total variation (TV) and group wavelet-sparsity regularization. It is rooted in two observations: 1) the variance of image gradients should be similar for the same spatial position across multiple contrasts; 2) the wavelet coefficients of all images from the same anatomical cross section should have similar sparse modes. To efficiently solve this problem, we decompose it into joint TV regularization and group sparsity subproblems, respectively. Finally, the reconstructed image is obtained from the weighted average of solutions from the two subproblems, in an iterative framework. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing multi-contrast MRI methods.},

For almost all results in this literature, the structure is represented by sparsity in a well-chosen basis. We show how to achieve guarantees similar to standard compressed sensing but without employing sparsity at all. Instead, we suppose that vectors lie near the range of a generative model $G: \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^n$. Our main theorem is that, if $G$ is $L$-Lipschitz, then roughly $\mathcal{O}(k \log L)$ random Gaussian measurements suffice for an $\ell_2/\ell_2$ recovery guarantee. We demonstrate our results using generative models from published variational autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. Our method can use $5$-$10$x fewer measurements than Lasso for the same accuracy.}

abstract = {Purpose A new acquisition and reconstruction method called T2 Shuffling is presented for volumetric fast spin-echo (three-dimensional [3D] FSE) imaging. T2 Shuffling reduces blurring and recovers many images at multiple T2 contrasts from a single acquisition at clinically feasible scan times (6–7 min). Theory and Methods The parallel imaging forward model is modified to account for temporal signal relaxation during the echo train. Scan efficiency is improved by acquiring data during the transient signal decay and by increasing echo train lengths without loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By (1) randomly shuffling the phase encode view ordering, (2) constraining the temporal signal evolution to a low-dimensional subspace, and (3) promoting spatio-temporal correlations through locally low rank regularization, a time series of virtual echo time images is recovered from a single scan. A convex formulation is presented that is robust to partial voluming and radiofrequency field inhomogeneity. Results Retrospective undersampling and in vivo scans confirm the increase in sharpness afforded by T2 Shuffling. Multiple image contrasts are recovered and used to highlight pathology in pediatric patients. A proof-of-principle method is integrated into a clinical musculoskeletal imaging workflow. Conclusion The proposed T2 Shuffling method improves the diagnostic utility of 3D FSE by reducing blurring and producing multiple image contrasts from a single scan.

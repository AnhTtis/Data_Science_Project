    "abstract": "In this work, we develop an approach mentioned by da Veiga and Gamboa in 2013. It consists in extending the very interestingpoint of view introduced in \\cite{gine2008simple} to estimate general nonlinear integral functionals of a density on the real line, by using empirically a kernel estimator erasing the diagonal terms.  Relaxing the  positiveness assumption on the kernel and choosing a kernel of order large enough, we are able to prove a central limit theorem for estimating Sobol' indices of any order (the bias is killed thanks to this signed kernel).",

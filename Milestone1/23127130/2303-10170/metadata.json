    "abstract": "Using the path integral approach, we derive the low energy interactions between axions and electromagnetic field that arise in models with heavy dyons charged under a spontaneously broken global axial $U(1)$ symmetry. Hence, we obtain generic axion-Maxwell equations relevant for experimental searches. We find that the structure of the axion Maxwell equations could be significantly different compared to what is normally assumed in the literature, as the derived equations feature new axion-dependent terms including CP-violating ones. The new terms can reconcile the Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong CP problem with astrophysical axion hints, as well as give unique signatures in light-shining-through-wall and haloscope experiments. Moreover, via the latter signatures, these experiments can indirectly probe the existence of heavy dyons.",

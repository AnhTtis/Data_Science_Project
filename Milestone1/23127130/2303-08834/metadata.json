    "abstract": "We study short operators in planar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM at strong coupling, for general spin and $SO(6)$ symmetric traceless representations. At strong coupling their dimension grows like $Δ\\sim 2\\sqrtδ λ^{1/4}$ and their spectrum of degeneracies can be analysed by considering the massive spectrum of type II strings in flat space-time. We furthermore compute their structure constants with two arbitrary chiral primary operators. This is done by considering the four-point correlator of arbitrary chiral primary operators at strong coupling in planar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, including the supergravity approximation plus the infinite tower of stringy corrections that contributes in the flat space limit. Our results are valid for generic rank $n$ symmetric traceless representations of $SO(6)$ and in particular for $n \\gg 1$, as long as $n \\ll λ^{1/4}$.",

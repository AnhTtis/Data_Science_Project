\section{Experimental details}



\subsection{Implementation of reproduction}

\noindent
\textbf{NBA dataset. }
We reproduce GAR~\cite{wu2019learning, gavrilyuk2020actor, pramono2020empowering, yuan2021spatio} and WSGAR~\cite{yan2020social,kim2022detector} methods following the official code of DIN\footnote{\label{note1}Original DIN codes are available at \url{https://github.com/JacobYuan7/DIN_GAR}.}~\cite{yuan2021spatio}, DFWSGAR\footnote{\label{note2}Original DFWSGAR codes are available at \url{https://github.com/dk-kim/DFWSGAR}.}~\cite{kim2022detector} and the implementation description illustrated in its original paper, repectively. 
For a fair comparison, segment-based sampling~\cite{wang2016temporal}, batch size of 4, the number of bounding boxes $N=12$, and the number of frames $T=18$ are applied for all methods.
The only difference from the implementation of DIN is that all methods are trained in an end-to-end manner. 
Unless specified, all other hyperparameters are identical to those of the code from DIN.
We provide more implementation details of each model below. 

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep=-0.5mm
    \item \textbf{ARG}~\cite{wu2019learning}
    ResNet-18 backbone replaces the original backbone of Inception-v3. 
    \item \textbf{AT}~\cite{gavrilyuk2020actor}
    A single RGB branch is utilized and ResNet-18 backbone replaces the backbone of I3D and HRNet. 
    \item \textbf{SACRF}~\cite{pramono2020empowering}
    The backbone is replaced to ResNet-18, and its multiple modalities are substituted to single RGB input. 
    Since NBA dataset does not have individual action labels, we remove the unary energy term. 
    \item \textbf{DIN}~\cite{yuan2021spatio}
    The experiment is conducted following its official implementation. 
    \item \textbf{SAM}~\cite{yan2020social}
    The number of proposals ($N^p$) and the number of selected proposals ($K^p$) are set to 14 and 8, respectively.
    \item \textbf{DFWSGAR}~\cite{kim2022detector} is conducted following its official implementation.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Volleyball dataset. }
Reproduction of the following models is also based on the code of DIN\textsuperscript{\ref{note1}}~\cite{yuan2021spatio}.
Each reproduction first goes through backbone training process regarding the number of categories, then proceeds to train each inference module afterward.
Note that MCA values of the following models under fully supervised setting are brought from DIN~\cite{yuan2021spatio}, hence we provide implementation detail of experiments under \textbf{A)} fully supervised setting with the aim of classifying actions into 6 (merged) labels, \textbf{B)} weakly supervised setting/8 labels, and \textbf{C)} weakly supervised setting/6 labels.
In weakly supervised setting, actor bounding boxes are replaced to proposal boxes generated by Faster R-CNN~\cite{girshick2015fast} pretrained on COCO dataset~\cite{lin2014microsoft} and individual action annotations are eliminated.
In general, we use a batch size of 2 and the number of frames $T = 10$ for the following work.
Unless mentioned, other hyperparameters are set based on the code provided by DIN.
Followings are further implementation details of each model.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep=-0.5mm
\item \textbf{PCTDM}~\cite{yan2018participation}
ResNet-18 is applied instead of AlexNet, and RoIAlign features replace cropped/resized individual images of the original paper. 
Furthermore, weight decay rate of $1 \times 10^{-4}$ is applied to \textbf{C)}.
\item \textbf{ARG}~\cite{wu2019learning} 
Likewise, its backbone is changed to ResNet-18. Unlike its original setting, the backbone training is allowed in the model training process for a fair comparison with other models.

\item \textbf{AT}~\cite{gavrilyuk2020actor}
A single RGB branch is utilized and ResNet-18 backbone replaces the backbone of I3D and HRNet.

\item \textbf{SACRF}~\cite{pramono2020empowering}
The backbone is replaced to ResNet-18, and its multiple modalities are substituted to single RGB input.
Due to the removal of individual action labels, the unary energy term is removed.

\item \textbf{DIN}~\cite{yuan2021spatio}
The experiment is conducted following its official implementation.





\end{itemize}






SAM~\cite{yan2020social} is reproduced following the method described in the original paper.
The major difference with DIN-based reproductions is that it occupies a batch size of 8, a dropout rate of 0.1, and $T=3$ frames. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{SAM}~\cite{yan2020social}
Note that SAM itself is a WSGAR work, so \textbf{A)} is disregarded. Since \textbf{C)} is already conducted in the original paper, we only reproduce \textbf{B)}. The number of proposals ($N^p$) and the number of selected proposals ($K^p$) are set to 16 and 12, respectively. 
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Implementation of video backbones}
We reproduce recent video backbones, ResNet-18 TSM~\cite{lin2019tsm} and VideoSwin-T~\cite{liu2021video} following the official codes. 
For a fair comparison, sampling strategy and training details are the same as ours.

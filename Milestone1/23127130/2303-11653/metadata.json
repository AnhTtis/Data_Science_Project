    "abstract": "The main focus of this work is the study of several cones relating the eigenvalues or singular values of a matrix to those of its off-diagonal blocks. Some of these cones were studied by Fomin-Fulton-Li-Poon twenty years ago, but we will explain why their description is incomplete and how we can remedy it using the O'Shea-Sjamaar theorem.",

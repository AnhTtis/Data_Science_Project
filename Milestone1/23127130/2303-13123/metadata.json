    "abstract": "Out of distribution (OOD) medical images are frequently encountered, e.g. because of site- or scanner differences, or image corruption. OOD images come with a risk of incorrect image segmentation, potentially negatively affecting downstream diagnoses or treatment. To ensure robustness to such incorrect segmentations, we propose Laplacian Segmentation Networks (LSN) that jointly model epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty in image segmentation. We capture data uncertainty with a spatially correlated logit distribution. For model uncertainty, we propose the first Laplace approximation of the weight posterior that scales to large neural networks with skip connections that have high-dimensional outputs. Empirically, we demonstrate that modelling spatial pixel correlation allows the Laplacian Segmentation Network to successfully assign high epistemic uncertainty to out-of-distribution objects appearing within images.",

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Memory subsystem bottlenecks are one of the primary reasons for stagnating IPC on cloud workloads. Datacenters comprise a significant part of the server processor market, but benchmarks used for CPU designs often do not represent their characteristics. In this work, we present a detailed characterization of \chtxt{\company's} cloud workloads using \memprof and use the findings that cores share code cachelines to propose shared L2 cache and shared L2 I-TLB caches. Next, we look into the memory bandwidth behavior of cloud workloads and evaluate memory bandwidth tiering to achieve throughput and TCO improvements. Finally, we look into ways to improve memory latency. We collect production memory traces and verify their accuracy for future memory prefetcher research. %

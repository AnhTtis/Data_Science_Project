This “Fermi-arc metal” exhibits the chiral anomaly of the parental Weyl semimetal. However, unlike in the parental Weyl semimetal, in the Fermi-arc metal the “ultraquantum state,” in which the anomalous chiral Landau level is the only state at the Fermi energy, is already reached for a finite energy window at zero magnetic field. The dominance of the ultraquantum state implies a universal low-field ballistic magnetoconductance and the absence of quantum oscillations, making the Fermi surface “invisible” to de Haas–van Alphen and Shubnikov–de Haas effects, although it signifies its presence in other response properties.},

We review the different physical means of generating pseudo-fields, the observable consequences of pseudo-fields and their similarities to and differences from electromagnetic fields. Among these differences is their effect on quantum anomalies — absences of classical symmetries in the quantum theory — which we revisit from a quantum field theory and a semi-classical viewpoint.

	abstract = {Implementations of artificial neural networks that borrow analogue techniques could potentially offer low-power alternatives to fully digital approaches1–3. One notable example is in-memory computing based on crossbar arrays of non-volatile memories4–7 that execute, in an analogue manner, multiply–accumulate operations prevalent in artificial neural networks. Various non-volatile memories—including resistive memory8–13, phase-change memory14,15 and flash memory16–19—have been used for such approaches. However, it remains challenging to develop a crossbar array of spin-transfer-torque magnetoresistive random-access memory ({MRAM})20–22,  despite the technology’s practical advantages such as endurance and large-scale commercialization5. The difficulty stems from the low resistance of {MRAM}, which would result in large power consumption in a conventional crossbar array that uses current summation for analogue multiply–accumulate operations. Here we report a 64 × 64 crossbar array based on {MRAM} cells that overcomes the low-resistance issue with an architecture that uses resistance summation for analogue multiply–accumulate operations. The array is integrated with readout electronics in 28-nanometre complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology. Using this array, a two-layer perceptron is implemented to classify 10,000 Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology digits with an accuracy of 93.23 per cent (software baseline: 95.24 per cent). In an emulation of a deeper, eight-layer Visual Geometry Group-8 neural network with measured errors, the classification accuracy improves to 98.86 per cent (software baseline: 99.28 per cent). We also use the array to implement a single layer in a ten-layer neural network to realize face detection with an accuracy of 93.4 per cent.},

	abstract = {Exponential growth in data generation and large-scale data science has created an unprecedented need for inexpensive, low-power, low-latency, high-density information storage. This need has motivated significant research into multi-level memory devices that are capable of storing multiple bits of information per device. The memory state of these devices is intrinsically analog. Furthermore, much of the data they will store, along with the subsequent operations on the majority of this data, are all intrinsically analog-valued. Ironically though, in the current storage paradigm, both the devices and data are quantized for use with digital systems and digital error-correcting codes. Here, we recast the storage problem as a communication problem. This then allows us to use ideas from analog coding and show, using phase change memory as a prototypical multi-level storage technology, that analog-valued emerging memory devices can achieve higher capacities when paired with analog codes. Further, we show that storing analog signals directly through joint coding can achieve low distortion with reduced coding complexity. Specifically, by jointly optimizing for signal statistics, device statistics, and a distortion metric, we demonstrate that single-symbol analog codings can perform comparably to digital codings with asymptotically large code lengths. These results show that end-to-end analog memory systems have the potential to not only reach higher storage capacities than discrete systems but also to significantly lower coding complexity, leading to faster and more energy efficient data storage.},

A crucial characteristic of the memristor is multi-state (also often referred as multibit, and multi-level) switching. Memristors are capable of representing information in an ultra-compact fashion, by storing multiple bits per device. However, certain challenges remain in multi-state memristive circuits and systems design such as device stability and peripheral circuit complexity. In this paper, we review the state of the art of multi-state memristor technologies and their associated {CMOS}/Memristor circuit design, and discuss the challenges regarding device imperfection factors, modelling, peripheral circuit design and layout. We present measurement results of our in-house fabricated multi-state memristor as an example to further illustrate the feasibility of applying multi-state memristors in {CMOS} design, and demonstrate their related future applications such as multi-state memristive memories in machine learning, memristive neuromorphic applications, trimming and tuning circuits, etc. In the end, we summarize past and present efforts done in this field and envisage the direction of multi-state memristor related research.},

Compute-in-memory ({CIM}) based on resistive random-access memory ({RRAM})1 promises to meet such demand by storing {AI} model weights in dense, analogue and non-volatile {RRAM} devices, and by performing {AI} computation directly within {RRAM}, thus eliminating power-hungry data movement between separate compute and memory2–5. Although recent studies have demonstrated in-memory matrix-vector multiplication on fully integrated {RRAM}-{CIM} hardware6–17, it remains a goal for a {RRAM}-{CIM} chip to simultaneously deliver high energy efficiency, versatility to support diverse models and software-comparable accuracy. Although efficiency, versatility and accuracy are all indispensable for broad adoption of the technology, the inter-related trade-offs among them cannot be addressed by isolated improvements on any single abstraction level of the design. Here, by co-optimizing across all hierarchies of the design from algorithms and architecture to circuits and devices, we present {NeuRRAM}—a {RRAM}-based {CIM} chip that simultaneously delivers versatility in reconfiguring {CIM} cores for diverse model architectures, energy efficiency that is two-times better than previous state-of-the-art {RRAM}-{CIM} chips across various computational bit-precisions, and inference accuracy comparable to software models quantized to four-bit weights across various {AI} tasks, including accuracy of 99.0 percent on {MNIST}18 and 85.7 percent on {CIFAR}-1019 image classification, 84.7-percent accuracy on Google speech command recognition20, and a 70-percent reduction in image-reconstruction error on a Bayesian image-recovery task.},

In this brief review, we present the recent progress in two niche applications: neural network accelerators and numerical computing units, mainly focusing on the advances in hardware demonstrations. The former one is regarded as soft computing since it can tolerant some degree of the device and array imperfections. The acceleration of multiple layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and long short-term memory neural networks are described. The latter one is hard computing because the solving of numerical problems requires high-precision devices. Several breakthroughs in memristive equation solvers with improved computation accuracies are highlighted. Besides, other nonvolatile devices with the capability of analog computing are also briefly introduced. Finally, we conclude the review with discussions on the challenges and opportunities for future research toward realizing memristive analog computing machines.},

We compute the diagonal and Hall conductivities in the presence of a {DW}, using both Kubo and Landauer formalisms, and we uncover the effect of {DW} scattering. When the Fermi level lies near Weyl points, we find a strong skew scattering at the {DW} that leads to a significant additional Hall effect. We estimate the average Hall resistivity for multidomain configurations, and we identify the limit where the {DW} scattering contribution becomes significant. We show that a continuum model obtained by linearizing the lattice dispersion around the Weyl points does not correctly capture this {DW} physics. Going beyond the linearized theory, and incorporating leading curvature terms, leads to a semiquantitative agreement with our lattice model results. Our results are potentially relevant for the Hall resistivity of spin-orbit coupled ferromagnetic metals, such as Co3Sn2S2, Co2MnGa, and {SrRuO}3, which can have Weyl points near the Fermi energy.},

These flat bands are nearly degenerate in valley only and are effectively described by a triangular superlattice model. At half filling, we find that interactions induce spontaneous valley correlations that favor spiral order and derive a low-energy valley-Heisenberg model with symmetric and antisymmetric exchange couplings.

	abstract = {The motion of an electron and its spin are generally not coupled. However in a one-dimensional material with strong spin-orbit interaction ({SOI}) a helical state may emerge at finite magnetic fields, where electrons of opposite spin will have opposite momentum. The existence of this helical state has applications for spin filtering and cooper pair splitter devices and is an essential ingredient for realizing topologically protected quantum computing using Majorana zero modes. Here, we report measurements of a quantum point contact in an indium antimonide nanowire. At magnetic fields exceeding 3 T, the 2 e2/h conductance plateau shows a re-entrant feature toward 1 e2/h which increases linearly in width with magnetic field. Rotating the magnetic field clearly attributes this experimental signature to {SOI} and by comparing our observations with a numerical model we extract a spin-orbit energy of approximately 6.5 {meV}, which is stronger than the spin-orbit energy obtained by other methods.},

Herein, artificial synapses based on magnetic materials that use a magnetic tunnel junction ({MTJ}) and a magnetic domain wall ({DW}) are explored. By fabricating lithographic notches in a {DW} track underneath a single {MTJ}, 3–5 stable resistance states that can be repeatably controlled electrically using spin-orbit torque are achieved. The effect of geometry on the synapse behavior is explored, showing that a trapezoidal device has asymmetric weight updates with high controllability, while a rectangular device has higher stochasticity, but with stable resistance levels. The device data is input into neuromorphic computing simulators to show the usefulness of application-specific synaptic functions. Implementing an artificial neural network ({NN}) applied to streamed Fashion-{MNIST} data, the trapezoidal magnetic synapse can be used as a metaplastic function for efficient online learning. Implementing a convolutional {NN} for {CIFAR}-100 image recognition, the rectangular magnetic synapse achieves near-ideal inference accuracy, due to the stability of its resistance levels. This work shows {MW} magnetic synapses are a feasible technology for neuromorphic computing and provides design guidelines for emerging artificial synapse technologies.},

Spin-transfer torques can drive magnetic domain wall motion in a device composed of a single material, but a high threshold current density is typically required to move the domain wall and improving the effective magnetic field in common itinerant ferromagnets is difficult. Here we report magnetism modulation in Co3Sn2S2â€”a magnetic Weyl semimetalâ€”via spin-transfer-torque-driven domain wall motion. We examine the effect of d.c. current on magnetic reversal using anomalous Hall resistance measurements and domain wall motion using time-of-flight measurements. At 160â€‰K, the threshold current density for driving domain wall motion is less than 5.1â€‰Ã—â€‰105â€‰Aâ€‰cmâˆ’2 at zero external field and less than 1.5â€‰Ã—â€‰105â€‰Aâ€‰cmâˆ’2 at a moderate external field (0.2â€‰kOe).

This enhancement is described well by topological Hall torque (THT), which is exerted on a DW by Weyl electrons emerging around Weyl points when an electric field is applied across the DW. The ratio of the Heff arising from the THT to current density is over one order of magnitude higher than that originating from spin-transfer torques and spin-orbit torques reported in metallic systems, showing that the THT may provide a better way for energy-efficient manipulation of magnetization in spintronics devices.},

Microstructures of progressively higher magnetic anisotropy and thus smaller {DW} widths have been studied, including; bcc Fe, hcp Co and L1o {FePt}. The magnetic domain structure of these materials have been investigated using magnetic force microscopy and micromagnetic simulations. In Fe and Co the dominant sources of low-field {MR} are ferromagnetic resistivity anisotropy, due to both anisotropic {MR} ({AMR}) and the Lorentz {MR}. In Fe, at low temperature, a novel negative {DW} contribution to the {MR} has been found. Hcp Co microstructures show a greater resistivity for current perpendicular to {DWs} than for current parallel to {DWs}, that is consistent with a small (positive) {DW} resistivity and a Hall effect mechanism. High anisotropy L1o {FePt} microstructures show strong evidence for an intrinsic {DW} contribution to the resistivity. Related studies and future directions are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Domain-wall memory ({DWM}), an extension to spin transfer torque-magnetic random access memory ({STT}-{MRAM}), stores multiple bits, each bit in an individual domain within a nanowire. The access mechanism of a {DWM} is carried out with the help of an access point orthogonal to the nanowire, similar to a conventional magneto-tunnel junction ({MTJ}) of {STT}-{MRAM}. In this context, the {MTJ} free layer is one of the domains of the nanowire. Prior to an access, the desired bit is brought under the access point by shifting, and then its spin orientation is detected by a traditional sensing circuit or overwritten with a write current. However, the nanowire can also be viewed as a multi-level cell ({MLC})-like device when tested with an end-to-end current. Based on this observation, we devised a novel transverse read ({TR}) technique to detect the number of `1's stored in a {DWM} without shifting any domains. {TR} is non-destructive and requires ultra-low power insomuch as the {TR} current is small compared to the shifting current. The {TR} has interesting applications in {DWM} such as a neuron in a neuromorphic engine, a multi-bit digital storage device, or as a fault tolerance tool for shifting reliability in {DWM} memories. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of {TR} in both perpendicular and in-plane magnetic anisotropy nanowires and determine the critical requirements of successful {TR} operation.},

The proposal is derived from density functional calculations, including a mean field treatment of Hubbard repulsion U, which have been validated by comparison with angle-resolved photoemission data. Ferromagnetism with magnetization along certain directions is shown to lift the Weyl degeneracies, while at the same time inducing texture in the quasiparticle spin polarizations mapped in reciprocal space. In particular, the polarization is attenuated and then rotated from parallel to perpendicular to antiparallel to the magnetization as Weyl points derived from crossing of majority and minority spin bands are traversed.},

We use the nonequilibrium Green function formalism to measure the change in conductance of nanoscale TI and metal interconnects caused by the presence of impurity disorder.

This prompts us to investigate intrinsic spin Hall effect, a transverse phenomenon with identical origin as the intrinsic {AHE}. We report inverse spin Hall effect experiments in nanocrystalline Mn3Sn nanowires at room temperature using spin absorption method, which enables us to quantitatively derive both the spin diffusion length and the spin Hall angle in the same device. We observed clear absorption of the spin current in the Mn3Sn nanowires when kept in contact with the spin transport channel of a lateral spin-valve device. We estimate spin diffusion length λs(Mn3Sn)∼0.75 ± 0.67 nm from the comparison of spin signal of an identical reference lateral spin valve without Mn3Sn nanowire. From inverse spin Hall measurements, we evaluate spin Hall angle θ{SH}∼5.3 ± 2.4 \% and spin Hall conductivity σ{SH}∼46.99 ± 20.63 (ℏe)(Ωcm)−1. The estimated spin Hall conductivity agrees with both in sign and magnitude to the theoretically predicted intrinsic σ{intSH}∼36-96 (ℏ/e) (Ωcm)−1. We also observed anomalous Hall effect at room temperature in nano-Hall bars prepared at the same time as the spin Hall devices. Large anomalous Hall conductivity along with adequate spin Hall conductivity makes Mn3Sn a promising material for ultrafast and ultrahigh-density spintronics devices.},

Although the first inversion breaking Weyl semimetal was recently discovered in TaAs, its magnetic counterparts, i.e., the time-reversal breaking Weyl and nodal line semimetals, remain elusive. They are predicted to exhibit exotic properties distinct from the inversion breaking TSMs including TaAs. In this paper, we identify the magnetic topological semimetal states in the ferromagnetic half-metal compounds Co2TiX (X = Si, Ge, or Sn) with Curie temperatures higher than 350 K. Our first-principles band structure calculations show that, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, Co2TiX features three topological nodal lines. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling gives rise to Weyl nodes, whose momentum space locations can be controlled as a function of themagnetization direction. Our results not only open the door for the experimental realization of topological semimetal states in magnetic materials at room temperature, but also suggest potential applications such as unusual anomalous Hall effect in engineered monolayers of the Co2TiX compounds at high temperature.},

Much of the literature is based on the original MBPT-based approach, and this makes it inaccessible to those unfamiliar with advanced quantum statistical mechanics. We obtain the NEGF equations directly from a one-electron SchrÃ¶dinger equation using relatively elementary arguments. These equations have been used to discuss many problems of great interest such as quantized conductance, (integer) quantum Hall effect, Anderson localization, resonant tunneling, and spin transport without a systematic treatment of many-body effects. But it goes beyond purely coherent transport allowing us to include phase-breaking interactions (both momentum-relaxing and momentum-conserving as well as spin-conserving and spin-relaxing) within a self-consistent Born approximation. We believe that the scope and utility of the NEGF equations transcend the MBPT-based approach originally used to derive it. NEGF teaches us how to combine quantum dynamics with â€œcontactsâ€ much as Boltzmann taught us how to combine classical dynamics with contacts, using the word contacts in a broad figurative sense to denote all kinds of entropy-driven processes. We believe that this approach to â€œcontact-ingâ€ the Schroedinger equation should be of broad interest to anyone working on device physics or nonequilibrium statistical mechanics in general.},

Spintronic devices—which benefit from high endurance, low power consumption, low latency, and CMOS compatibility—are a promising technology for memory, and domain-wall magnetic tunnel junction (DW-MTJ) devices have been shown to implement synaptic functions such as long-term potentiation and spike-timing dependent plasticity. In this work, we propose a notched DW-MTJ synapse as a candidate for supervised learning. Using micromagnetic simulations at room temperature, we show that notched synapses ensure the non-volatility of the synaptic weight and allow for highly linear, symmetric, and reproducible weight updates using either spin transfer torque (STT) or spin–orbit torque (SOT) mechanisms of DW propagation. We use lookup tables constructed from micromagnetics simulations to model the training of neural networks built with DW-MTJ synapses on both the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST image classification tasks. Accounting for thermal noise and realistic process variations, the DW-MTJ devices achieve classification accuracy close to ideal floating-point updates using both STT and SOT devices at room temperature and at 400 K. Our work establishes the basis for a magnetic artificial synapse that can eventually lead to hardware neural networks with fully spintronic matrix operations implementing machine learning.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the recent discovery of the Mott insulating phase and unconventional superconductivity due to the flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene, we propose more generic ways of getting two-dimensional (2D) emergent flat-band lattices using either 2D Dirac materials or ordinary electron gas (2DEG) subject to moderate periodic orbital magnetic fields with zero spatial average. We find stark contrast between Schrödinger and Dirac electrons, i.e., the former show recurring “magic” values of the magnetic field when the lowest band becomes flat, whereas, for the latter, the zero-energy bands are asymptotically flat without magicness. By examining the Wannier functions localized by the smooth periodic magnetic fields, we are able to explain these nontrivial behaviors using minimal tight-binding models on a square lattice. In particular the magicness of the 2DEG can be understood in terms of destructive quantum interference similar to classic flat-band lattice models. The two cases can be interpolated by varying the g factor or effective mass of a 2DEG and by taking into account the Zeeman coupling, which also leads to flat bands with nonzero Chern numbers for each spin. Our paper provides flexible platforms for exploring interaction-driven phases in 2D systems with on-demand superlattice symmetries.},

	abstract = {Magnetic Weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry are expected to generate strong intrinsic anomalous Hall effects, due to their large Berry curvature. Here, we report a magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate, Co3Sn2S2, with a quasi-two-dimensional crystal structure consisting of stacked kagome lattices. This lattice provides an excellent platform for hosting exotic topological quantum states. We observe a negative magnetoresistance that is consistent with the chiral anomaly expected from the presence of Weyl fermions close to the Fermi level. The anomalous Hall conductivity is robust against both increased temperature and charge conductivity, which corroborates the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism in momentum space. Owing to the low carrier density in this material and the considerably enhanced Berry curvature from its band structure, the anomalous Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall angle simultaneously reach 1,130 Ω−1 cm−1 and 20\%, respectively, an order of magnitude larger than typical magnetic systems. Combining the kagome-lattice structure and the long-range out-of-plane ferromagnetic order of Co3Sn2S2, we expect that this material is an excellent candidate for observation of the quantum anomalous Hall state in the two-dimensional limit.},

	abstract = {The antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Mn3Sn has been shown to generate strong intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) at room temperature, due to large momentum-space Berry curvature from the time-reversal symmetry-breaking electronic bands of the Kagome planes. This prompts us to investigate intrinsic spin Hall effect, a transverse phenomenon with identical origin as the intrinsic AHE. We report inverse spin Hall effect experiments in nanocrystalline Mn3Sn nanowires at room temperature using spin absorption method, which enables us to quantitatively derive both the spin diffusion length and the spin Hall angle in the same device. We observed clear absorption of the spin current in the Mn3Sn nanowires when kept in contact with the spin transport channel of a lateral spin-valve device. We estimate spin diffusion length λs(Mn3Sn)∼0.75 ± 0.67 nm from the comparison of spin signal of an identical reference lateral spin valve without Mn3Sn nanowire. From inverse spin Hall measurements, we evaluate spin Hall angle θSH∼5.3 ± 2.4 \% and spin Hall conductivity σSH∼46.99 ± 20.63 (ℏe)(Ωcm)−1. The estimated spin Hall conductivity agrees with both in sign and magnitude to the theoretically predicted intrinsic σintSH∼36-96 (ℏ/e) (Ωcm)−1. We also observed anomalous Hall effect at room temperature in nano-Hall bars prepared at the same time as the spin Hall devices. Large anomalous Hall conductivity along with adequate spin Hall conductivity makes Mn3Sn a promising material for ultrafast and ultrahigh-density spintronics devices.},

%	abstract = {The spin-transfer torque is a fundamental physical quantity to operate the spintronics devices such as racetrack memory. We theoretically study the spin-transfer torque and analyze the dynamics of the magnetic domain walls in magnetic Weyl semimetals. Owing to the strong spin-orbit coupling in Weyl semimetals, the spin-transfer torque can be significantly enhanced, because of which they can provide a more efficient means of controlling magnetic textures. We derive the analytical expression of the spin-transfer torque and find that the velocity of the domain wall is one order of magnitude greater than that of conventional ferromagnetic metals. Furthermore, due to the suppression of longitudinal conductivity in the thin domain-wall configuration, the dissipation due to Joule heating for the spin-transfer torque becomes much smaller than that in bulk metallic ferromagnets. Consequently, the fast-control of the domain wall can be achieved with smaller dissipation from Joule heating in the Weyl semimetals as required for application to low-energy-consumption spintronics devices.},

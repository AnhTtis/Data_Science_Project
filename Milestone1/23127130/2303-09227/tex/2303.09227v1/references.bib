abstract="There is an increasing demand for more autonomous systems. Enhancing systems with self-aware and self-adaptation capabilities can provide a solution to meet resilience needs. This article proposes a general design solution to build autonomous systems capable of run-time reconfiguration. The solution leverages Model-Driven Engineering with Model-Based Cognitive Control. The key idea is the integration of a metacontroller in the control architecture of the autonomous system, capable of perceiving the dysfunctional components of the control system and reconfiguring it, if necessary, at runtime. At the core of the metacontroller's operation lies a model of the system's functional architecture, which can be generated from the engineering modeling of the system.",

	Abstract = {Providing assurances for self-adaptive systems is challenging. A primary underlying problem is uncertainty that may stem from a variety of different sources, ranging from incomplete knowledge to sensor noise and uncertain behavior of humans in the loop. Providing assurances that the self-adaptive system complies with its requirements calls for an enduring process spanning the whole lifetime of the system. In this process, humans and the system jointly derive and integrate new evidence and arguments, which we coined perpetual assurances for self-adaptive systems. In this paper, we provide a background framework and the foundation for perpetual assurances for self-adaptive systems. We elaborate on the concrete challenges of offering perpetual assurances, requirements for solutions, realization techniques and mechanisms to make solutions suitable. We also present benchmark criteria to compare solutions. We then present a concrete exemplar that researchers can use to assess and compare approaches for perpetual assurances for self-adaptation.},

@inproceedings{Bozhinoski-2021,
	Abstract = {Without prior knowledge of the environment, a software agent can learn to achieve
a goal using machine learning. Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used
to make the agent explore the environment and learn to achieve its goal by trial and
error. Discovering effective policies to achieve the goal in a complex environment
is a major challenge for RL. Furthermore, in safety-critical applications, such as
robotics, an unsafe action may cause catastrophic consequences in the agent or in
the environment. In this paper, we present an approach that uses runtime monitoring
to prevent the reinforcement learning agent to perform "wrong" actions and to exploit
prior knowledge to smartly explore the environment. Each monitor is defined by a property
that we want to enforce to the agent and a context. The monitors are orchestrated
by a meta-monitor that activates and deactivates them dynamically according to the
context in which the agent is learning. We have evaluated our approach by training
the agent in randomly generated learning environments. Our results show that our approach
blocks the agent from performing dangerous and safety-critical actions in all the
generated environments. Besides, our approach helps the agent to achieve its goal
faster by providing feedback and shaping its reward during learning.},

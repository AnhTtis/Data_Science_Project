    "abstract": "We characterize totally symmetric self-complementary plane partitions (TSSCPP) as bounded compatible sequences satisfying a Yamanouchi-like condition. As such, they are in bijection with certain pipe dreams. Using this characterization and the recent bijection of [Gao-Huang] between reduced pipe dreams and reduced bumpless pipe dreams, we give a bijection between alternating sign matrices and TSSCPP in the reduced, 1432-avoiding case. We also give a different bijection in the 1432- and 2143-avoiding case that preserves natural poset structures on the associated pipe dreams and bumpless pipe dreams.",

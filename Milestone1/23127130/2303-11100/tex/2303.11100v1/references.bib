   abstract = {Deep neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been widely adopted for human activity recognition in recent years. They have attained significant performance improvement over traditional techniques due to their strong feature representation capabilities. Some of the challenges faced by the HAR community is the non-availability of a substantial amount of labeled training samples, and the higher computational cost and system resources requirements of deep learning architectures as opposed to shallow learning algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose an attention-based multi-head model for human activity recognition (HAR). This framework contains three lightweight convolutional heads, with each head designed using one-dimensional CNN to extract features from sensory data. The lightweight multi-head model is induced with attention to strengthen the representation ability of CNN, allowing for automatic selection of salient features and suppress unimportant ones. We conducted ablation studies and experiments on two publicly available benchmark datasets: WISDM and UCI HAR, to evaluate our model. The experimental outcome demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in activity recognition and achieves better accuracy while ensuring computational efficiency.},

At present, Recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory in particular, are main approaches in HAR. However, RNN suffers from the fact that it cannot process sequences in parallel and longer sequences cannot be remembered well. Therefore, this paper applies the attention mechanism to explore the relevant time context, and proposes a new model, named DeepConvAttn. DeepConvAttn is based on a well-known deep learning model, DeepConvLSTM. These two models are compared in experiments, and the results show DeepConvAttn is better than DeepConvLSTM on two popular HAR benchmark datasets.},

   abstract = {Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have set latest state-of-the-art on various human activity recognition (HAR) datasets. However, deep CNNs often require more computing resources, which limits their applications in embedded HAR. Although many successful methods have been proposed to reduce memory and FLOPs of CNNs, they often involve special network architectures designed for visual tasks, which are not suitable for deep HAR tasks with time series sensor signals, due to remarkable discrepancy. Therefore, it is necessary to develop lightweight deep models to perform HAR. As filter is the basic unit in constructing CNNs, it deserves further research whether re-designing smaller filters is applicable for deep HAR. In the article, inspired by the idea, we proposed a lightweight CNN using Lego filters for HAR. A set of lower-dimensional filters is used as Lego bricks to be stacked for conventional filters, which does not rely on any special network structure. The local loss function is used to train model. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that proposes lightweight CNN for HAR in ubiquitous and wearable computing arena. The experiment results on five public HAR datasets, UCI-HAR dataset, OPPORTUNITY dataset, UNIMIB-SHAR dataset, PAMAP2 dataset, and WISDM dataset collected from either smartphones or multiple sensor nodes, indicate that our novel Lego CNN with local loss can greatly reduce memory and computation cost over CNN, while achieving higher accuracy. That is to say, the proposed model is smaller, faster and more accurate. Finally, we evaluate the actual performance on an Android smartphone.},

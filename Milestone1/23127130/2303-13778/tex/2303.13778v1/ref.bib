abstract = {We propose a class of mathematical models for the transmission of infectious diseases in large populations. This class of models, which generalizes the existing discrete-time Markov chain models of infectious diseases, is compatible with efficient dynamic optimization techniques to assist real-time selection and modification of public health interventions in response to evolving epidemiological situations and changing availability of information and medical resources. While retaining the strength of existing classes of mathematical models in their ability to represent the within-host natural history of disease and between-host transmission dynamics, the proposed models possess two advantages over previous models: (1) these models can be used to generate optimal dynamic health policies for controlling spreads of infectious diseases, and (2) these models are able to approximate the spread of the disease in relatively large populations with a limited state space size and computation time.}

    abstract = "{Spreading processes are ubiquitous in natural and artificial systems. They can be studied via a plethora of models, depending on the specific details of the phenomena under study. Disease contagion and rumour spreading are among the most important of these processes due to their practical relevance. However, despite the similarities between them, current models address both spreading dynamics separately. In this article, we propose a general spreading model that is based on discrete time Markov chains. The model includes all the transitions that are plausible for both a disease contagion process and rumour propagation. We show that our model not only covers the traditional spreading schemes but that it also contains some features relevant in social dynamics, such as apathy, forgetting, and lost/recovering of interest. The model is evaluated analytically to obtain the spreading thresholds and the early time dynamical behaviour for the contact and reactive processes in several scenarios. Comparison with Monte Carlo simulations shows that the Markov chain formalism is highly accurate while it excels in computational efficiency. We round off our work by showing how the proposed framework can be applied to the study of spreading processes occurring on social networks.}",

title = "General asymptotic {B}ayesian theory of quickest change detection",
abstract = "The optimal detection procedure for detecting changes in independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequences in a Bayesian setting was derived by Shiryaev in the 1960s. However, the analysis of the performance of this procedure in terms of the average detection delay and false alarm probability has been an open problem. In this paper, we develop a general asymptotic change-point detection theory that is not limited to a restrictive i.i.d. assumption. In particular, we investigate the performance of the Shiryaev procedure for general discrete-time stochastic models in the asymptotic setting, where the false alarm probability approaches zero. We show that the Shiryaev procedure is asymptotically optimal in the general non-i.i.d. case under mild conditions. We also show that the two popular non-Bayesian detection procedures, namely the Page and the Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak procedures, are generally not optimal (even asymptotically) under the Bayesian criterion. The results of this study are shown to be especially important in studying the asymptotics of decentralized change detection procedures.",

	Abstract = {This paper considers a multiple stopping time problem for a Markov chain observed in noise, where a decision maker chooses at most L stopping times to maximize a cumulative objective. We formulate the problem as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and derive structural results for the optimal multiple stopping policy. The main results are as follows: (i) The optimal multiple stopping policy is shown to be characterized by threshold curves Γl, for l=1,{\ldots},L, in the unit simplex of Bayesian Posteriors. (ii) The stopping sets Sl (defined by the threshold curves Γl) are shown to exhibit the following nested structure Sl−1⊂Sl. (iii) The optimal cumulative reward is shown to be monotone with respect to the copositive ordering of the transition matrix. (iv) A stochastic gradient algorithm is provided for estimating linear threshold policies by exploiting the structural results. These linear threshold policies approximate the threshold curves Γl, and share the monotone structure of the optimal multiple stopping policy. (v) Application of the multiple stopping framework to interactively schedule advertisements in live online social media. It is shown that advertisement scheduling using multiple stopping performs significantly better than currently used methods.},

abstract = {{Automated airborne collision-detection systems are a key enabling technology for facilitating the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into the national airspace. These safety-critical systems must be sensitive enough to provide timely warnings of genuine airborne collision threats, but not so sensitive as to cause excessive false alarms. Hence, an accurate characterization of detection and false-alarm sensitivity is essential for understanding performance tradeoffs, and system designers can exploit this characterization to help achieve a desired balance in system performance. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate a sky-region, image-based, aircraft collision-detection system that is based on morphological and temporal processing techniques. (Note that the examined detection approaches are not suitable for the detection of potential collision threats against a ground clutter background.) A novel collection methodology for collecting realistic airborne collision-course target footage in both head-on and tail-chase engagement geometries is described. Under (hazy) blue sky conditions, our proposed system achieved detection ranges greater than 1540 m in three flight test cases with no false-alarm events in 14.14 h of nontarget data (under cloudy conditions, the system achieved detection ranges greater than 1170 m in four flight test cases with no false-alarm events in 6.63 h of nontarget data). Importantly, this paper is the first documented presentation of detection range versus false-alarm curves generated from airborne target and nontarget image data.

Manually selecting suitable static detection thresholds is challenging (and currently requires highly trained operators) because it involves balancing trade-offs between detection and false alarm performance in different image sensing conditions. In this paper, we exploit recent work on the characterisation of vision-based aircraft detection problems in the sky-region to propose an adaptive threshold selection approach. Using data sets captured during flight experiments, we show that our proposed adaptive threshold approach can enable improved detection range performance compared to manually selected static thresholds.},

@article{Geyer2009,
abstract = {In this technical report we describe our efforts towards a field deployable Sense and Avoid system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which uses passive vision as the main sensing modality. The ability of UAVs to operate safely in the presence of other air traffic is critical towards acceptance of UAVs in civilian and military airspace. This will allow UAVs to be used to their fullest potential. In order to operate freely in the presence of manned airborne traffic UAVs must demonstrate a Sense and Avoid capability that meets or exceeds that of an equivalent human pilot. Furthermore this capability should be achieved without the use of cooperative communication with other aircraft or prior knowledge of other aircrafts' flight plans. We describe our collision avoidance algorithm and software-in-the- loop testing, vision based detection method with a 98{\%} detection rate out to a range of 4.5 miles which exceeds the FAA regulation of 3 statute miles. A field deployable Sense and Avoid system must be able to operate with consistent performance across a variety of atmospheric conditions including cloud, fog and haze of various degrees that can occur under conditions commonly described as Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). In order to model the effect of all these conditions on the performance of the detection system we developed an atmospheric image formation modelling system that takes as inputs weather conditions and can predict the appearance of the image of an aircraft of given geometry at various ranges. This predictive model also determines the minimum resolution needed to guarantee the required detection performance. Passive vision provides the bearing to the intruding aircraft. Range estimation is only possible by executing additional maneuvers which causes significant mission interference. We investigate the feasibilty of a flash lidar system that can be used as a confirming sensor to further reduce the false positive rate and provide range of the intruding aircraft. 1},

@article{Premkumar,
abstract = {We consider the problem of quickest transient change detection under a Bayesian setting. The change occurs at a random time $\Gamma$1 and disappears at a random time $\Gamma$2 {\textgreater} $\Gamma$1. Thus, at any time k, the system can be in one of the following states, i) prechange, ii) in–change, and iii) out–of–change. We model the evolution of the state by a Markov chain. The state of the system can only be observed partially from the observations which are obtained sequentially. We formulate the quickest transient change detection problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and obtain the following detection rules for a target probability of false alarm P FA $\alpha$, 1. MinD (Minimum Detection Delay), which minimizes the mean detection delay E DD 2. A–MinD (Asymptotic Minimum Detection Delay), which is an asymptotic version of the procedure MinD when the mean time until the occurrence of change, $\Gamma$ , goes to infinity 3. MaxP (Maximum Probability of Detection), which maximizes the probability of detection P D . We provide numerical examples to illustrate performance of the procedures we propose. We also com-pare our procedures with the CUSUM procedure for this problem which is known to be optimal under an appropriately defined minimax setting. Our numerical results show that while MinD achieves the least E DD across all events, the CUSUM procedure outperforms MinD when we consider only the events that are stopped in the in–change state.},

@book{Tartakovsky2014,
abstract = {"A CRC title." Sequential Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Changepoint Detection systematically develops the theory of sequential hypothesis testing and quickest changepoint detection. It also describes important applications in which theoretical results can be used efficiently. The book reviews recent accomplishments in hypothesis testing and changepoint detection both in decision-theoretic (Bayesian) and non-decision-theoretic (non-Bayesian) contexts. The authors not only emphasize traditional binary hypotheses but also substantially more difficult multiple decision proble. 1. Motivation for the sequential approach and selected applications -- 2.

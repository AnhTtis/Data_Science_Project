    "abstract": "This paper establishes that an exactly optimal rule for Bayesian Quickest Change Detection (QCD) of Markov chains is a threshold test on the no change posterior. We also provide a computationally efficient scalar filter for the no change posterior whose effort is independent of the dimension of the chains. We establish that an (undesirable) weak practical super-martingale phenomenon can be exhibited by the no change posterior when the before and after chains are too close in a relative entropy rate sense. The proposed detector is examined in simulation studies.",

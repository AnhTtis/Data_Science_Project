    "abstract": "We prove existence of infinite volume $d$-dimensional Coulomb gases which are not number rigid for $d \\geq 3$. This makes the Coulomb gas the Gibbs point process with the longest range pairwise interaction (i.e.\\ with the smallest $s$ in the interaction kernel $g(x) = |x|^{-s}$) for which number non-rigidity has been proved in $d \\geq 3$. We rule out properties stronger than number rigidity for the two-dimensional Coulomb gas.",

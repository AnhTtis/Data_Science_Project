% Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a popular method for modeling and rendering 3D scenes with photo-realistic quality. However, NeRF models often struggle to accurately represent glossy surfaces with high specular reflectance. In this paper, we aim to achieve high-quality rendering and surface reconstruction for shiny objects. Based on this high-quality geometry reconstruction, our method can also achieve more flexible scene illumination editing, including editing the whole environment light. Our model allows for much faster training and rendering with the help of hybrid NeRF models.

% Neural rendering has recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional graphics rendering techniques. 
% However, existing methods struggle with objects that exhibit high specular reflectance, such as glossy surfaces. 
% In this work, we present \model, an implicit neural model that decouples the environment light representation from the neural scene representation to enable high rendering quality, accurate surface geometry, and flexible scene relighting. We achieve this by using a renderer with a neural approximation of the physically based rendering equation. We additionally synthesize the one-bounce inter-reflection from glossy surfaces. Our method outperforms prior methods on challenging shiny scenes, providing high-quality rendering of view-dependent specular reflections and flexible physically based scene editing.


% Reconstructing an object's geometry and appearance from multiview images is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. Recent progress in neural rendering has shown promising results in representing and rendering complex 3D scenes. 
% However, existing methods struggle with objects that exhibit high specular reflectance, such as shiny surfaces. 
% Additionally, high rendering quality often sacrifices the surface geometry, while models with better surface-appearance decomposition have relatively lower rendering quality.
 % Moreover, there is often a trade-off between rendering quality and surface geometry, with models that perform well in one area underperforming in the other. 


Recent advances in neural rendering have shown great potential for reconstructing scenes from multiview images. 
However, accurately representing objects with glossy surfaces remains a challenge for existing methods.
In this work, we introduce \model, a rendering and modeling framework for high-quality rendering and reconstruction of surfaces with challenging specular reflections. 
To achieve this, we first propose a novel neural renderer with decomposed rendering components to learn the interaction between surface and environment lighting. This renderer is trained using existing physically based renderers and is decoupled from actual scene representations. 
We then propose an SDF-based neural surface model that leverages this learned neural renderer to represent general scenes.
Our model additionally synthesizes indirect illuminations caused by inter-reflections from shiny surfaces by marching surface-reflected rays. 
We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-art methods on challenging shiny scenes, providing high-quality rendering of specular reflections while also enabling material editing and scene relighting.

    "abstract": "Let $V$ be a vertex algebra of countable dimension, $G$ a subgroup of ${\\rm Aut} V$ of finite order, $V^{G}$ the fixed point subalgebra of $V$ under the action of $G$, and ${\\mathscr S}$ a finite $G$-stable set of inequivalent irreducible twisted weak $V$-modules associated with possibly different automorphisms in $G$. We show a Schur--Weyl type duality for the actions of ${\\mathscr A}_α(G,{\\mathscr S})$ and $V^G$ on the direct sum of twisted weak $V$-modules in ${\\mathscr S}$ where ${\\mathscr A}_α(G,{\\mathscr S})$ is a finite dimensional semisimple associative algebra associated with $G,{\\mathscr S}$, and a $2$-cocycle $α$ naturally determined by the $G$-action on ${\\mathscr S}$. It follows as a natural consequence of the result that for any $g\\in G$ every irreducible $g$-twisted weak $V$-module is a completely reducible weak $V^G$-module.",

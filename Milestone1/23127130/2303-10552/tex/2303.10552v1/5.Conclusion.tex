\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes a novel intermediate-level cooperative framework called FFNet to address the object detection task in VIC3D. 
The proposed FFNet can effectively overcome the temporal asynchrony challenge and reduce the transmission cost by transmitting the compressed feature flow for cooperative detection. Additionally, a novel self-supervised learning approach is designed to train the feature flow generator.
Experimental results on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate that the FFNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. 
Notably, our approach emphasizes improving feature prediction quality and can complement existing intermediate-level methods. 
Furthermore, our approach can be extended to other modalities, including image and multi-modality data. 
The proposed method can also benefit multi-vehicle cooperative perception. 
Moreover, leveraging additional frames to generate feature flow can enhance the feature prediction ability of our method.
In summary, the proposed FFNet with feature prediction and self-supervised learning is a promising approach for VIC3D object detection, and can potentially be applied to various cooperative perception tasks in the future.

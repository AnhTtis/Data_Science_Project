\begin{abstract}
Cooperatively utilizing both ego-vehicle and infrastructure sensor data can significantly enhance autonomous driving perception abilities. However, temporal asynchrony and limited wireless communication in traffic environments can lead to fusion misalignment and impact detection performance. This paper proposes Feature Flow Net (FFNet), a novel cooperative detection framework that uses a feature flow prediction module to address these issues in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D object detection. Rather than transmitting feature maps extracted from still-images, FFNet transmits feature flow, which leverages the temporal coherence of sequential infrastructure frames to predict future features and compensate for asynchrony. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised approach to enable FFNet to generate feature flow with feature prediction ability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing cooperative detection methods while requiring no more than 1/10 transmission cost of raw data on the DAIR-V2X dataset when temporal asynchrony exceeds 200$ms$. 
The code is available at \href{https://github.com/haibao-yu/FFNet-VIC3D}{https://github.com/haibao-yu/FFNet-VIC3D}.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by

% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.

    "abstract": "Fluid flow networks are ubiquitous and can be found in a broad range of contexts, from human-made systems such as water supply networks to living systems like animal and plant vasculature. In many cases, the elements forming these networks exhibit a highly non-linear pressure-flow relationship. Although we understand how these elements work individually, their collective behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we combine experiments, theory, and numerical simulations to understand the main mechanisms underlying the collective behavior of soft flow networks with elements that exhibit negative differential resistance. Strikingly, our theoretical analysis and experiments reveal that a minimal network of nonlinear resistors, which we have termed a `fluidic memristor', displays history-dependent resistance. This new class of element can be understood as a collection of hysteresis loops that allows this fluidic system to store information. Our work provides insights that may inform new applications of fluid flow networks in soft materials science, biomedical settings, and soft robotics, and may also motivate new understanding of the flow networks involved in animal and plant physiology.",

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
abstract = {The recent detection of the “cosmic dawn” redshifted 21 cm signal at 78 MHz by the Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signatures (EDGES) differs significantly from theoretical predictions. In particular, the absorption trough is roughly a factor of two stronger than the most optimistic theoretical models. The early interpretations of the origin of this discrepancy fall into two categories. The first is that there is increased cooling of the gas due to interactions with dark matter, while the second is that the background radiation field includes a contribution from a component in addition to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this Letter we examine the feasibility of the second idea using new data from the first station of the Long Wavelength Array. The data span 40–80 MHz and provide important constraints on the present-day background in a frequency range where there are few surveys with absolute temperature calibration suitable for measuring the strength of the radio monopole. We find support for a strong, diffuse radio background that was suggested by the ARCARDE 2 results in the 3–10 GHz range. We find that this background is well modeled by a power law with a spectral index of −2.58 ± 0.05 and a temperature at the rest frame 21 cm frequency of  mK.}

This is consistent with a classical formation mechanism from the agglomeration of the first massive stars in the universe. However, when the masses of the stars approach 106 M⊙, the stars become unstable and collapse, possibly forming the first generation of cosmological black holes. Here, we speculate that the claimed detection of an isotropic radio background may constitute evidence of the formation of these first supermassive black holes, since their data are compatible in spectrum and intensity with synchrotron emission from the remnants. The model proposed fulfils all observational conditions for the background, in terms of single-source strength, number of sources, far-infrared and gamma-ray emission. The observed high-energy neutrino flux is consistent with our calculations in flux and spectrum. The proposal described in this paper may also explain the early formation and growth of massive bulge-less disc galaxies as derived from the massive, gaseous shell formed during the explosion prior to the formation of a supermassive black hole.}",

abstract = {The next generation of astronomical instruments will be able to detect dense pockets of ionized gas created by the first luminous objects. The integrated free-free emission from ionized halos creates a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background, greater than the distortion due to the reionized intergalactic medium. Its detection is well within the capabilities of the planned DIMES satellite. Ionized halos may also be imaged directly in free-free emission by the Square Kilometer Array. Bright halos will be detected as discrete sources, while residual unresolved sources can still be detected statistically from temperature fluctuations in maps. Balmer line emission from ionized halos is detectable by the Next Generation Space Telescope and can be used to obtain redshift information. Unlike Lyα, the Hα line does not suffer from resonant scattering by neutral hydrogen and is still observable when the intergalactic medium is not fully reionized. In addition, it is less susceptible to dust extinction. Finally, the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect may be used to detect ionized gas at high redshift. Used in concert, these observations will probe ionizing emissivity, gas clumping, and star formation in the early universe.}

The damping of fluctuations on scales smaller than the dark matter particle free streaming scale corresponds to a suppression of the total matter power spectrum on large wavenumbers k. We derive the time evolution of the variance of the matter power spectrum for various cosmological models and parameters by numerically computing the power spectrum with a modified version of the Boltzmann code camb, for different values of the cut-off parameter kmax. Suitable analytical approximations of the numerical results are presented. We then characterize the cosmic microwave background (CMB) free–free spectral distortion accounting for the amplification effect coming from clumping factor. Indeed, the clumpiness, associated with the density contrast of the intergalactic medium, increases at decreasing redshift. The analysis is carried out for selected astrophysical and phenomenological cosmological reionization histories for which we evaluate the impact of the clumping factor on the free–free distortion and discuss the wavelength dependence of the predicted signal. Finally, we address a comparison with other classes of unavoidable CMB spectral distortions and future observational perspectives. While Comptonization from reionization is dominant at high frequencies, the free–free signal predicted in the considered models contributes to the distortion at a level of few (few tens) per cent at frequencies below ∼25 GHz (∼10 GHz) and represents the main signature below ∼4 GHz.

abstract = {Abstract A review of the spatially flat cosmological model SU(2)CMB, minimally induced by the postulate that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is subject to an SU(2) rather than a U(1) gauge principle, is given. Cosmological parameter values, which are determined from the Planck CMB power spectra at small angular scales, are compared to their values in spatially flat ΛCDM from both local and global extractions. As a global model SU(2)CMB leans toward local ΛCDM cosmology and is in tension with some global ΛCDM parameter values. Spectral antiscreening / screening effects in SU(2)CMB radiance are presented within the Rayleigh– Jeans regime in dependence on temperature and frequency. Such radiance anomalies can cause CMB large-angle anomalies. Therefore, it is pointed out how SU(2)CMB modifies the Boltzmann equation  for the perturbations of the photon phase space distribution at low redshift and why this requires to the solve the ℓ-hierarchy on a comoving momentum grid (q-grid) for all z.},

Such emission is a combination of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) monopole, Galactic foreground emission, the integrated contribution of radio emission from external galaxies, any spectral distortions present in the CMB, and any other extragalactic source. After removal of estimates of foreground emission from our own Galaxy, and an estimated contribution of external galaxies, we present fits to a combination of the flat-spectrum CMB and potential spectral distortions in the CMB. We find 2σ upper limits to CMB spectral distortions of μ &lt; 6 × 10−4 and |Y ff| &lt; 1 × 10−4. We also find a significant detection of a residual signal beyond that, which can be explained by the CMB plus the integrated radio emission from galaxies estimated from existing surveys. This residual signal may be due to an underestimated galactic foreground contribution, an unaccounted for contribution of a background of radio sources, or some combination of both. The residual signal is consistent with emission in the form of a power law with amplitude 18.4 ± 2.1 K at 0.31 GHz and a spectral index of −2.57 ± 0.05.}

	abstract = {The cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model has been remarkably successful in explaining cosmic structure over an enormous span of redshift, but it has faced persistent challenges from observations that probe the innermost regions of dark matter halos and the properties of the Milky Way{\textquoteright}s dwarf galaxy satellites. We review the current observational and theoretical status of these {\textquotedblleft}small-scale controversies.{\textquotedblright} Cosmological simulations that incorporate only gravity and collisionless CDM predict halos with abundant substructure and central densities that are too high to match constraints from galaxy dynamics. The solution could lie in baryonic physics: Recent numerical simulations and analytical models suggest that gravitational potential fluctuations tied to efficient supernova feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in massive galaxies, and a combination of feedback and low star formation efficiency could explain why most of the dark matter subhalos orbiting the Milky Way do not host visible galaxies. However, it is not clear that this solution can work in the lowest mass galaxies, where discrepancies are observed. Alternatively, the small-scale conflicts could be evidence of more complex physics in the dark sector itself. For example, elastic scattering from strong dark matter self-interactions can alter predicted halo mass profiles, leading to good agreement with observations across a wide range of galaxy mass. Gravitational lensing and dynamical perturbations of tidal streams in the stellar halo provide evidence for an abundant population of low-mass subhalos in accord with CDM predictions. These observational approaches will get more powerful over the next few years.},

\ABSTRACT{%
\noindent{\bf Problem definition:}  The pandemic crisis made apparent the need to take a holistic view of production networks to understand risk factors that arise due to their many interdependent units. We investigate the structural factors contributing to the severity of cascading failures in production networks, how to quantify the effect of these risk factors with resilience metrics, and how to design and evaluate interventions to improve resilience.

\noindent{\bf Methodology/Results:} 
We propose a node percolation process on production networks that models product suppliers failing independently due to exogenous, systemic shocks and causing other products to fail as their production requirements are unmet. We first show that the size of the cascading failures follows a power law in random directed acyclic graphs, whose topology encodes the natural ordering of products from simple raw materials to complex products. This motivates the need for a resilience metric, which we define as the maximum magnitude shock the production network can withstand with only a small fraction of products failing. Next, we study the resilience of several architectures, such as trees, parallel products, and random trellis, and classify them as resilient or fragile depending on their topological attributes. In the next step, we give general lower bounds and optimal interventions for improving resilience as a function of Katz centralities. Finally, we empirically calculate the resilience metric and study interventions in various real-world networks to validate our theoretical results.

% We first show that the size of the cascades follows a power law in random directed acyclic graphs, whose topology encodes the natural ordering of products from simple raw materials to complex products. This motivates the need for a supply chain resilience metric, which we define as the maximum magnitude shock that the production network can withstand such that at least $(1 - \varepsilon)$-fraction of the products are produced with high probability as the size of the production network grows to infinity. Next, we study the resilience of many network architectures and classify them as resilient, where large cascading failures can be avoided almost surely, and fragile, where large cascades are inevitable. In the next step, we give bounds on the expected size of cascading failures in a given production network graph as the solution to a linear program and show that extending the node percolation process to a joint percolation process that affects the nodes and the links of the production network becomes a special instance of the well-studied financial contagion model of Eisenberg and Noe. We show that under certain assumptions, the Katz centrality of each node can be used as a measure of their vulnerability and give general lower bounds as well as optimal interventions for improving resilience as a function of Katz centralities. Finally, to validate our theoretical results, we empirically calculate the resilience metric and study interventions in a variety of real-world networks.

\noindent {\bf Managerial implications:} We offer new thoughts and theories on reasoning about supply chain resilience based on topological attributes such as source dependency and product complexity and propose novel, theory-informed metrics that we evaluate empirically on real-world networks. Our theories also inform intervention designs for improving resilience, not just from a firm’s perspective but also on a national scale.

%We propose a theory-informed resilience metric that reflects the effect of different topological factors, such as network width and depth, and give optimal intervention designs for increased resilience. We also give empirical evidence for the utility of our metrics to measure resilience not just from the perspective of a firm or an industry but also on national scales. We offer new thoughts and theories about how to reason about supply chain resilience based on topological attribute such as network width and depth, and propose theory-informed metrics that are quantifiable on real-world supply chain networks and can explicitly measure how factors such as number of required inputs and supplier affect production network resilience.

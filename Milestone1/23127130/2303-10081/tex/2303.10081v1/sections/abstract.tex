    We study \HYedit{the problem of} verification and synthesis of \emph{robust} control barrier functions (CBF) for control-affine polynomial systems with \HYedit{bounded} additive uncertainty and \HYedit{convex polynomial constraints on the control}. We first formulate robust CBF verification and synthesis as \emph{multilevel} polynomial optimization problems (POP), where verification  optimizes --in three levels-- the uncertainty, control, and state, while synthesis additionally optimizes the parameter of a chosen parametric CBF candidate. We then show that, by invoking the KKT conditions of the inner optimizations over uncertainty and control, the verification problem can be simplified as a \emph{single-level} POP and the synthesis problem reduces to a \emph{min-max} POP. This reduction leads to multilevel semidefinite relaxations. For the verification problem, we apply Lasserre's hierarchy of moment relaxations. For the synthesis problem, \HYedit{we draw connections to existing relaxation techniques for \emph{robust min-max} POP}, which first use sum-of-squares programming to find \emph{increasingly tight} polynomial lower bounds to the unknown \emph{value function} of the verification POP, and then call Lasserre's hierarchy again to maximize the lower bounds. Both semidefinite relaxations guarantee \emph{asymptotic global convergence} to optimality. We provide an in-depth study of our framework on the controlled Van der Pol Oscillator, both with and without additive uncertainty.

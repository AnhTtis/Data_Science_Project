\section{Conclusions}
We formulated robust CBF verification and synthesis as multilevel POPs. We used KKT conditions to eliminate inner problems in closed form, leading to a single-level POP formulation for verification and a min-max POP formulation for synthesis. We designed multilevel semidefinite relaxations to approximately solve both POPs with asymptotic global convergence guarantees. We validated our framework on a controlled Van der Pol oscillator. Future work will investigate extension of our method to verify multiple CBFs.

    "abstract": "We give a valuative criterion for when a smooth algebraic stack with a separated good moduli space is the quotient of a separated Deligne-Mumford stack by a torus. For doing so, we introduce a new class of morphisms, the so-called effective morphisms, which are a generalization of separated morphisms.",

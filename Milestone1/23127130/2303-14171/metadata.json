    "abstract": "We consider an algebra $\\mathscr A$ of Fourier integral operators on $\\mathbb R^n$. It consists of all operators $D: \\mathscr S(\\mathbb R^n)\\to \\mathscr S(\\mathbb R^n)$ on the Schwartz space $\\mathscr S(\\mathbb R^n)$ that can be written as finite sums $$ D= \\sum R_gT_w A, $$ with Shubin type pseudodifferential operators $A$, Heisenberg-Weyl operators $T_w$, $w\\in \\mathbb C^n$, and lifts $R_g$, $g\\in \\mathrm U(n)$, of unitary matrices $g$ on $\\mathbb C^n$ to operators $R_g$ in the complex metaplectic group.\n  For $D \\in \\mathscr A$ and a suitable auxiliary Shubin pseudodifferential operator $H$ we establish expansions for $\\mathop{\\mathrm {Tr}}(D(H-λ)^{-K})$ as $|λ| \\to \\infty$ in a sector of $\\mathbb C$ for sufficiently large $K$ and of $\\mathop{\\mathrm {Tr}}(De^{-tH})$ as $t\\to 0^+$. We also obtain the singularity structure of the meromorphic extension of $z\\mapsto \\mathop{\\mathrm{Tr}}(DH^{-z})$ to $\\mathbb C$.\n  Moreover, we find a noncommutative residue as a suitable coefficient in these expansions and construct from it a family of localized equivariant traces on the algebra.",

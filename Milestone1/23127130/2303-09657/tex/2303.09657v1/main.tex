%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography
%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,

%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and
%% references.  The command \citestyle{authoryear} switches to the
%% "author year" style.
%%
%% If you are preparing content for an event
%% sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, you must use the "author year" style of

%% The "author" command and its associated commands are used to define

%% Of note is the shared affiliation of the first two authors, and the

  \caption{\label{fig:teaser} \name provides a prognostic workflow, methods, and visual components for countering systematic errors under a unified perspective of spurious associations. To tackle systematic errors induced from machine's blind spots (illustrated on the left side), our study promotes (A) an informed practice of a human-in-the-loop workflow where practitioners can diagnose, contrast, and hypothesize "missing" or "misleading" associations between an interpretable concept and a certain class (e.g., grass concept with dogs) from misclassifications via interactive modules. Users are further provided with (C, D, F) a set of proposed statistical methods and (E) a visual summary to validate and mitigate the associations if the target class is associated and attributed to a concept.}

    "abstract": "In this Essay we argue that there are fundamental limits imposed by quantum theory and thermodynamics on spacetime metric reconstruction using localized quantum-mechanical probes: the \"fuzziness\" of spacetime that arise from operational measurement protocols is already present before one reaches the quantum-gravitational regime. We do this by providing a concrete, non-perturbative realization of metric reconstruction using quantum-optical model of particle detectors in relativistic quantum information. The non-perturbative approach allows us to realize a version of \"short-distance physics corresponds to poor statistics\" idea by Kempf, but this occurs way above the Planck scale. These fundamental limitations can be given a holographic dual interpretation using bulk-to-boundary correspondence between scalar correlators in asymptotically flat spacetimes.",

abstract = {Failure patterns in modern parallel and distributed system are not necessarily uniform. The notion of an adversary scheduler is a natural way to extend the classical wait-free and t-faulty models of computation. A well-established way to characterize an adversary is by its set of cores, where a core is any minimal set of processes that cannot all fail in any execution. We show that the protocol complex associated with an adversary is (c-2)-connected, where c is the size of the adversary's smallest core. This implies, among other results, that such an adversary can solve c-set agreement, but not (c-1)-set agreement. The proofs are combinatorial, relying on a novel application of the Nerve Theorem of modern combinatorial topology.},

abstract = {In an asynchronous distributed system where any number of processes may crash, a process may have to run solo, computing its local output without receiving any information from other processes. In the basic shared memory system where the processes communicate through atomic read/write registers, at most one process may run solo. This paper introduces the family of d-solo models, where d-processes may concurrently run solo, 1≤d≤n (the 1-solo model is the basic read/write model). The paper then studies distributed colorless computations in the d-solo models, where process ids are not used, either in task specifications or during computation. It presents a characterization of the colorless tasks that can be solved in each d-solo model. Colorless tasks include consensus, set agreement and many other previously studied tasks. It shows that colorless algorithms have limited computational power for solving tasks, only when d>1. When d=1, colorless algorithms can solve the same tasks as algorithms that may use ids. It is well-known that, while consensus is not wait-free solvable in a model where at most one process may run solo, ϵ-approximate agreement is solvable. In a d-solo model, the fundamental solvable task is (d,ϵ)-solo approximate agreement, a generalization of ϵ-approximate agreement. Indeed, (d,ϵ)-solo approximate agreement can be solved in the d-solo model, but not in the (d+1)-solo model. Finally, the paper studies a link between the solvability of d-set agreement and (d,ϵ)-solo approximate agreement in asynchronous wait-free message-passing systems, which provides an insight on the “maximal partitioning” allowed to solve an approximate agreement task.}

If task T reduces to task S, and T is impossible to solve, then so is S. Extension-based proofs demonstrate the impossibility of solving a task in a wait-free manner by constructing an infinite execution. It is known that extension-based proofs are limited in power: there is no extension-based proof of the impossibility of a wait-free protocol in the NIS model for k-set agreement among n &gt; k ≥ 2 processes.We introduce augmented extension-based proofs, which generalize extension-based proofs by providing a new type of query. For a general class of reductions, we prove that, if T reduces to S, and T has an augmented extension-based proof that it is impossible to solve in the NIS model, then so does S. Since there is also no augmented extension-based proof of the impossibility of a wait-free protocol in the NIS model for k-set agreement among n &gt; k ≥ 2 processes, it follows that there are no (augmented) extension-based proofs of the impossibility of wait-free protocols in the NIS model for a number of other distributed computing problems.},

abstract = {Approximate agreement is one of the few variants of consensus that can be solved in a wait-free manner in asynchronous systems where processes communicate by reading and writing to shared memory. In this work, we consider a natural generalisation of approximate agreement on arbitrary undirected connected graphs. Each process is given a vertex of the graph as input and, if non-faulty, must output a vertex such thatall the outputs are within distance 1 of one another, andeach output value lies on a shortest path between two input values.From prior work, it is known that there is no wait-free algorithm among n≥3 processes for this problem on any cycle of length c≥4, by reduction from 2-set agreement (Casta\~{n}eda et al. 2018).In this work, we investigate the solvability and complexity of this task on general graphs. We give a new, direct proof of the impossibility of approximate agreement on cycles of length c≥4, via a generalisation of Sperner’s Lemma to convex polygons. We also extend the reduction from 2-set agreement to a larger class of graphs, showing that approximate agreement on these graphs is unsolvable. On the positive side, we present a wait-free algorithm for a class of graphs that properly contains the class of chordal graphs.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a general formulation of atomic snapshot memory, a shared memory partitioned into words written (updated) by individual processes, or instantaneously read (scanned) in its entirety. This paper presents three wait-free implementations of atomic snapshot memory. The first implementation in this paper uses unbounded (integer) fields in these registers, and is particularly easy to understand. The second implementation uses bounded registers. Its correctness proof follows the ideas of the unbounded implementation. Both constructions implement a single-writer snapshot memory, in which each word may be updated by only one process, from single-writer, n-reader registers. The third algorithm implements a multi-writer snapshot memory from atomic n-writer, n-reader registers, again echoing key ideas from the earlier constructions. All operations require Θ(n2) reads and writes to the component shared registers in the worst case. —Authors' Abstract},

abstract = {A wait-free implementation of a concurrent data object is one that guarantees that any process can complete any operation in a finite number of steps, regardless of the execution speeds of the other processes. The problem of constructing a wait-free implementation of one data object from another lies at the heart of much recent work in concurrent algorithms, concurrent data structures, and multiprocessor architectures. First, we introduce a simple and general technique, based on reduction to a concensus protocol, for proving statements of the form, “there is no wait-free implementation of X by Y.” We derive a hierarchy of objects such that no object at one level has a wait-free implementation in terms of objects at lower levels. In particular, we show that atomic read/write registers, which have been the focus of much recent attention, are at the bottom of the hierarchy: thay cannot be used to construct wait-free implementations of many simple and familiar data types. Moreover, classical synchronization primitives such astest&amp;set and fetch&amp;add, while more powerful than read and write, are also computationally weak, as are the standard message-passing primitives. Second, nevertheless, we show that there do exist simple universal objects from which one can construct a wait-free implementation of any sequential object.},

    abstract = {In the classical consensus problem, each of n processors receives a private input value and produces a decision value which is one of the original input values, with the requirement that all processors decide the same value. A central result in distributed computing is that, in several standard models including the asynchronous shared-memory model, this problem has no deterministic solution. The k -set agreement problem is a generalization of the classical consensus proposed by Chaudhuri [ Inform. and Comput. , 105 (1993), pp. 132--158], where the agreement condition is weakened so that the decision values produced may be different, as long as the number of distinct values is at most k . For $n&gt;kgeq 2$ it was not known whether this problem is solvable deterministically in the asynchronous shared memory model. In this paper, we resolve this question by showing that for any k &lt; n , there is no deterministic wait-free protocol for n processors that solves the k -set agreement problem. The proof technique is new: it is based on the development of a topological structure on the set of possible processor schedules of a protocol. This topological structure has a natural interpretation in terms of the knowledge of the processors of the state of the system. This structure reveals a close analogy between the impossibility of wait-free k -set agreement and the Brouwer fixed point theorem for the k -dimensional ball.},

    abstract = { This paper presents a self-contained study of wait-free solvable tasks. A new necessary condition for wait-free solvability, based on a restricted set of executions, is proved. This set of executions induces a very simple-to-understand structure, which is used to prove tight bounds for k-set consensus and renaming. The framework is based on topology, but uses only elementary combinatorics, and, in contrast to previous works, does not rely on algebraic or geometric arguments. }

abstract = {Renaming and set agreement are two fundamental sub-consensus tasks. In the M-renaming task, processes start with names from a large domain and must decide on distinct names in a range of size M; in the k-set agreement task, processes must decide on at most k of their input values. Renaming and set agreement are representatives of the classes of colored and colorless tasks, respectively.This paper presents simple proofs for key impossibility results for wait-free computation using only read and write operations: n processes cannot solve (n−1)-set agreement, and, if n is a prime power, n processes cannot solve (2n−2)-renaming.Our proofs consider a restricted set of executions, and combine simple operational properties of these executions with elementary counting arguments, to show the existence of an execution violating the task's requirements. This makes the proofs easier to understand, verify, and hopefully, extend.},

abstract = {Round-based models are very common message-passing models; combinatorial topology applied to distributed computing provides sweeping results like general lower bounds. We combine both to study the computability of k-set agreement.Among all the possible round-based models, we consider oblivious ones, where the constraints are given only round per round by a set of allowed graphs. And among oblivious models, we focus on closed-above ones, that is models where the set of possible graphs contains all graphs with more edges than some starting graphs. These capture intuitively the underlying structure required by some communication model, like containing a ring.We then derive lower bounds and upper bounds in one round for k-set agreement, such that these bounds are proved using combinatorial topology but stated only in terms of graph properties. These bounds extend to multiple rounds when limiting our algorithms to be oblivious - recalling only pairs of processes and initial value, not who send what and when.},

    abstract = { This paper introduces the use of topological models and methods, formerly used to analyze computability, as tools for the quantification and classification of asynchronous complexity. We present the first asynchronous complexity theorem, applied to decision tasks in the iterated immediate snapshot (IIS) model of Borowsky and Gafni. We do so by introducing a novel form of topological tool called the nonuniform chromatic subdivision. Building on the framework of Herlihy and Shavit’s topological computability model, our theorem states that the time complexity of any asynchronous algorithm is directly proportional to the level of nonuniform chromatic subdivisions necessary to allow a simplicial map from a task’s input complex to its output complex. To show the power of our theorem, we use it to derive a new tight bound on the time to achieve n process approximate agreement in the IIS model: \$\bigl\lceil \log\_d \frac{\max\\_input - \min\\_input}{\epsilon} \bigr\rceil\$, where \$d = 3\$ for two processes and \$d = 2\$ for three or more. This closes an intriguing gap between the known upper and lower bounds implied by the work of Aspnes and Herlihy. More than the new bounds themselves, the importance of our asynchronous complexity theorem is that the algorithms and lower bounds it allows us to derive are intuitive and simple, with topological proofs that require no mention of concurrency at all. }

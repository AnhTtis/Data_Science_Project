    abstract = {In the theory of distributed computing, the notion of a reduction is a common tool for proving impossibility results. If task T reduces to task S, and T is impossible to solve, then so is S. Extension-based proofs demonstrate the impossibility of solving a task in a wait-free manner by constructing an infinite execution. It is known that extension-based proofs are limited in power: there is no extension-based proof of the impossibility of a wait-free protocol in the NIS model for k-set agreement among n &gt; k ≥ 2 processes.We introduce augmented extension-based proofs, which generalize extension-based proofs by providing a new type of query. For a general class of reductions, we prove that, if T reduces to S, and T has an augmented extension-based proof that it is impossible to solve in the NIS model, then so does S. Since there is also no augmented extension-based proof of the impossibility of a wait-free protocol in the NIS model for k-set agreement among n &gt; k ≥ 2 processes, it follows that there are no (augmented) extension-based proofs of the impossibility of wait-free protocols in the NIS model for a number of other distributed computing problems.},

    abstract = {In the classical consensus problem, each of n processors receives a private input value and produces a decision value which is one of the original input values, with the requirement that all processors decide the same value. A central result in distributed computing is that, in several standard models including the asynchronous shared-memory model, this problem has no deterministic solution. The k -set agreement problem is a generalization of the classical consensus proposed by Chaudhuri [ Inform. and Comput. , 105 (1993), pp. 132--158], where the agreement condition is weakened so that the decision values produced may be different, as long as the number of distinct values is at most k . For $n&gt;kgeq 2$ it was not known whether this problem is solvable deterministically in the asynchronous shared memory model. In this paper, we resolve this question by showing that for any k &lt; n , there is no deterministic wait-free protocol for n processors that solves the k -set agreement problem. The proof technique is new: it is based on the development of a topological structure on the set of possible processor schedules of a protocol. This topological structure has a natural interpretation in terms of the knowledge of the processors of the state of the system. This structure reveals a close analogy between the impossibility of wait-free k -set agreement and the Brouwer fixed point theorem for the k -dimensional ball.},

abstract = {Renaming and set agreement are two fundamental sub-consensus tasks. In the M-renaming task, processes start with names from a large domain and must decide on distinct names in a range of size M; in the k-set agreement task, processes must decide on at most k of their input values. Renaming and set agreement are representatives of the classes of colored and colorless tasks, respectively.This paper presents simple proofs for key impossibility results for wait-free computation using only read and write operations: n processes cannot solve (n−1)-set agreement, and, if n is a prime power, n processes cannot solve (2n−2)-renaming.Our proofs consider a restricted set of executions, and combine simple operational properties of these executions with elementary counting arguments, to show the existence of an execution violating the task's requirements. This makes the proofs easier to understand, verify, and hopefully, extend.},

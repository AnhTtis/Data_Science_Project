\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
We proposed \Ours{}, a text-conditioned and training-free method that injects model-based human body prior to improve human-centric generation of state-of-the-art text-conditioned and pose-conditioned generative models. Further, \Ours{} demonstrates excellent utility in a challenging downstream task, single-view HMR.
For future work, we anticipate further investigation into the obstacles associated with human generation in foundation generative models, as well as exploring innovative ways of using generative models to tackle the challenges in 3D human perception tasks.

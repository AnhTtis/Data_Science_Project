    "abstract": "In a series of two articles, we propose a comprehensive mathematical framework for Coupled-Cluster-type methods. In this second part, we analyze the nonlinear equations of the single-reference Coupled-Cluster method using topological degree theory. We establish existence results and qualitative information about the solutions of these equations that also sheds light on the numerically observed behavior. In particular, we compute the topological index of the zeros of the single-reference Coupled-Cluster mapping. For the truncated Coupled-Cluster method, we derive an energy error bound for approximate eigenstates of the Schrodinger equation.",

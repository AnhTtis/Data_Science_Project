    "abstract": "Blazars have been pointed out as promising high-energy (HE) neutrinos sources, although the mechanism is still under debate. The blazars with a hard-TeV spectrum, which leptonic models can hardly explain, can be successfully interpreted in the hadronic scenarios. Recently, Aguilar et al. proposed a lepto-hadronic two-zone model to explain the multi-wavelength observations of the six best-known extreme BL Lacs and showed that the hadronic component could mainly interpret very-high-energy (VHE) emission. In this work, we apply this hadronic model to describe the VHE gamma-ray fluxes of 14 extreme BL Lacs and estimate the respective HE neutrino flux from charge-pion decay products. Finally, we compare our result with the diffuse flux observed by the IceCube telescope, showing that the neutrino fluxes from these objects are negligible.",

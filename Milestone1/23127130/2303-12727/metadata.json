    "abstract": "As fatigue is normally revealed in the eyes and mouth of a person's face, this paper tried to construct a XGBoost Algorithm-Based fatigue recognition model using the two indicators, EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) and MAR(Mouth Aspect Ratio). With an accuracy rate of 87.37% and sensitivity rate of 89.14%, the model was proved to be efficient and valid for further applications.",

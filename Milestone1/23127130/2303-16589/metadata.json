    "abstract": "Owing to their remarkable learning (and relearning) capabilities, deep neural networks (DNNs) find use in numerous real-world applications. However, the learning of these data-driven machine learning models is generally as good as the data available to them for training. Hence, training datasets with long-tail distribution pose a challenge for DNNs, since the DNNs trained on them may provide a varying degree of classification performance across different output classes. While the overall bias of such networks is already highlighted in existing works, this work identifies the node bias that leads to a varying sensitivity of the nodes for different output classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work highlighting this unique challenge in DNNs, discussing its probable causes, and providing open challenges for this new research direction. We support our reasoning using an empirical case study of the networks trained on a real-world dataset.",

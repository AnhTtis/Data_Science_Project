    "abstract": "Steady surface waves in a two-dimensional channel are considered. We study bifurcations, which occur on a branch of Stokes water waves starting from a uniform stream solution. Two types of bifurcations are considered: bifurcations in the class of Stokes waves (Stokes bifurcation) and bifurcations in a class of periodic waves with the period M times the period of the Stokes wave (M-subharmonic bifurcation). If we consider the first Stokes bifurcation point then there are no M-subharmonic bifurcations before this point and there exists M-subharmonic bifurcation points after the first Stokes bifurcation for sufficiently large M, which approach the Stokes bifurcation point when M tends to infinity. Moreover the set of M- subharmonic bifurcating solutions is a closed connected continuum.",

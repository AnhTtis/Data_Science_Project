    "abstract": "A large number of fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected with the CHIME telescope enable us to investigate their energy distributions in different redshift intervals, incorporating with the consideration of the selection effects of CHIME. As a result, we obtain a non-evolving energy function (EF), which is in a power law form with a low-energy exponential cutoff, for the high-energy FRBs (HEFRBs) of energies $E\\gtrsim2\\times0^{38}$ erg. On the contrary, the energy distribution of the low-energy FRBs (LEFRBs) obviously cannot be described by the same EF. Including the lowest dispersion measures (DMs) samples, the LEFRBs are concentrated towards the Galactic plane and their latitude distribution is similar to that of Galactic rotational radio transients (RRATs). These indications hint that LEFRBs might compose a special type of RRATs with relatively higher DMs and energies (i.e., $\\sim10^{28-31}$ erg for a reference distance of $\\sim10$ kpc if they belong to the Milky Way). Finally, we revisit the redshift-dependent event rate of HEFRBs and confirm that they could be produced by the remnants of cosmological compact binary mergers.",

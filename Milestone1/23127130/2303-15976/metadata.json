    "abstract": "In 2013, Koldobsky posed the problem to find a constant $d_n$, depending only on the dimension $n$, such that for any origin-symmetric convex body $K\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$ there exists an $(n-1)$ dimensional linear subspace $H\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$ with\n  \\[\n  |K\\cap\\mathbb{Z}^n| \\leq d_n\\,|K\\cap H\\cap \\mathbb{Z}^n|\\,\\mathrm{vol}(K)^{\\frac 1n}.\n  \\] In this article we show that $d_n$ is bounded from above by $c\\,n^2\\,ω(n)$, where $c$ is an absolute constant and $ω(n)$ is the flatness constant. Due to the best known upper bound on $ω(n)$ this gives a ${c\\,n^{10/3}\\log(n)^a}$ bound on $d_n$ where $a$ is another absolute constant. This bound improves on former bounds which were exponential in the dimension.",

abstract = {Echo state network (ESTN) is a new recurrent neural networks (RNN) with a simpler training method. Based on ESTN, this paper address a state feedback control algorithm for a class of perturbed SISO nonlinear systems in the affine form. The control algorithm is implemented without aprior knowledge of the nonlinear system. The network weights can be tuned on line by the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) method without off line learning phase needed. The convergence and the Bounded Input Bounded Output (BIBO) stability of the ESTN controller are proven. Moreover, all signals involved in the closed loop are proven to be exponentially bounded and then the stability of the system. We have used the tracking problem of one-link rigid robotic manipulator system as an example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

abstract = {A robust model predictive control (RMPC) approach for linear systems with bounded state-dependent uncertainties is proposed. Such uncertainties can arise from unmodeled non-linearities or external disturbances, for example. By explicitly considering the state dependency of the uncertainty sets in the RMPC approach, it is shown how closed-loop performance can be improved over existing approaches that consider worst-case uncertainty. Being able to handle state-dependent uncertainties is particularly relevant in learning-based MPC where the system model is learned from data and confidence in the model typically varies over the state space. The efficacy of the proposed approach for learning-based RMPC is illustrated with a numerical example, where uncertainty sets are obtained from data using Gaussian Process regression.}

abstract = {Model predictive control requires the real-time solution of an optimal control problem, which can be challenging on computationally limited systems. Approximating the solution such as by neural networks or series expansions, or deriving an explicit solution, can overcome this challenge. Using neural networks for approximation, a question arises as to how to guarantee closed-loop safety and stability. We use robust control theoretic tools to provide stability guarantees using a neural network trained to approximate a model predictive controller. Notably, the model predictive controller, which might offer desirable closed-loop performance, is not required to provide provable stability properties. To provide stability guarantees for the neural network approximated controller, the closed-loop system is reformulated as a diagonal nonlinear differential form, exploiting that the neural network activation functions are sector bounded and that their slopes are globally bounded. Based on this representation, we establish sufficient closed-loop stability conditions in form of linear matrix inequalities for the nominal and the disturbed system using the neural network approximated model predictive controller.}

abstract = {Many systems exhibit multiple modes of operation, where the real mode is not known a priori. Examples are the grasping of objects by a robot, where a variety of object forms and stiffnesses are possible, or a quadcopter lifting and dropping several objects with different weights. In such cases it is challenging to design a controller that ensures robustness and safety for all possible modes without jeopardising performance. To this end, we present a learning supported predictive control approach for multi-mode uncertain environments with robustness guarantees. The approach allows to fuse a priori knowledge via including multiple models of the system with on-line and off-line learning to improve the system models and thus the overall performance. Guaranteed robustness is ensured by decoupling it from performance. While learned and improved models are used for performance optimization, robustness is guaranteed by ensuring that all possible modes respect the constraints and are repeatedly feasible. The ideas are confirmed considering an UAV package delivery example.}

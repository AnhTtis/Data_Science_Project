    "abstract": "Ruddlesden-Popper and reduced Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates are intriguing candidates for mimicking the properties of high-temperature superconducting cuprates. The degree of similarity between these nickelates and cuprates has been the subject of considerable debate. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has played an important role in exploring their electronic and magnetic excitations, but these efforts have been stymied by inconsistencies between different samples and the lack of publicly available data for detailed comparison. To address this issue, we present open RIXS data on La4Ni3O10 and La4Ni3O8.",

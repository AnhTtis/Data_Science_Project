    "abstract": "There is no doubt that the information hidden in quantum entanglement can be used to infer the organizing principle of various quantum phases of matter, ranging from spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, quantum critical points to topologically ordered states. It is far from clear, however, whether entanglement measures, such as the entanglement entropy (EE), can actually be obtained with the precision required to observe these subtle features -- usually in the form of universal finite size scaling behavior -- in highly entangled quantum matter. In the case of 2D interacting fermionic lattice models with gapless spectra, such as in the Hubbard model, the computation of the EE has faced severe limitations, making reliable data in the universal scaling regime off limits to all existing numerical algorithms. Here we explain the reason for the previously unsuccessful attempts in EE computations in quantum Monte Carlo simulations and more importantly, show how to overcome the conceptual and computational barrier with the incremental algorithm[1,2], such that the computation of the EE in 2D interacting fermion systems finally becomes easy and reliable.",

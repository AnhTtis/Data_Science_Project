In 2008, Kindratenko et al.~\cite{ki-uf-a} presented a first attempt for ERI calculation on FPGAs using the SRC MAP C compiler. The evaluation was limited to $[ss|ss]$ quartets, which forms the simplest, and due to its limited computational complexity also little promising point in the design space covered in this work. The main contribution of Kindratenko et al.~\cite{ki-uf-a} was to improve pipelining through the manual fusion of selected nested loops. A similar approach was presented for other kinds of two electron integrals used for studying electron scattering~\cite{gi-st-10a,gi-st-12a} using Mitrion-C. Loop fusion shows up in our work as attribute guided automatic loop coalescing in Sec.~\ref{paragraph:default:rrloops} and Sec.~\ref{paragraph:default:gqloops} after customization of parallelism.

In this work, we implement the first ERI computation and compression with arbitrary bitwidth integer on FPGAs. %
Targeting 256 ERI quartet classes up to $L=3$ with their diverse computation characteristics, high throughput is achieved via FPGA kernels that are customized at compile-time via function templates by using the Intel oneAPI DPC++ compiler.
The measured throughput is analyzed and accurately explained by a performance model.
Our evaluation shows that the FPGA kernels parallelized on 2 Stratix 10 GX 2800 outperform libint, an optimized library for ERI computation, by factors up to 6.0x on two-socket server with 40 Intel Xeon Gold 6148 CPU cores and up to 1.9x on 128 AMD EPYC 7713 CPU cores.
Meanwhile, up to 5x energy efficiency is reached for the benchmark computation compared to the newer CPUs.
The numerical errors are mainly due to the bitwidth used in ERI compression, regardless of single- or double-precision arithmetic operations used in ERI computation.

The ERI computation is a key component in hybrid-DFT based AIMD simulations. This work paves the way for FPGA-accelerated quantum-mechanics-based atomic simulations.
Further development in the direction of a suitable libint-like library interface allowing to use of the implementation in many quantum chemistry codes is already on the way.

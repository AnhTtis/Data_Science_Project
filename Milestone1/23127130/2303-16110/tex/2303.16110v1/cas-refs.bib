abstract = {In this paper, we further analyze, test, modify, and improve the high order WENO (weighted essentially non-oscillatory) finite difference schemes of Liu, Osher, and Chan. It was shown by Liuet al.that WENO schemes constructed from therth order (inL1norm) ENO schemes are (r+ 1)th order accurate. We propose a new way of measuring the smoothness of a numerical solution, emulating the idea of minimizing the total variation of the approximation, which results in a fifth-order WENO scheme for the caser= 3, instead of the fourth-order with the original smoothness measurement by Liuet al.This fifth-order WENO scheme is as fast as the fourth-order WENO scheme of Liuet al.and both schemes are about twice as fast as the fourth-order ENO schemes on vector supercomputers and as fast on serial and parallel computers. For Euler systems of gas dynamics, we suggest computing the weights from pressure and entropy instead of the characteristic values to simplify the costly characteristic procedure. The resulting WENO schemes are about twice as fast as the WENO schemes using the characteristic decompositions to compute weights and work well for problems which do not contain strong shocks or strong reflected waves. We also prove that, for conservation laws with smooth solutions, all WENO schemes are convergent. Many numerical tests, including the 1D steady state nozzle flow problem and 2D shock entropy wave interaction problem, are presented to demonstrate the remarkable capability of the WENO schemes, especially the WENO scheme using the new smoothness measurement in resolving complicated shock and flow structures. We have also applied Yang's artificial compression method to the WENO schemes to sharpen contact discontinuities.}

  abstract = 	 {Constructing fast numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) is crucial for many scientific disciplines. A leading technique for solving large-scale PDEs is using multigrid methods. At the core of a multigrid solver is the prolongation matrix, which relates between different scales of the problem. This matrix is strongly problem-dependent, and its optimal construction is critical to the efficiency of the solver. In practice, however, devising multigrid algorithms for new problems often poses formidable challenges. In this paper we propose a framework for learning multigrid solvers. Our method learns a (single) mapping from discretized PDEs to prolongation operators for a broad class of 2D diffusion problems. We train a neural network once for the entire class of PDEs, using an efficient and unsupervised loss function. Our tests demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to the widely used Black-Box multigrid scheme, suggesting that our method successfully learned rules for constructing prolongation matrices.}

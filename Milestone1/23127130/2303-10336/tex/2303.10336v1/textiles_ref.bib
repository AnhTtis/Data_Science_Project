    abstract = {The engineer who embarks upon the design of a feedback amplifier must be a creature of mixed emotions. On the one hand, he can rejoice in the improvements in the characteristics of the structure which feedback promises to secure him. On the other hand, he knows that unless he can finally adjust the phase and attenuation characteristics around the feedback loop so the amplifier will not spontaneously burst into uncontrollable singing, none of these advantages can actually be realized. The emotional situation is much like that of an impecunious young man who has impetuously invited the lady of his heart to see a play, unmindful, for the moment, of the limitations of the \$2.65 in his pockets. The rapturous comments of the girl on the way to the theater would be very pleasant if they were not shadowed by his private speculation about the cost of the tickets.}

The driving circuit is made as a module and scans the 128 switch elements which have two pressure thresholds in 1[ms]. The first pressure threshold is set to 25[gf/cm/sup 2/]. The other sensor is made of conductive gel which has remarkable softness. This conductive gel has the advantage of its softness compared with other sheet type tactile sensors. The impedance of the gel changes by approximately 20\% from 0 to 400 [gf/cm/sup 2/]. The tactile sensor consists of 8/spl times/8 sensing points on the intersection of the electrodes, and the processing module scans all the points in 30[ms]. We apply them to a wheeled humanoid robot referred to as "H4". The detail of the sensor system on the robot and some experiments on the robot using tactile information are shown.}

Depending on the skin electronics, it endows its carrier with an ability to sense its surroundings via the skin’s proximity, touch, pressure, temperature, chemical/biological, or other sensors. Sensitive skin devices will make possible the use of unsupervised machines operating in unstructured, unpredictable surroundings—among people, among many obstacles, outdoors on a crowded street, undersea, or on faraway planets. Sensitive skin will make machines “cautious” and thus friendly to their environment. This will allow us to build machine helpers for the disabled and elderly, bring sensing to human prosthetics, and widen the scale of machines’ use in service industry. With their ability to produce and process massive data flow, sensitive skin devices will make yet another advance in the information revolution. This paper surveys the state of the art and research issues that need to be resolved in order to make sensitive skin a reality. The paper is partially based on the report of the Sensitive Skin Workshop conducted jointly by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in October 1999 in Arlington, VA, of which the three co-authors were the co-chairs [1].}

The proposed surface cover sensor as the tactile interface enables robots to detect accurate 3D force vector applied on various parts of the body during physical interaction with humans. First, after analysis of a variety of contact situations between humans and robots, tactile and force information needed are specified, and the specifications are decided based on knowledge of human engineering. Next, a design method of a cover sensor that can detect accurate force vector and contact position is described. The cover sensor utilizes a force-torque sensor and is surrounded with several touch sensors. The mechanism was implemented on a humanoid robot, WENDY. Finally, evaluation experiments of locus tracking on the surface and force-following to humans were carried out. The experimental results demonstrate the high capabilities of the proposed cover sensor as human-robot interface, and indicate that the proposed design method of whole-body tactile interface is capable of enhancing human-robot coordination.}

The system is based on a textile wearable interface implemented by integrating sensors, electrodes, and connections in fabric form, advanced signal processing techniques, and modern telecommunication systems. Sensors, electrodes and connections are realized with conductive and piezoresistive yarns. The sensorized knitted fabric is produced in a one step process. The purpose of this paper is to show the feasibility of a system based on fabric sensing elements. The capability of this system to acquire simultaneously several biomedical signals (i.e. electrocardiogram, respiration, activity) has been investigated and compared with a standard monitoring system. Furthermore, the paper presents two different methodologies for the acquisition of the respiratory signal with textile sensors. Results show that the information contained in the signals obtained by the integrated systems is comparable with that obtained by standard sensors. The proposed system is designed to monitor individuals affected by cardiovascular diseases, in particular during the rehabilitation phase. The system can also help professional workers who are subject to considerable physical and psychological stress and/or environmental and professional health risks.}

	abstract = {A theoretical model for electro-mechanical properties of intrinsically conductive knitted fabrics made from stainless steel multi-filament yarns under large uniaxial deformation is presented. The investigations are focused on the relationship between the load and electrical resistance of the fabric under uniaxial extension. A circuit network is proposed based on the loops configuration and fabric structure. The equivalent resistance of the fabric is obtained by solving the circuit equations of the network. In order to simplify the calculation of the contacting forces on the overlapped yarns, a two-dimensional hexagon model is used to represent the loop configurations. An image-capturing system is employed to record the images of the loop configurations during the extension process and the relationship between the configurations of the loops and the load imposed on the fabric is obtained. From the theoretical analysis and experimental investigations, it is found that the contacting resistance of the overlapped yarns in the fabric is the key factor that governs the sensitivity of the fabric sensor. In addition, the fabric structure that determines the structure of the circuit network is also an important factor affecting the characteristics of the fabric sensor.}

Electro-mechanical properties, which governor the sensitivity of the gauge, are analyzed theoretically by a model of weft plain fabric. The contacting electrical resistance (Rc), resulted from two overlapped yarns, is attributed to be the key factor contributing to the resistance–strain response while the fabric structure determines the sensitivity of the gauge. Two structures are fabricated making use of the properties of contacting resistance to find the key factors governing the sensitivity, repeatability and accuracy of the sensors. The effects of strain-rate and temperature on the sensitivity of the gauge are analyzed experimentally. From the experimental results, fabric gauges made from carbon fibers display a higher sensitivity, repeatability and accuracy than those made by stainless steel due to its small internal friction and intrinsic physics properties. Meanwhile, tubular structure has high maximum strain level than single warp structure but exhibits lower sensitivity than the latter. Temperature exhibits greater effect on the sensitivity than the strain-rate.}

The hollow fiber structure is fabricated from commercially available silicone rubber tube by laminating a metal and an insulation layers on the surface. The fabricated hollow fiber is 250 mum in external diameter and 40 mum in thickness. The fabric tactile sensor is produced by weaving the hollow fibers like a cloth. Contact force on the sensor is detected by measuring the capacitance change at the intersection of two intersected fibers. The sensor detects the 2D contact-force distribution by sequentially scanning the capacitances at all fiber intersection points. The advantage of this novel fabric tactile sensor is that it can realize a genuine wearable sensor by directly weaving artificial fibers. In the present study, we fabricated artificial hollow fibers by thin-film deposition, and created a fabric tactile sensor by weaving the hollow fibers by hand. We confirmed the developed fabric tactile sensor can detect the contact force by measuring the capacitance change between the intersecting hollow fibers.}

	abstract = {Antennas constructed in part from conductive textile materials (also known as e-textiles) by means of standard textile manufacturing techniques are currently receiving increasing attention from antenna theorists and antenna manufacturers alike. However, due mostly to the unique fabrication methods employed, these novel materials cannot be treated as simple, equivalent substitutes for the more-conventional metallic antennas. Conductive yarns can have considerably less-than-ideal conductivity, and their inhomogeneous internal structure, with features small with respect to the skin depth, can be difficult to analyze directly in terms of conductive-material bulk resistivity. Furthermore, the undulating and sometimes non-planar nature of stitched or woven conductive textile yarns introduces a significant phase delay that must be properly taken into account. This article describes a method to determine the conductivity, sigma , which accurately represents a lossy inhomogeneous textile conductor for a MoM segment having the same radius as the actual conductive yarn. This method has three steps. First, the resistance per unit length of the textile conductor is determined experimentally, in a transmission-line test cell. Next, this measured resistance per unit length is adjusted to account for the nonuniform current distribution across the multiple yarn conductors. Finally, a surface-impedance formulation is employed to derive an equivalent MoM-segment bulk conductivity that accurately represents the measured conductor's performance. Excess phase delay, inherent in textile conductors, is determined by examination of the phase component of the test cell scattering parameter, S21.}

This paper proposes a novel tactile sensor made of flexible and stretchable silicone rubber. A structure of the sensor is similar to the capacitive tactile sensors. However, the proposed sensor utilizes a different principle from existing sensors. The sensor utilizes static electricity and electrostatic induction phenomenon, and can detect some touch conditions. This paper reports the principle and characteristics of the proposed sensor. Experiments show that the sensor output depends on touch area, touch velocity, and material of touch objects. However, the sensor does not depend on touch weight. Moreover, the experiment shows that even if the proposed sensor is stretched, it performs as the tactile sensor.}

In this paper, we concentrate on usability and applicability issues concerned with capacitive touch input on clothing. To be able to perform user studies, we built a generic platform for attaching, e.g., capacitive sensors of different types. On top of that, several prototypes of wearable accessories and clothing and implemented various application scenarios. We report on two studies we undertook with these implementations with a user group randomly sampled at a shopping mall. We provide a significant set of guidelines and lessons learned that emerged from our experiences and those studies. Thus, developers of similar projects have to put major efforts into minimizing the delay between button activation and feedback and to make location and identification of controls and their function as simple and quick as possible. Issues that have to be treated in all designs include the requirement of one-handed interaction and that, even for minimal functionality, to find a general solution with regard to layout and button-to-function mapping is hardly possible. Additionally, in order to generate a satisfactory user experience good usability must be combined with aesthetical factors.}

In this paper, we present a newly developed conductive structure which is pressure sensitive but stretch insensitive and is based on the concept of contact resistance between (1)a network of stretchable wave-like conductive yarns with high resistance and (2)a conductive stretchable sheet with low resistance. Based on this newly developed structure, we have realized a novel tactile distribution sensor which enables stable measurement under dynamic and large stretch from various directions. Stable measurement of pressure distribution under dynamic and complex deformation cases such as pinching and pushing on a balloon surface are demonstrated. The sensor has been originally designed for implementation over interactive robots with soft and highly deformable bodies, but can also be used as novel user interface devices, or ordinary pressure distribution sensors. Some of the most remarkable specifications of the developed tactile sensor are high stretchability up to 140\% and toughness under adverse load conditions. The sensor also has a realistic potential of becoming as thin and stretchable as stocking fabric. A goal of this research is to combine this thin sensor with stretch distribution sensors so that richer and more sophisticated tactile interactions can be realized.}

Electrodes built with conductive textiles are arranged on both sides of a compressible spacer, forming a variable capacitor. The use of textiles makes unobtrusive, comfortable, lightweight, and washable sensors possible. This simplifies the goal to integrate such sensors into clothing in the future, to be simple, and fast to mount just as getting dressed. Hysteresis induced by the spacer of the sensor has been modeled with the Preisach model to reduce the measurement error from 24\% to 5\% on average and the maximal error from above 50\% to below 10\%. Standard textiles that are not specially optimized for low hysteresis can be used for designing the sensor due to the modeling. The model may also be used for other pressure or even strain sensors to reduce their hysteresis. The modeling enhances the accuracy of the textile sensor to those of commercial, nontextile pressure sensing mats. Furthermore, we used the sensor system for the classification of sitting postures in a chair. The data of nine subjects have been classified with Naive Bayes classifier, achieving an average recognition rate of 82\%. We show that the textile sensor performs similarly to a commercial, nontextile pressure sensing mat for this application.}

A number of commercial conductive threads have been considered. Digital embroidery has been used to create samples with different stitch types. This paper will provide a wide range of practical advice about fabricating samples using such materials. The threads have been examined by assessing their DC resistances at rest and while under physical strain and also the RF performance of transmission lines. The results show there is a wide range in performance between different conductive threads.}

	abstract = {We have developed a slip sensor which is knitted by tension-sensitive electro-conductive yarns. When elongating this yarn, its resistance will drop remarkably. Because the yarn is mainly sensitive to deformation along its main axis, a special way to knit these yarns has been proposed to form a slip sensor. This sensor is used in detection of the human fingertip's slip during rubbing action on its surface. We found that, a simple derivative of the sensor's output was sufficient to detect slippage. However, in some cases, the sensor gets troublesome to distinguish between change of normal load and the occurrence of slip, since human implements their action without caring much about keeping the stable applied force on the sensor. Therefore, a well-known DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) method is employed to overcome this problem. As a result, depending on the purpose of the application, several data processing methods are employed to detect slippage of human's rubbing action, or robotic fingertip. Results in this paper promise an applicable sensory mean, which can be employed in haptic devices, teleoperation, or robotic skin.}

The resultant fibers were woven with automatic looming machines, forming meter-scale devices (1.2 m $\times$ 3 m). The fabricated sensor fabric was examined on the detection of human touch. Then, the sensor observed surface capacitance of about 0.5 pF by touching sensors with a human finger. Therefore, our sensor will lead to meter-scale touch sensors and input devices for various electronic devices.}

To accomplish this, we extend time domain reflectometry in three ways: (1) Thin: We demonstrate how to run time domain reflectometry on a single wire. This allows us to touch-enable thin metal objects, such as guitar strings. (2) Modularity: We present a two-pin connector system that allows users to daisy chain touch-sensitive segments. We illustrate these enhancements with 13 prototypes and a series of performance measurements. (3) Deformability: We create deformable touch devices by mounting stretch-able wire patterns onto elastic tape and meshes. We present selected performance measurements.}

	abstract = {Humans usually distinguish objects by sliding their fingertips on the surface to feel the texture via mechanoreceptor underneath the skin. We have developed a human-imitated system for robotic fingertip to sense object's texture via sliding action. Design of the sensory skin was inspired by the localized displacement phenomenon of a sliding soft fingertip ([1]) to capture stick-slip events on the contact surface that mainly represent texture characteristics. The soft skin is knitted by electro-conductive tension-sensitive yarns, then covered over a hemispherical fingertip. The pile-shaped surface of the fabric sensor enhances tangential traction detection ability of the sensor, even though the normal load is also sensible. Our aim is to exploit this sensor in applications regarding relative sliding between the touched object and the surface of the sensor, such as slip detection ([2]), and surface identification in this paper. In surface encoding, we have experimentally investigated ability of the fabric sensor in recognition touched objects via multiple machine learning algorithms, such as naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with input extracted from autoregressive models, and ANN with input extracted from Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), have been trained to distinguish three typical textures. As a result, we have found that the last method outperforms the remains with an average successful rate of 90\%.}

The current BioSleeve system can reliably decode as many as sixteen discrete hand gestures and estimate the continuous orientation of the forearm. The gestures are used in several modes: for supervisory point-to-goal commands, virtual joystick for teleoperation, and high degree-of-freedom (DOF) mimicked manipulation. We report results from three control applications: a manipulation robot, a small ground vehicle, and a 5-DOF hand.}

The strain sensing fabric was produced by using electronic flat-bed knitting technology; the base fabric was produced with elastomeric yarns in an interlock arrangement and a conductive yarn was embedded in this substrate to create a series of single loop structures. Experimental results show that there is a strong relationship between base fabric parameters and sensor properties.}

The sensor is woven with common weaving machines with a special manner and its material is a common low-cost conductive fiber that does not use special and costly materials, such as optical fiber. The sensor mechanism is supported by the textile structure; thus our sensor has durability for frictional force and scratch occurring sometime in daily context.

Detection is achieved through measuring changes in the resistance of a complex stitch, formed by an industrial coverstitch machine using an un-insulated conductive yarn, on the surface of the fabric. We evaluate self-intersecting folds which cause short-circuits in the sensor, creating a quasi-binary resistance response, and non-contact bends, which deform the stitch structure and result in a more linear response. Folds and bends created by human movement were measured on the dorsal and lateral knee of both a robotic mannequin and a human. Preliminary results are promising. Both dorsal and lateral stitches showed repeatable characteristics during testing on a mechanical mannequin and a human.}

The pile-shaped surface of the sensor enhances its ability to detect tangential traction, while also enabling it to sense a normal load. Our aim is to use this sensor in applications involving relative sliding between its surface and a touched object, such as contact recognition, slip detection, and surface identification through a sliding motion. We carefully analyzed the static and dynamic characteristics of this sensor while varying the load and stretching force to fully understand its response and determine its degree of flexibility and stretchability. We found that a discrete wavelet transformation may be used to indicate stick/slip states while the sensor is sliding over surfaces. This method was then used to detect slippage events acting on the sensor's surface, and to decode textures in a classification test using an artificial neural network. Because of its flexibility and sensitivity, this sensor can be used widely as a robotic skin in humanoid robots.}

A simple structure of embroidered potentiometer to create textile switches as an input device in a smart textile system was tested. Both one- and two-point sensing method were successfully demonstrated. A complete success rate on switching was observed. These simple but ingenious embroidered touch sensors showed the possibility of a soft, lightweight, flexible, freely foldable touchpad as a ubiquitous solution. It was also shown that these minimal fabrication technologies may be highly valued in the smart textile field thanks to their simplified interconnections, customizability and tailorability on double curvature surfaces.}

	abstract = {The integration of artificial skin into robotic systems has long been foreseen. For the last decades the introduction was always just a couple of years away. One of the possible reasons for the slow progress is the focus of the research efforts on high sensitivity and spatial resolution. The resulting tactile sensor prototypes are presented as laboratory prototypes with no or little chance to be successfully integrated into a robotic system. In order to enable the operation of an artificial skin on a robotic system in real-world applications the conflict of goals between high sensitivity and an overload-proof, collision tolerant, design needs to be solved. Within this paper we present a stretchable tactile surface sensor as a major functional component of an artificial skin setup that is able to unite the required sensitivity with the ability to withstand collisions. The results of first experiments regarding sensitivity and the ability of the DLR Artificial Skin setup to withstand high impact forces are presented.}

It summarizes the basic principles and approaches employed when building fabric sensors as well as the most commonly used materials and techniques used in electronic textiles. This paper shows that sensing functionality can be created by intrinsic and extrinsic modifications to textile substrates depending on the level of integration into the fabric platform. The current work demonstrates that fabric sensors can be tailored to measure force, pressure, chemicals, humidity and temperature variations. Materials, connectors, fabric circuits, interconnects, encapsulation and fabrication methods associated with fabric technologies prove to be customizable and versatile but less robust than their conventional electronics counterparts. The findings of this survey suggest that a complete smart fabric system is possible through the integration of the different types of textile based functional elements. This work intends to be a starting point for standardization of smart fabric sensing techniques and e-textile fabrication methods.}

With the elbow support, the correlation coefficient and the rooted-mean-square error in the degree of arc were 0.99 and 5.73 for complete bends. With the knitted shirt, in the same way, the coefficients and errors were 0.92 and 16.52 for complete bends and 0.71 and 7.30 for a daily action sequence. The range of motion of the subject's elbow was about 132°.

The input impedance is calculated by measuring the stub's reflection coefficient using a simple RF reflectometer circuit, operating at 900MHz. The input impedance of the stub is affected by the dielectric properties of the surrounding material, and changes in a predictable manner when touched.

Yet, their functionality may be further extended by exploiting their surface as energy-harvesting platform. Different state-of-the-art energy harvesters are suitable for compact integration onto a textile antenna. We demonstrate this by integrating a power management system, together with multiple diverse scavenging transducers and a storage module, on a well-chosen textile antenna topology. We provide guidelines to ensure that the additional hardware does not affect the textile antenna's performance. Simultaneous scavenging from different energy sources significantly increases the autonomy of a wearable system, in the meanwhile reducing battery size.}

Since the niche of technical textiles is rapidly expanding and is the main field of innovation and research in textile and apparel industry, embroidery is found in a variety of new functional applications due to the unique opportunity of creating three-dimensional light-weight structures and laying threads on the base material in all directions. As the field of smart textiles is vast per se and is associated with technical textiles and wearable technologies, the main applications of the embroidery may be described accordingly as ones for technical applications. In the sphere of medical textiles, embroidery is a relatively new technique, but is successfully used for wounddressing development and innovative solutions for tissue engineering due to the opportunity of creating three-dimensional structures from fine polymer materials. Another advantageous characteristic of goods developed by embroidery is dimensional stability of manufactured textile structures. Due to these particularities embroidery is used widely also for such technical applications as development of heating grids, shielding, conductive interconnections, intelligent textile sensors and interfaces etc. Moreover, a large variety of materials and threads can be used in prototyping by the technique, e.g., conductive threads, metal wires, laminated polymer and carbon fibers. One of the challenging sub-sectors of intelligent textiles and smart textiles for healthcare applications is the research and development of textile sensors for biometrics and measurement of physical parameters. Most of the mentioned biosensors are implemented by transferring the principles of conventional actuators to the textile structures.}

In this work, we present a robotic fabric with embedded actuation and sensing. Attaching the same robotic fabric to a soft body in different ways leads to unique motions and sensor modalities with many different applications for robotics. In one mode, the robotic fabric acts around the circumference of the body, and compression of the body is achieved. Attaching the robotic fabric in another way, along one surface of a body for example, bending is achieved. We use thread-like actuators and sensors to functionalize fabric via a standard textile manufacturing process (sewing). The actuated fabric presented herein yields a contractile force of 9.6N and changes in length by approximately 60 when unconstrained. The integrated strain sensor is evaluated and found to have an RMS error of 14.6\%, and qualitatively differentiates between the compressive and bending motions demonstrated.}

As humans and robots have curved body parts that move with respect to each other, the practical usage of traditional rigid tactile sensor arrays is limited. Rather, a flexible tactile skin is required. Our design allows for several tactile cells to be embedded in a single sensor patch. It can have an arbitrary perimeter and can cover free-form surfaces. In this article we discuss the construction of the sensor and evaluate its performance. Our flexible tactile sensor remains operational on top of soft padding such as a gel cushion, enabling the construction of a human-like soft tactile skin. The sensor allows pressure measurements to be read from a subtle less than 1¿kPa up to high pressures of more than 500¿kPa, which easily covers the common range for everyday human manual interactions. Due to a layered construction, the sensor is very robust and can withstand normal forces multiple magnitudes higher than what could be achieved by a human without sustaining damage.As an exciting application for the sensor, we describe the construction of a wearable tactile dataglove with 54 tactile cells and embedded data acquisition electronics. We also discuss the necessary implementation details to maintain long term sensor performance in the presence of moisture. A flexible and stretchable durable fabric-based tactile sensor capable of capturing typical human interaction forces was developed.We present elaborate measurement results of the sensor.A process of creating multiple sensor areas in a single fabric patch was developed.The measures against performance degradation due to moisture are presented.Using the developed technology, a tactile dataglove with 54 pressure sensitive regions was built.}

For each pattern, the simulation-based design was conducted to choose optimal dimensions for the highest touch sensitivity. The sensor performances were characterized as-fabricated and under deformation (e.g., bending and stretching). While the interdigitated touch sensors were easier to fabricate, the diamond-shaped ones showed higher touch sensitivity under as-fabricated, stretching or even bending conditions. For both types of sensors, the touch sensitivity remained nearly constant under stretching up to 15\%, but varied under bending. They also showed robust performances under cyclic loading and against oxidation.}

The knitted textiles exhibit strain sensing properties that were dependent upon the number of PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers used in knitting. The knitted textiles show sensitivity (as measured by the gauge factor) that increases with the number of PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers deployed. A highly stable sensor response was observed when four PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers were co-knitted with a commercial Spandex yarn. The knitted textile sensor can distinguish different magnitudes of applied strain with cyclically repeatable sensor responses at applied strains of up to 160\%. When used in conjunction with a commercial wireless transmitter, the knitted textile responded well to the magnitude of bending deformations, demonstrating potential for remote strain sensing applications. The feasibility of an all-polymeric knitted textile wearable strain sensor was demonstrated in a knee sleeve prototype with application in personal training and rehabilitation following injury.}

Such exercises involve coordinated motions of different body parts and are difficult to recognize with a single body worn motion sensors (like a step counter). Instead a network of sensors on different body parts would be needed, which is not always practicable. As an alternative we describe a cheap, simple textile pressure sensor matrix, that can be unobtrusively integrated into exercise mats to recognize and count such exercises. We evaluate the system on a set of 10 standard exercises. In an experiment with 7 subjects, each repeating each exercise 20 times, we achieve a user independent recognition rate of 82.5\% and a user independent counting accuracy of 89.9\%. The paper describes the sensor system, the recognition methods and the experimental results.}

It has recently been growing in popularity in wearable computing devices especially in the form of textile based tactile sensor. These sensors often target the detection of not only touch but also force applied. A significant problem arises here in differentiating inputs from an intended finger touch and just a bend of the sensor or other objects touching the sensor. In this work, we present our initial efforts to differentiate between a finger and an insulated object touch event on a custom textile based tactile sensor we developed before. Our experiments show that the two cases could be differentiated using the capacitance change of the neighboring cross-over points.}

The current concept is an advancement with respect to a previous design developed at our lab. Experience in the development of applications based on the old sensor, such as manipulation and safe HRI, helped determining the requirements. The new sensor is capable of operating in a self- and mutual-capacitive proximity mode and in a mutual-capacitive tactile mode. The issue of having a trade-off between spatial resolution and sensing range in proximity mode due to the capacitive measurement principle is addressed. A circuit is designed to dynamically select or join electrodes involved in the proximity measurements, a technique which at the same time allows the implementation of the spatial resolution in the tactile mode. Also, all signal processing is done on board of the prototype sensor module, thus complete modularity is achieved.}

In a first experiment we determined an upper bound for the number of different angles users can reliably grab into a piece of fabric on their forearm. Our results show that users can, without looking at it, reliably grab fabric on their forearm with an average accuracy between 30$^{\circ}$ and 45$^{\circ}$, which would provide up to six different menu options selectable with the initial pinch. In a second experiment, we show that our textile sensor, Grabrics, can detect fold angles at 45$^{\circ}$ spacing with up to 85\% accuracy. Our studies also found that user performance and workload are independent of the fabric types that were tested.}

In this task, it is required that robot would sense interactions with human by touching, as well as assess possibility of human approaching by proximity sensation. In addition, it is also essential to fabricate an interface so that human does not feel uncomfortable during physical interaction with robot. This paper presents an attempt on fabrication of sensing elements that can be utilized for construction of a soft interface (or a robotic skin). Each element is made from fabrics and soft materials that can sense both proximity and applied force from human's touch. In addition, each sensing element can sense the relative distance of conductive object (or human body) that is approaching the sensing element's surface, and the 2×2 contact force distribution when the object makes contact with the sensing element. By exploiting simultaneous measurement of capacitance, each fabric sensing element can smoothly switch the proximity mode and tactile mode based on position of the object. We also constructed a model that can predict variation of capacitance measurement of proximity and tactile modes during operation for further analysis. The methods and results presented in this paper can be extended to construct a larger scale of robotic skin for robot's body, and act as a platform for study human-robot interaction.}

We present a novel approach for scalable tactile data acquisition using compressed sensing. We first demonstrate that the tactile data is amenable to compressed sensing techniques. We then develop a solution for fast data sampling, compression, and reconstruction that is suited for tactile system hardware and has potential for reducing the wiring complexity. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our technique on simulated tactile sensor networks. Our evaluations show that compressed sensing, with a compression ratio of 3 to 1, can achieve higher signal acquisition accuracy than full data acquisition of noisy sensor data.}

Based on a pilot-study with amputees, we assessed the utility of our design in scenarios brought up by the amputees and we summarize our findings to establish future directions for research into using smart textiles for the sensory enhancement of prosthetic limbs.}

With these gestures, the user can control various smartwatch applications. Exploring the performance of the GestureSleeve approach, we conducted a user study with a running application as use case.

However, EMG is typically invasive or obtrusive, expensive and difficult to use for untrained users. A possible solution is textile-based surface EMG (sEMG) integrated into clothing and used as a wearable device. This is, however, challenging due to (i) uncertainties in the electrical properties of conductive threads used to construct electrodes, (ii) imprecise fabrication technologies (e.g., embroidery, sewing), and (iii) a lack of standardisation in the choice of design variables. This paper, for the first time, provides a design guide for such sensors by performing a thorough examination of the effect of design variables on sEMG quality. Electrical characterisation and sEMG measurements are performed, considering the effects of manufacturing imprecision. Results show that the imprecisions in digital embroidery lead to a trade-off between low electrode resistance and high consistency. An optimum set of variables for this trade-off is identified and tested with sEMG during a variable force isometric grip exercise with n=6 participants and compared with traditional gel-based electrodes. Results show that thread-based electrodes provide a similar level of sensitivity to force variation as gel-based electrodes with about 90% correlation with expected linear behaviour.}

The sensing properties such as sensing linearity, response and recovery times were studied in the range of ammonia gas concentrations from 15 to 100 ppm.

	abstract = {Automated on bed posture recognition is of major importance to physical rehabilitation exercises. This paper presents a pressure sensor array system to unobtrusively recognize on bed postures for patients recovering from illness, injury and surgery. In this paper, we propose to use limb clusters to recognize on bed postures instead of using the whole body pressure map since the shapes and positions of limbs represent the postures in nature. To measure the similarities of limb clusters, we propose to use a comprehensive distance metric considering both physical distance and pressure difference. In the recognition phase, a weighted limb based recognition method is applied. The experiments are conducted with 15 subjects ranging from various gender, age and weight. The experiments have demonstrated that our proposed system and method can achieve a 97.8\% recognition rate for typical on bed postures.}

He/she can input commands by selecting one of the wrinkles, and these wrinkles disappear after input operation. This sequence can be performed inconspicuously since the wrinkles provide tactile feedback in an eye-free input interface. The interface is naturally buried in natural wrinkles on clothes. We implemented a prototype of the proposed input interface and evaluated users' learning on it. The evaluation results confirmed that users can operate the proposed interface with more than 95\% accuracy and in approximately two seconds per input.}

Previous fabric-based or flexible touch sensors have generally required a large number of sensing electrodes positioned in a dense XY grid configuration and a multitude of wires. This paper investigates the design and manufacturing of a planar (two-dimensional, XY location) touch fabric sensor with only two electrodes (wires) to sense both planar touch and pressure, making it ideal for applications with limited space/complexity for wiring. The proposed knitted structure incorporates a supplementary method of sensing to detect human touch on the fabric surface, which offers advantages over previous methods of touch localization through an efficient use of wire connections and sensing materials. This structure is easily manufactured as a single component utilizing flatbed knitting techniques and electrically conductive yarns. The design requires no embedded electronics or solid components in the fabric, which allows the sensor to be flexible and resilient. This paper discusses the design, fabrication, sensing methods, and applications of the fabric sensor in robotics and human-machine interaction, smart garments, and wearables, as well as the highly transdisciplinary approach pursued in developing medical textiles and flexible embedded sensors.}

These bits can be read by swiping a commodity smartphone across the fabric, using its inbuilt magnetometer. Our results show that magnetized fabric retains its data even after washing, drying and ironing. Using a glove made of magnetized fabric, we can also perform six gestures in front of a smartphone, with a classification accuracy of 90.1\%. Finally, using magnetized thread, we create fashion accessories like necklaces, ties, wristbands and belts with data storage capabilities as well as enable authentication applications.}

Its application on textiles could allow a wide range of applications in the field of medicine, sports, etc. Obtaining a flexible, robust touchpad with good response and low cost is one of the objectives of this work. A textile touchpad based on a diamond pattern design using screen printing technology has been developed. This technology is widely used in the textile industry and therefore does not require heavy investments. The developed prototypes were analyzed using a particular controller for projected capacitive technologies (pro-cap), which is the most used in gesture detection. Two different designs were used to obtain the best configuration, obtaining a good result in both cases.}

A common application for wetness detection sensors is the detection of urine in absorbent products such as diapers. However, unlike water, salinized liquids like urine accelerate the process of chemical reaction of integrated conductors (especially when exposed to electrical current), limiting the lifespan of e-textile sensors. This paper explores an approach to extending the lifespan of conductive thread sensors by blending copper filament with silver threads, and a comparative bench test of the effect of adding copper on the functional lifespan of a wetness sensor when exposed to saline. We find that while the bi-metallic sensor is effective in lengthening the lifespan of the conductive traces, it is likely due to the increased metal content rather than selective reaction of one metal to preserve the other. We make suggestions for further optimizing sensors.}

This paper was inspired by the human finger wet-induced wrinkle, which is usually observed when one soaks in warm water for a period, and has been indicated as an efficient transformation for enhancement of gripping stability in a wet environment. We proposed a device which is an integration of actuation (pneumatic actuator) and sensing elements (strain gauges) inside a thin, multilayered substrate. Under pressurization, the morphology of the substrate surface (both geometrical and mechanical characteristics) change with appearance of wrinkles. Especially, by formation of wrinkles, this device can change its shape so that the posture of embedded sensing elements (strain gauges) can vary and generate different responses depending on external load conditions. As a result, this device can actively select its sensing functions depending on specific sensing tasks. First, we created a model to investigate the dynamic changes in a strain gauges' mechanical response under formation of wrinkles. Then, a prototype of this sensing device and its fabrication process were proposed to accomplish sensing tasks under vertical indentation and horizontal sliding action on its surface by using one type of strain gauge. This paper is an example of soft morphological control in tactile sensing, and is expected to open a new avenue to development of tactile sensing systems.}

In this work, we propose a method to adaptively select a basis for each compressed tactile signal to improve the overall signal reconstruction accuracy. A classifier is trained offline using a set of candidate bases and training signals. When each new compressed signal is acquired, the classifier identifies which basis to use in reconstructing the full tactile signal from the compressed one. We evaluate our method using data generated by our tactile skin simulation system. Our evaluations show that our adaptive basis selection method consistently outperforms approaches that use a single basis for signal reconstruction.}

We demonstrate that the swatches can perform gesture detection when under thin layers of cloth or when weatherproofed, providing a high level of versatility not present with other types of approaches. Additionally, using small convolutional neural networks, low-level gestures can be identified with a high level of accuracy using a small, inexpensive microcontroller, allowing for an intelligent fabric that reports only gestures of interest, rather than a simple sensor requiring constant surveillance from an external computing device. The resulting e-textile smart composite has applications in controlling wearable devices by providing a simple, eyes-free mechanism to input simple gestures.}

	abstract = {Over the last decades, there have been numerous efforts in wearable computing research to enable interactive textiles. Most work focus, however, on integrating sensors for planar touch gestures, and thus do not fully take advantage of the flexible, deformable and tangible material properties of textile. In this work, we introduce SmartSleeve, a deformable textile sensor, which can sense both surface and deformation gestures in real-time. It expands the gesture vocabulary with a range of expressive interaction techniques, and we explore new opportunities using advanced deformation gestures, such as, Twirl, Twist, Fold, Push and Stretch. We describe our sensor design, hardware implementation and its novel non-rigid connector architecture. We provide a detailed description of our hybrid gesture detection pipeline that uses learning-based algorithms and heuristics to enable real-time gesture detection and tracking. Its modular architecture allows us to derive new gestures through the combination with continuous properties like pressure, location, and direction. Finally, we report on the promising results from our evaluations which demonstrate real-time classification.}

A discipline's toolset is decisive in what material can be handled and what output can be produced as well as the skills needed to handle it. New tools presented here allow for new interactions with materials and make new routines accessible to the processes of electronic making and textile crafting, potentially being inclusive to new user groups in the respective fields. Here, traditional needlecraft tools are adapted to integrate electric engineering needs. Functionally, these tools augment processes of textile crafting with information about electric properties of the artifact in production. More broadly, they are a chance to reflect on the roles and cultural assumptions of the technologies, and indeed crafts, that these tools enable.}

Textiles can maintain their shape when placed under tension and can even be engineered with variable stretching ability. Conversely, 3D printing is a relatively new technology that can precisely produce functional, rigid objects with custom geometry. Combining 3D printing and textiles opens up new opportunities for rapidly creating rigid objects with embedded flexibility as well as soft materials imbued with additional functionality. In this paper, we introduce a suite of techniques for integrating 3D printing with textiles during the printing process, opening up a new design space that takes inspiration from both fields. We demonstrate how the malleability, stretchability and aesthetic qualities of textiles can enhance rigid printed objects, and how textiles can be augmented with functional properties enabled by 3D printing.}

The prototype with reduced package weight/volume provides an impressive energy density of 2.58 mWh g−1 or 3.6 mWh cm−3, high tensile strength of over 1000 MPa, and bearable pressure of over 100 MPa. The nanoporous thread electrodes are prepared by the activation of commercial carbon fibers to have three-orders of magnitude increase in the specific surface area and 86\% retention of the original strength. The novel device configuration woven by solid electrolyte-coated threads shows excellent flexibility and stability during repeated mechanical bending tests. A supercapacitor watchstrap is used to power a liquid crystal display as an example of load-bearing power sources with various form-factor designs for wearable electronics.}

	abstract = {Digital fabrication methods are reshaping design and manufacturing processes through the adoption of pre-production visualization and analysis tools, which help minimize waste of materials and time. Despite the increasingly widespread use of digital fabrication techniques, comparatively few of these advances have benefited the design and fabrication of textiles. The development of functional fabrics such as knitted touch sensors, antennas, capacitors, and other electronic textiles could benefit from the same advances in electrical network modeling that revolutionized the design of integrated circuits. In this paper, the efficacy of using current state-of-the-art digital fabrication tools over the more common trialand- error methods currently used in textile design is demonstrated. Gaps are then identified in the current state-of-the-art tools that must be resolved to further develop and streamline the rapidly growing field of smart textiles and devices, bringing textile production into the realm of 21st century manufacturing.}

We employ an electrical impedance tomography (EIT) technique to estimate changes of resistance distribution on the sensor caused by fingertip contact. To compensate for the rebound elasticity of the elastomer and achieve real-time continuous contact sensing, we apply a dynamic baseline update for EIT. The baseline updates are triggered by fingertip contact and movement detections. Further, we support unidirectional stretching sensing using a model-based approach which works separately with continuous contact sensing. We also provide a software toolkit for users to design and deploy personalized interfaces with customized sensors. Through a series of experiments and evaluations, we validate the performance of contact and stretching sensing. Through example applications, we show the variety of examples enabled by iSoft.}

This is achieved by using electric field tomography in concert with an electrically conductive material, which can be easily and cheaply added to objects and surfaces. We show that our technique is compatible with commonplace manufacturing methods, such as spray/brush coating, vacuum forming, and casting/molding enabling a wide range of possible uses and outputs. Our technique can also bring touch interactivity to rapidly fabricated objects, including those that are laser cut or 3D printed. Through a series of studies and illustrative example uses, we show that Electrick can enable new interactive opportunities on a diverse set of objects and surfaces that were previously static.}

However, existing textile-based sensing techniques rely on tight-fitting garments to obtain sufficient signal to noise, making it uncomfortable to wear and limiting the technology to niche applications like athletic performance monitoring. Our solution leverages functionalized fabric to measure the triboelectric charges induced by folding and compression of the textile itself, making it a more natural fit for everyday clothing. However, the large sensing surface of a functionalized textile also increases body-coupled noise and motion artifacts, and introduces new challenges in how we suppress noise to detect the weak triboelectric signal. We address these challenges using a combination of textile, electronics, and signal analysis-based innovations, and robustly sense joint motions by improving SNR and extracting highly discriminative features from the signal. Additionally, we demonstrate how the same sensor can be used to measure relative changes in skin moisture levels induced by sweating. Our design uses a simple-to-manufacture layered architecture that can be incorporated into any conventional, loosely worn textile. We show that the sensor has high performance in natural conditions by benchmarking the accuracy of sensing several kinematic metrics as well as sweat level. Additionally, we provide real-world performance evaluations across three application case studies including activity classification, perspiration measurements during exercise, and comfort level detection for HVAC systems.}

We demonstrate how the yarn can be used as a pressure sensor and discuss how specific issues, such as connecting the soft textile sensor with the rigid electronics can be solved. In addition, we present a platform-independent API that allows rapid prototyping. To show its versatility, we present applications developed with different textile manufacturing techniques, including hand sewing, machine sewing, and weaving. RESi is a novel technology, enabling textile pressure sensing to augment everyday objects with interactive capabilities.}

Here we introduce a novel alternative approach exploiting a new modality: posture classification using bespoke 'smart' trousers with integrated textile pressure sensors. Changes in posture translate to changes in pressure patterns across the surface of our clothing. We describe the construction of the textile pressure sensor and, using simple machine learning techniques on data gathered from 10 participants, demonstrate its ability to discriminate between 19 different basic posture types with high accuracy. This technology has the potential to support anonymous, unintrusive sensing of interest, attention and engagement in a wide variety of settings.}

This tactile sensing system is constructed by an integration of actuation (pneumatic actuator) and sensing elements (strain gauge) inside a thin, multi-layered substrate. Under pressurization, the morphology of the substrate surface changes with the appearances of wrinkle. As a result, this device can detect both static load under indentation and dynamic sliding action by using only a single type of sensing element (strain gauge). In this paper, we present a computational model for estimation of the wrinkle's morphology and prediction of output of embedded sensing elements. The shape of the wrinkle and the posture of the sensing element are evaluated by calculating the height of the wrinkle. The wrinkle's mechanical change is assessed by ascertaining the stiffness of the wrinkle under vertical indentation by a spherical indenter. The output voltages of the sensor are calculated by the proposed model and the experimental values have an error of less than 10\%, which validates the accuracy of the proposed model. We also pointed out the role of the wrinkle's morphology to the sensor's sensitivity, implying that this sensing system may select suitable sensitivity for specific sensation tasks. This work is expected to pave a way for assessing the role of morphological change to tactile sensation, and development of soft active tactile sensing systems.}

However, no study has assessed touching and pinching using the same input interface. One of the textile interfaces has an input interface using wrinkles on clothes, and we have evaluated the input for the same. We designed three touch input methods and one pinch input method. We implemented the input and the output device which use wrinkles and carried out four evaluations. The results indicated that the pinch input reached the highest accuracy of 98\% of four input methods after learning and achieved the accuracy of 95\% or more irrespective of postures and positions. The narrowing-down selection reached the fastest input time of 1.85 seconds of four methods after learning and achieved the quickest input when participants were stationary, while the double touch was the most rapid when walking. According to the result of the wrinkle recognition, users have a high accuracy of the identification of wrinkles of 89.4\% and recognize their shape in approximately 12 seconds.}

Based on the recognition of such touching patterns as stroking, patting, and hugging, we conducted a verification of the estimation of the user's emotions using extracted features, such as strength and duration. The results indicate that emotional arousal was reflected by the number and strength of the touches, while the emotional valence emerged through the factor related to the context of the interaction.

    abstract = {The recent surge in using wearable personalized devices has made it increasingly important to have flexible textile-based sensor alternatives that can be comfortably worn and can sense a wide range of body strains. Typically fabricated from rigid materials such as metals or semiconductors, conventional strain sensors can only withstand small strains and result in bulky, inflexible, and hard-to-wear devices. Textile strain sensors offer a new generation of devices that combine strain sensing functionality with wearability and high stretchability. In this review, we discuss recent exciting advances in the fabrication, performance enhancement, and applications of wearable textile strain sensors. We describe conventional and novel approaches to achieve textile strain sensors such as coating, conducting elastomeric fiber spinning, wrapping, coiling, coaxial fiber processing, and knitting. We also discuss how important performance parameters such as electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, sensitivity, sensing range, and stability are influenced by fabrication strategies to illustrate their effects on the sensing mechanism of textile sensors. We summarize the potential applications of textile sensors in structural health monitoring, wearable body movement measurements, data gloves, and entertainment. Finally, we present the challenges and opportunities that exist to date in order to provide meaningful guidelines and directions for future research.}

    abstract = {Fabric sensors have been introduced to enable flexible touch-based interaction. We advance the technical capabilities of a scalable and low-profile knitted capacitive touch sensing system by introducing methods to improve its touch localization accuracy. The sensor hardware design tends toward minimalism by using a single conductive yarn and two external connections located at each endpoint. Fewer connectors simplify the textile system integration, but this comes at the expense of reduced signal information output from the system. The electrical continuity of the sensing element, essential to the process of knitting, also increases the uncertainty of localizing touch. We propose using Bode analysis to measure changes in signal due to capacitive touch, as well as design a new algorithm, MSD, which retains the most significant aspects of the signal in terms of touch location identification. We do not classify location of touch, but focus on an invariant signal representation. To evaluate our methods, we introduce ELD, a distance metric to compute the similarity of pairs of key-presses, generalizable to computing distances of tensors of varying lengths. Our experiments show that the proposed sensing method results in high-fidelity signals. Furthermore, the sparse representation of key-presses produced by MSD significantly increases separability between different touch locations. Possible applications based on these sensors are also illustrated through prototypes and use case descriptions.}

Multi-layer fabric sensors that detect touch, proximity, electric field, pressure, and stretch are machine-sewn in a keyboard pattern on a stretchable substrate. The result is a fabric-based musical controller that combines both the discrete controls of a keyboard and various continuous controls from the embedded fabric sensors. This enables unique tactile experiences and new interactions both with physical and non-contact gestures: physical by pressing, pulling, stretching, and twisting the keys or the fabric and non-contact by hovering and waving towards/against the keyboard and an electromagnetic source. We have also developed additional fabric-based modular interfaces such as a ribbon-controller and trackpad, allowing performers to add more expressive and continuous controls. This paper will discuss implementation strategies for our system-on-textile, fabric-based sensor developments, as well as sensor-computer interfacing and musical mapping examples of this multi-modal and expressive fabric keyboard.}

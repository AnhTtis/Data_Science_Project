    "abstract": "We present photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of SN~2021bxu (ATLAS21dov), a low-luminosity, fast-evolving Type IIb supernova (SN). SN~2021bxu is unique, showing a large initial decline in brightness followed by a short plateau phase. With $M_r = -15.93 \\pm 0.16\\, \\mathrm{mag}$ during the plateau, it is at the lower end of the luminosity distribution of stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) and shows a distinct $\\sim$10 day plateau not caused by H- or He-recombination. SN~2021bxu shows line velocities which are at least $\\sim1500\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ slower than typical SE-SNe. It is photometrically and spectroscopically similar to Type IIb SNe during the photospheric phases of evolution, with similarities to Ca-rich IIb SNe. We find that the bolometric light curve is best described by a composite model of shock interaction between the ejecta and an envelope of extended material, combined with a typical SN~IIb powered by the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni. The best-fit parameters for SN~2021bxu include a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.029^{+0.004}_{-0.005}\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, an ejecta mass of $M_{\\mathrm{ej}} = 0.57^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, and an ejecta kinetic energy of $K_{\\mathrm{ej}} = 9.3^{+0.7}_{-0.6} \\times 10^{49}\\, \\mathrm{erg}$. From the fits to the properties of the extended material of Ca-rich IIb SNe we find a trend of decreasing envelope radius with increasing envelope mass. SN~2021bxu has $M_{\\mathrm{Ni}}$ on the low end compared to SE-SNe and Ca-rich SNe in the literature, demonstrating that SN~2021bxu-like events are rare explosions in extreme areas of parameter space. The progenitor of SN~2021bxu is likely a low mass He star with an extended envelope.",

	abstract = {Individual analysts typically publish recommendations several times per year on the handful of stocks they follow within their specialized fields. How should investors interpret this information? How can they factor in the past performance of individual analysts when assessing whether to invest long or short in a stock? This is a complicated problem to model quantitatively: There are thousands of individual analysts, each of whom follows only a small subset of the thousands of stocks available for investment. Overcoming this inherent sparsity naturally raises the question of how to learn an analyst{\textquoteright}s forecasting ability by integrating track-record information from all the stocks the analyst follows; in other words, inferring an analyst{\textquoteright}s ability on Stock X from track records on both Stock X and stocks other than X. The authors address this topic using a state-of-the-art computationally rapid Bayesian machine learning technique called independent Bayesian classifier combination (IBCC), which has been deployed in the physical and biological sciences. The authors argue that there are many similarities between the analyst forecasting problem and a very successful application of IBCC in astronomy, a study in which it dominates heuristic alternatives including simple or weighted averages and majority voting. The IBCC technique is ideally suited to this particularly sparse problem, enabling computationally efficient inference, dynamic tracking of analyst performance through time, and real-time online forecasting. The results suggest the IBCC technique holds promise in extracting information that can be deployed in active discretionary and quantitative investment management.TOPICS: Security analysis and valuation, big data/machine learning, equity portfolio management},

HRP applies modern mathematics (graph theory and machine-learning techniques) to build a diversified portfolio based on the information contained in the covariance matrix. However, unlike quadratic optimizers, HRP does not require the invertibility of the covariance matrix. In fact, HRP can compute a portfolio on an ill-degenerated or even a singular covariance matrix{\textemdash}an impossible feat for quadratic optimizers. Monte Carlo experiments show that HRP delivers lower out-ofsample variance than CLA, even though minimum variance is CLA{\textquoteright}s optimization objective. HRP also produces less risky portfolios out of sample compared to traditional risk parity methods.TOPICS: Statistical methods, portfolio construction},

	abstract="Capital market investment is a growing stream of the economic literature. It has been a prime concern of a large number of investors belonging to different clusters or income groups for two reasons mainly. First, the construction of a portfolio, which deals with the selection of the stocks. Second, the formulation of an appropriate investment strategy, which calls for minimizing the risk while maximization of the return, i.e., optimization of the constructed portfolio. Following the broad framework as suggested in the seminal work of Markowitz [1], this research attempts to address the issue of portfolio optimization based on risk and return parameters while dynamically allocating the weights to the constituent stocks. In the first part of this study, k-means clustering is applied to a heterogeneous sample of 53 number of stocks enlisted with the NSE during the year 2012--2017. The purpose is to classify the stocks in three categories (such as low stock price, medium stock price, and high stock price) based on their monthly closing return. In the second phase, this study focuses on finding out the distribution of weights among the stocks belonging to the portfolio by using the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method under the dynamic environment. Finally, this study attempts to validate the results by applying perception mapping. We have found eight stocks in the cluster of low stock price which is the sample studied in this research. We have observed that dynamic allocation of weights led to minimization of risk and the finding is validated through a perceptual map.",

	abstract = {Forecasting stock returns is an exacting prospect in the context of financial time series. This study proposes a unique decision-making model for day trading investments on the stock market. In this regard, the model was developed using a fusion approach of a classifier based on machine learning, with the support vector machine (SVM) method, and the mean-variance (MV) method for portfolio selection. The model's experimental evaluation was based on assets from the São Paulo Stock Exchange Index (Ibovespa). Monthly rolling windows were used to choose the best-performing parameter sets (the in-sample phase) and testing (the out-of-sample phase). The monthly windows were composed of daily rolling windows, with new training of the classifying algorithm and portfolio optimization. A total of 81 parameter arrangements were formulated. To compare the proposed model's performance, two other models were suggested: (i) SVM + 1/N, which maintained the process of classifying the trends of the assets that reached a certain target of gain and which invested equally in all assets that had positive signals in their classifications, and (ii) Random + MV, which also maintained the selection of those assets with a tendency to reach a certain target of gain, but where the selection was randomly defined. Then, the portfolio's composition was determined using the MV method. Together, the alternative models registered 36 parameter variations. In addition to these two models, the results were also compared with the Ibovespa's performance. The experiments were formulated using historical data for 3716 trading days for the out-of-sample analysis. Simulations were conducted without including transaction costs and also with the inclusion of a proportion of such costs. We specifically analyzed the effect of brokerage costs on buying and selling stocks on the Brazilian market. This study also evaluated the classifier's performance, portfolios’ cardinality, and models’ returns and risks. The proposed main model showed significant results, although demand for trading value can be a limiting factor for its implementation. Nonetheless, this study extends the theoretical application of machine learning and offers a potentially practical approach to anticipating stock prices.}

Recent studies show that investors would take these higher-order moments into consideration to make a profitable investment decision. Unfortunately, due to the difficulties in solving the multi-objective problem with higher-order moments, the literature on portfolio selection problem with higher-order moments is few. This paper proposes a new hybrid approach to solve the portfolio selection problem with skewness and kurtosis, which includes not only the multi-objective optimization but also the data-driven asset selection and return prediction, where the techniques of two-stage clustering, radial basis function neural network and genetic algorithm are employed. With the historical data from Shanghai stock exchange, we find that the out-of-sample performance of our model with higher-order moments is significantly better than that of traditional mean-variance model and verify the robustness of our hybrid algorithm.}

This is the coherent Bayesian way of combining multiple models only under certain restrictive assumptions, which we outline. We explore a general framework for Bayesian model combination (which differs from model averaging) in the context of classification. This framework explicitly models the relationship between each model’s output and the unknown true label. The framework does not require that the models be probabilistic (they can even be human assessors), that they share prior information or receive the same training data, or that they be independent in their errors. Finally, the Bayesian combiner does not need to believe any of the models is in fact correct.  We test several variants of this classifier combination procedure starting from a classic statistical model proposed by Dawid and Skene (1979) and using MCMC to add more complex but important features to the model. Comparisons on several data sets to simpler methods like majority voting show that the Bayesian methods not only perform well but result in interpretable diagnostics on the data points and the models.}

In particular, we focus on scenarios where we have to be able to classify large quantities of data quickly. We investigate various methods for performing multi-modal fusion and analyze their trade-offs in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that the inclusion of continuous information improves performance over text-only on a range of multi-modal classification tasks, even with simple fusion methods. In addition, we experiment with discretizing the continuous features in order to speed up and simplify the fusion process even further.

In this study, we develop stock return prediction models that can jointly consider international markets, using multimodal deep learning. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we visualize the transfer information between South Korea and US stock markets by using scatter plots; (2) we incorporate the information into the stock prediction models with the help of multimodal deep learning; (3) we conclusively demonstrate that the early and intermediate fusion models achieve a significant performance boost in comparison with the late fusion and single modality models. Our study indicates that jointly considering international stock markets can improve the prediction accuracy and deep neural networks are highly effective for such tasks.},

	abstract = {Classification and identification of the materials lying over or beneath the earth's surface have long been a fundamental but challenging research topic in geoscience and remote sensing (RS), and have garnered a growing concern owing to the recent advancements of deep learning techniques. Although deep networks have been successfully applied in single-modality-dominated classification tasks, yet their performance inevitably meets the bottleneck in complex scenes that need to be finely classified, due to the limitation of information diversity. In this work, we provide a baseline solution to the aforementioned difficulty by developing a general multimodal deep learning (MDL) framework. In particular, we also investigate a special case of multi-modality learning (MML) - cross-modality learning (CML) that exists widely in RS image classification applications. By focusing on 'what,' 'where,' and 'how' to fuse, we show different fusion strategies as well as how to train deep networks and build the network architecture. Specifically, five fusion architectures are introduced and developed, further being unified in our MDL framework. More significantly, our framework is not only limited to pixel-wise classification tasks but also applicable to spatial information modeling with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the MDL framework, extensive experiments related to the settings of MML and CML are conducted on two different multimodal RS data sets. Furthermore, the codes and data sets will be available at https://github.com/danfenghong/IEEE_TGRS_MDL-RS, contributing to the RS community.},

In terms of historical data, we choose eight features, including opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, volume, turnover, ups and downs, and change. Firstly, we adopt CNN to efficiently extract features from the data, which are the items of the previous 10 days. And then, we adopt LSTM to predict the stock price with the extracted feature data. According to the experimental results, the CNN-LSTM can provide a reliable stock price forecasting with the highest prediction accuracy.

@report{graphical_model,
	abstract = {It is impossible to analyze an asset taken in isolation, without taking into account the wider picture of the market. This fact is behind the extensive use of copulas or vector autoregressive models in finance, which allow to model dependencies between assets. In this paper, we look at the graph-based method to model inter-asset behavior. Graphs are ubiquitous when representing relationships, whether to model social network interactions, disease spread, traffic, or supply chain information. It allows for a very intuitive representation of market interconnections. We show how several types of market information can be translated into graphs and show some graph-based tools for market analysis. Furthermore, neural convolution layers have been developed which allow for more expressive neural models. Just like Euclidean convolution layers on images, they promise to contextualise each individual asset during prediction. We show the effect of three graph neural layers on the stock return forecasting problem. Using these forecasts, we build portfolios and show that graph layers act as a stabilizer to classical methods like LSTM, reducing transaction costs and filtering out high-frequency signals. We also study the effect of different graph-based information on the forecast and observe that in 2021, supply chain information becomes much more informative than sectoral or correlation-based graphs.

	abstract = {To a large extent, electricity price prediction is a daunting task because it depends on factors, such as weather, fuel, load and bidding strategies etc. Those features generate a lot of fluctuations to electricity price. As a type of RNN, LSTM has a good performance on processing time series data as well as some nonlinear and complex problems. To explore more accurate electricity price forecasting approach, in this paper, a new hybrid model based on wavelet transform and Adam optimized LSTM neural network, denoted as WT-Adam-LSTM, is proposed. After the wavelet transform, nonlinear sequence of electricity price can be decomposed and processed data will have a more stable variance, and the combination of Adam, one of efficient stochastic gradient-based optimizers, and LSTM can capture appropriate behaviors precisely for electricity price. This study presented four cases to verify the performance of the hybrid model, and the dataset from New South Wales of Australia and French were adopted to illustrate the excellence of the hybrid model. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Stock market prediction is a very important problem in the economics field. With the development of machine learning, more and more algorithms are applied in the stock market to predict the stock price movement. However, stock market prediction is regarded as a challenging task for the noise and volatility of stock market data. Therefore, in this paper, a novel hybrid model SA-DLSTM is proposed to predict stock market and simulation trading by combine a emotion enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN), the denoising autoencoder (DAE) models, and long short-term memory model (LSTM). Firstly, user-generated comments on Internet were used as a complement to stock market data, and ECNN was applied to extract the sentiment representation. Secondly, we extract the key features of stock market data by DAE, which can improve the prediction accuracy. Thirdly, we take the timeliness of emotion on stock market into consideration and construct more reliable and realistic sentiment indexes. Finally, the key features of stock data and sentiment indexes are fed into LSTM to make stock market prediction. Experiment results show that the prediction accuracy of SA-DLSTM are superior to other compared models. Meanwhile, SA-DLSTM has a good performance both in return and risk. It can help investors make wise decisions.},

	abstract = {This paper finds evidence of return predictability across economically linked firms. We test the hypothesis that in the presence of investors subject to attention constraints , stock prices do not promptly incorporate news about economically related firms, generating return predictability across assets. Using a data set of firms' principal customers to identify a set of economically related firms, we show that stock prices do not incorporate news involving related firms, generating predictable subsequent price moves. A long-short equity strategy based on this effect yields monthly alphas of over 150 basis points. FIRMS DO NOT EXIST AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES, but are linked to each other through many types of relationships. Some of these links are clear and contractual, while others are implicit and less transparent. We use the former of these, clear economic links, as an instrument to test investor inattention. Specifically, we focus on well-defined customer-supplier links between firms. In these cases, partner firms are stakeholders in each others' operations. Thus, any shock to one firm has a resulting effect on its linked partner. We examine how shocks to one firm translate into shocks to the linked firm in both real quantities (i.e., profits) and stock prices.

The proposed model combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) on graphs to identify spatial structures and RNN to find dynamic patterns. We study two possible architectures of GCRN, and apply the models to two practical problems: predicting moving MNIST data, and modeling natural language with the Penn Treebank dataset.

	abstract = {Dynamic link prediction is a research hot in complex networks area, especially for its wide applications in biology, social network, economy and industry. Compared with static link prediction, dynamic one is much more difficult since network structure evolves over time. Currently most researches focus on static link prediction which cannot achieve expected performance in dynamic network. Aiming at low AUC, high Error Rate, add/remove link prediction difficulty, we propose GC-LSTM, a Graph Convolution Network (GC) embedded Long Short Term Memory network (LTSM), for end-to-end dynamic link prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that GCN embedded LSTM is put forward for link prediction of dynamic networks. GCN in this new deep model is capable of node structure learning of network snapshot for each time slide, while LSTM is responsible for temporal feature learning for network snapshot. Besides, current dynamic link prediction method can only handle removed links, GC-LSTM can predict both added or removed link at the same time. Extensive experiments are carried out to testify its performance in aspects of prediction accuracy, Error Rate, add/remove link prediction and key link prediction. The results prove that GC-LSTM outperforms current state-of-art method.},

Stock market prediction is a major challenge owing to non-stationary, blaring, and chaotic data, and thus, the prediction becomes challenging among the investors to invest the money for making profits. Several techniques are devised in the existing techniques to predict the stock market trends. This work presents the detailed review of 50 research papers suggesting the methodologies, like Bayesian model, Fuzzy classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, Neural Network (NN), Machine Learning Methods and so on, based on stock market prediction. The obtained papers are classified based on different prediction and clustering techniques. The research gaps and the challenges faced by the existing techniques are listed and elaborated, which help the researchers to upgrade the future works. The works are analyzed using certain datasets, software tools, performance evaluation measures, prediction techniques utilized, and performance attained by different techniques. The commonly used technique for attaining effective stock market prediction is ANN and the fuzzy-based technique. Even though a lot of research efforts, the current stock market prediction technique still have many limits. From this survey, it can be concluded that the stock market prediction is a very complex task, and different factors should be considered for predicting the future of the market more accurately and efficiently.}

abstract = {Precise prediction of stock prices leads to more profits and more effective risk prevention, which is of great significance to both investors and regulators. Recent years, various kinds of information not directly-relevant with stock prices have received more attention, such as texts, images or connections. These external information has the potential of reflecting or influencing fluctuations, and thus, given the utilization of advanced analyzing techniques, the forecasting performance of stock prices could be promoted substantially. For instance, graph neural network models have expanded into many other disciplines including stock price prediction, and exhibited impressive representation learning ability. However, in stock markets, well-defined graphs are rarely seen and how to formulate the graph structures needed remains a challenging problem. Towards this end, this article presents a comprehensive overview of graph construction and graph learning in stock price prediction, by reviewing the existing studies, summarizing its general paradigm, special cases and proposing possible prospects. Our research not only systematically reveals the feasible ways of constructing graphs in financial markets, but also provides insights for further implementations of graph learning models into stock prediction tasks.}

Most stock prediction methods study the historical sequence patterns to predict stock trend or price in the near future. In fact, the future price of a stock is correlated not only with its historical price, but also with other stocks. In this article, we take into account the relationships between stocks (corporations) by stock relation graph. Furthermore, we propose a Time-aware Relational Attention Network (TRAN) for graph-based stock recommendation according to return ratio ranking. In TRAN, the time-aware relational attention mechanism is designed to capture time-varying correlation strengths between stocks by the interaction of historical sequences and stock description documents. With the dynamic strengths, the nodes of the stock relation graph aggregate the features of neighbor stock nodes by graph convolution operation. For a given group of stocks, the proposed TRAN model can output the ranking results of stocks according to their return ratios. The experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our TRAN for stock recommendation.},

abstract = {In some stock markets, stock prices are not allowed to rise above a daily limit to restrain the surge of price (called price limit). When the price limit occurs, investors tend to chase the continuing upward momentum for profit-making. However, For the stocks that hit daily price limit, we observe whether they close at daily price limit will lead to the opposite price trends of the next trading day. Therefore, this work aims to predict whether a stock that hits its daily price limit will also close at the same price level (i.e., Type I or Type II). The occurrence of price limit is driven by different levels of market state. For example, it can result from macro-economic changes of the whole market, or it can be traced to some industry-specific factors. A challenging task is to learn a better stock representation with less uncertainty by comprehensively considering the hierarchical property of market state. Accordingly, we design a novel hierarchical architecture, called Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN), to investigate the market state at hierarchical view for stock type prediction. In HGNN, we construct the stock relation graph and merge stock information hierarchically extracted from multiple views of market state, including node view, relation view and graph view, which takes both historical sequence pattern and stock relation into consideration. Our key innovation is the introduction of hierarchical structure makes the predictive model able to more comprehensively infer the hierarchical property of market state. Further, it also provides the deeper insight for the actual investment practice. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct back-testing on the two-year historical data of more than 2500 main-board stocks in two China stock markets, SSE and SZSE. To support further study of the stock type prediction task, we have published two long-range stock datasets (Datasets are available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TXiAyqt3rHveuzdGT6YtswU1e-tBSFUe/view?usp=sharing). Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions including ALSTM, GCN and GAT with the improvements of at least 3.54% on average in accuracy. In addition, the average return ratio of SSE and SZSE has improved by 18.57% and 8.75%, respectively.}

Only few studies predicted the trend of one firm in terms of its relevant firms. A common strategy of the pilot work is to adopt graph convolution networks (GCNs) with some predefined firm relations. However, momentum spillovers are propagated via a variety of firm relations, of which the bridging importance varies with time. Restricting to several predefined relations inevitably makes noise and thus misleads stock predictions. In addition, traditional GCNs transfer and aggregate the peer influences without considering the states of both connected firms once a connection is built. Such non-attribute sensibility makes traditional GCNs inappropriate to deal with the attribute-sensitive momentum spillovers of listed firms wherein the abnormal price drop of one firm may not spill over if the trade volume of this decreasing price is small or the prices of the linked firms are undervalued. In this study, we propose an attribute-driven graph attention network (AD-GAT) to address both problems in modeling momentum spillovers. This is achieved by element-wisely multiplying the nonlinear transformation of the attributes of the connected firms with the attributes of the source firm to consider its attribute-sensitive momentum spillovers, and applying the unmasked attention mechanism to infer the general dynamic firm relation from observed market signals fused by a novel tensor-based feature extractor. Experiments on the three-year data of the S&amp;P 500 demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over stateof-the-art algorithms, including GCN, eLSTM, and TGC.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Cheng, Rui and Li, Qing}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={55-62} }

Here, in this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for BI applications. Specifically, we apply structural support vector machines (SSVMs) to perform classification on complex inputs such as the nodes of a graph structure. We connect collaborating companies in the information technology sector in a graph structure and use an SSVM to predict positive or negative movement in their stock prices. The complexity of the SSVM cutting plane optimization problem is determined by the complexity of the separation oracle. It is shown that (i) the separation oracle performs a task equivalent to maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference and (ii) a minimum graph cutting algorithm can solve this problem in the stock price case in polynomial time. Experimental results show the practicability of our proposed machine learning approach in predicting stock prices.},

abstract = {Stock market prices keep on varying day by day. It is very difficult to foresee the future value of the market by the sellers and buyers. In this paper, an analysis system which helps the people to identify the more profitable companies using data mining approaches is proposed. The clustering and regression are the two techniques of data mining used here, Validation index is used for analysing the performance of different clustering methods such as partitioning technique, hierarchical technique, model based technique and density based technique. Among the different clustering techniques experimented, partitioning technique and model based technique give high performance i.e.K-means and EM clustering algorithm respectively. For prediction of future stock price multiple regression technique is used which helps the buyers and sellers to choose their companies from stock.}

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

This architecture allows combining the textual sentiment from financial news and multiple relational information extracted from other types of financial data.

abstract = {Abstract The shocks on certain market spread to other markets due to the financial linkages of global economy, which is known as volatility spillover effect. In this study, we propose a volatility forecasting model for global market indices using the spatial-temporal graph neural network (GNN). The volatility spillover between markets are reflected in the model by estimating the linkage between markets, which is the input of GNN, using the volatility spillover index. An empirical analysis is conducted on eight representative global market indices. From the out-of-sample results, we found the following features. First, the proposed spatial-temporal GNN spillover model outperforms the benchmark models in short- and mid-term forecasting. Second, the forecasting accuracy highly depends on the inclusion of the market index with a high volatility spillover effect. Including S\&P500, which contains the highest net spillover index, effectively helps to forecast the volatilities of other markets. Third, the investor can gain economic gain by using predicted volatility from proposed model in the mean-variance framework.}

abstract = {Abstract The stock market is a capitalistic haven where the issued shares are transferred, traded, and circulated. It bases stock prices on the issue market, however, the structure and trading activities of the stock market are much more complicated than the issue market itself. Therefore, making an accurate prediction becomes an intricate as well as highly difficult task. On the other hand, because of the potential benefits of stock prediction, it attracts generation after generation of scholars as well as investors to continuously develop various prediction methods from different perspectives, a myriad of theories, a multitude of investment strategies, and different practical experiences. In this article, aiming at the task of time series (financial) feature extraction and prediction of price movements, a new convolutional novel neural network that can be called a framework to improve the prediction accuracy of stock trading is proposed. The method that is proposed is called SSACNN, a short form of stock sequence array convolutional neural network. SSACNN collects data including historical data of prices and its leading indicators (options/futures) for a stock to take an array as the input graph of the convolutional neural network framework. In our experimental results, five Taiwanese and American stocks were used as a benchmark to compare with the previous algorithms and proposed algorithm, the motion prediction performance of SSACNN has been improved significantly and proved that it has the potential to be applied in the real financial market.},

The new forecast method effectively handles the strong long memory serial dependence feature of the daily VXN by the ensemble CNN-BiLSTM together with proper normalization and batch size. The long memory features arising from time-dependent mean and variance are largely reduced by normalizing the data with local mean and local standard deviation (SD). The batch size is determined by the optimal block length of the moving block bootstrap which reflects the long memory. The ensemble CNN-BiLSTM concentrates on 1-day, 1-week, and 2-week features of the normalized VXN data. An out-of-sample forecast comparison reveals that (i) the proposed ensemble CNN-BiLSTM has better forecast performance than the autoregressive model, DNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and individual CNN-BiLSTMs; (ii) the local mean-SD normalization has superior forecast performance to the standard global mean-SD normalization; (iii) and the optimal block length improves the forecast performance over a batch size considered in the literature.},

abstract = {Abstract The existing contradictory findings on the contribution of trading volume to volatility forecasting prompt us to seek new solutions to test the sequential information arrival hypothesis (SIAH). Departing from other empirical analyses that mainly focus on sophisticated testing methods, this research offers new insights into the volume-volatility nexus by decomposing and reconstructing the trading activity into short-run components that typically represent irregular information flow and long-run components that denote extreme information flow in the stock market. We are the first to attempt at incorporating an improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method to investigate the volatility forecasting ability of trading volume along with the Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model. Previous trading volume is used to obtain the decompositions to forecast the future volatility to ensure an ex ante forecast, and both the decomposition and forecasting processes are carried out by the rolling window scheme. Rather than trading volume by itself, the results show that the reconstructed components are also able to significantly improve out-of-sample realized volatility (RV) forecasts. This finding is robust both in one-step ahead and multiple-step ahead forecasting horizons under different estimation windows. We thus fill the gap in studies by (1) extending the literature on the volume-volatility linkage to EMD-HAR analysis and (2) providing a clear view on how trading volume helps improve RV forecasting accuracy.},

This paper uses the text comment information of stockholders to construct a text sentiment factor that integrates the influence of comments and then combines other transaction information on volatility forecasting based on high-frequency finance data with the deep learning model long short-term memory (LSTM). The study finds that under the framework of the LSTM model, the forecasting accuracy for the volatility with the sentiment index is better than that of the LSTM model without the sentiment index and 10 traditional econometric models under the six loss functions. When compared with the traditional econometric model for multistep forecasting, the LSTM model is robust. With the addition of the public opinion index, the accuracy of LSTM is improved by 9.3\%, 4.7\%, 6.2\%, 9.2\%, 7.9\%, and 16.9\%, respectively, under the six evaluation criteria.

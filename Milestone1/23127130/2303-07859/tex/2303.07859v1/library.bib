In this paper we derive, using$\backslash$nfield-theoretic methods, a theory which becomes exact in the opposite$\backslash$nlimit of strong coupling. Formally, it corresponds to a standard$\backslash$nvirial expansion. Long-range divergences, which render the virial$\backslash$nexpansion intractable for homogeneous bulk systems, are shown to$\backslash$nbe renormalizable for the case of inhomogeneous distribution functions$\backslash$nby a systematic expansion in powers of the fugacity. For a planar$\backslash$ncharged wall, our analytical results compare quantitatively with$\backslash$nextensive Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {For some decades now, nanotechnology has been touted as the 'next big thing' with potential impact comparable to the steam, electricity or Internet revolutions-but has it lived up to these expectations? While advances in top-down nanolithography, now reaching 10-nm resolution, have resulted in devices that are rapidly approaching mass production, attempts to produce nanoscale devices using bottom-up approaches have met with only limited success. We have been inundated with nanoparticles of almost any shape, material and composition, but their societal impact has been far from revolutionary, with growing concerns over their toxicity. Despite nebulous hopes that making hierarchical nanomaterials will lead to new, emergent properties, no breakthrough applications seem imminent. In this Perspective, we argue that the time is ripe to look beyond individual nano-objects and their static assemblies, and instead focus on systems comprising different types of 'nanoparts' interacting and/or communicating with one another to perform desired functions. Such systems are interesting for a variety of reasons: they can act autonomously without external electrical or optical connections, can be dynamic and reconfigurable, and can act as 'nanomachines' by directing the flow of mass, energy or information. In thinking how this systems nanoscience approach could be implemented to design useful-as opposed to toy-model-nanosystems, our choice of applications and our nanoengineering should be inspired by living matter.},

abstract = {In bionanotechnology, the field of creating functional materials consisting of bio-inspired molecules, the function and shape of a nanostructure only appear through the assembly of many small molecules together. The large number of building blocks required to define a nanostructure combined with the many degrees of freedom in packing small molecules has long precluded molecular simulations, but recent advances in computational hardware as well as software have made classical simulations available to this strongly expanding field. Here, we review the state of the art in simulations of self-assembling bio-inspired supramolecular systems. We will first discuss progress in force fields, simulation protocols and enhanced sampling techniques using recent examples. Secondly, we will focus on efforts to enable the comparison of experimentally accessible observables and computational results. Experimental quantities that can be measured by microscopy, spectroscopy and scattering can be linked to simulation output either directly or indirectly, via quantum mechanical or semi-empirical techniques. Overall, we aim to provide an overview of the various computational approaches to understand not only the molecular architecture of nanostructures, but also the mechanism of their formation.},

abstract = {Controlling nucleation and growth is crucial in biological and artificial mineralization and self-assembly processes. The nucleation barrier is determined by the chemistry of the interfaces at which crystallization occurs and local supersaturation. Although chemically tailored substrates and lattice mismatches are routinely used to modify energy landscape at the substrate/nucleus interface and thereby steer heterogeneous nucleation, strategies to combine this with control over local supersaturations have remained virtually unexplored. Here we demonstrate simultaneous control over both parameters to direct the positioning and growth direction of mineralizing compounds on preselected polymorphic substrates. We exploit the polymorphic nature of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) to locally manipulate the carbonate concentration and lattice mismatch between the nucleus and substrate, such that barium carbonate (BaCO 3 ) and strontium carbonate (SrCO 3 ) nucleate only on specific CaCO 3 polymorphs. Based on this approach we position different materials and shapes on predetermined CaCO 3 polymorphs in sequential steps, and guide the growth direction using locally created supersaturations. These results shed light on nature's remarkable mineralization capabilities and outline fabrication strategies for advanced materials, such as ceramics photonic structures and semiconductors.},

abstract = {The field of supramolecular chemistry focuses on the non-covalent interactions between molecules that give rise to molecular recognition and self-assembly processes. Since most non-covalent interactions are relatively weak and form and break without significant activation barriers, many supramolecular systems are under thermodynamic control. Hence, traditionally, supramolecular chemistry has focused predominantly on systems at equilibrium. However, more recently, self-assembly processes that are governed by kinetics, where the outcome of the assembly process is dictated by the assembly pathway rather than the free energy of the final assembled state, are becoming topical. Within the kinetic regime it is possible to distinguish between systems that reside in a kinetic trap and systems that are far from equilibrium and require a continuous supply of energy to maintain a stationary state. In particular, the latter systems have vast functional potential, as they allow, in principle, for more elaborate structural and functional diversity of self-assembled systems-indeed, life is a prime example of a far-from-equilibrium system. In this Review, we compare the different thermodynamic regimes using some selected examples and discuss some of the challenges that need to be addressed when developing new functional supramolecular systems.},

The self-assembly of biological molecules, a ubiquitous process in nature, typically involves a complex interplay of physical interactions that can prove extremely challenging to investigate with traditional experimental techniques alone. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that computer simulation can be uniquely useful as an additional methodology that can guide and interpret experimental results, predict a range of inaccessible properties, and inform and inspire new lines of experimental investigation. This review specifically focuses on the application of the molecular dynamics method to the investigation of self-assembly processes involving lipids, peptides, and proteins.

abstract = {Self-assembly is a crucial component in the bottom-up fabrication of hierarchical supramolecular structures and advanced functional materials. Control has traditionally relied on the use of encoded building blocks bearing suitable moieties for recognition and interaction, with targeting of the thermodynamic equilibrium state. On the other hand, nature leverages the control of reaction-diffusion processes to create hierarchically organized materials with surprisingly complex biological functions. Indeed, under non-equilibrium conditions (kinetic control), the spatio-temporal command of chemical gradients and reactant mixing during self-assembly (the creation of non-uniform chemical environments for example) can strongly affect the outcome of the self-assembly process. This directly enables a precise control over material properties and functions. In this tutorial review, we show how the unique physical conditions offered by microfluidic technologies can be advantageously used to control the self-assembly of materials and of supramolecular aggregates in solution, making possible the isolation of intermediate states and unprecedented non-equilibrium structures, as well as the emergence of novel functions. Selected examples from the literature will be used to confirm that microfluidic devices are an invaluable toolbox technology for unveiling, understanding and steering self-assembly pathways to desired structures, properties and functions, as well as advanced processing tools for device fabrication and integration.},

abstract = {A set of disordered interacting building blocks may form ordered structures by means of a self-assembling process. An external intervention in the system by adding a chemical species or by applying forces leads to different self-assembly scenarios with the appearance of new structures. For instance, the formation of microtubules, gels, virus capsides, cells and living beings among others takes place by self-assembly under nonequilibrium conditions. A general evolution criterion able to account for why nature selects some structures outside equilibrium and not others is lacking. Nevertheless, progress in the understanding of nonequilibrium self-assembly (NESA) mechanisms has been made thanks to the formulation of models that take particular situations into consideration. We review recent efforts devoted to describing self-assembly out of equilibrium and we provide a reference linking several current concepts in order to help in the development of new models and experimental studies. We hope that the knowledge of the intimate mechanisms leading to the formation of structures will make the implementation of re-configurable and bio-inspired materials possible and give a simpler perspective on the understanding of the emergence of life.},

Once the same thermally fluctuating particles are driven away from equilibrium by forces that do work on the system over time, however, it becomes significantly more challenging to relate the likelihood of a given outcome to familiar thermodynamic quantities. Nonetheless, it has long been appreciated that developing a sound and general understanding of the thermodynamics of such non-equilibrium scenarios could ultimately enable us to control and imitate the marvellous successes that living things achieve in driven self-assembly. Here, I suggest that such a theoretical understanding may at last be emerging, and trace its development from historic first steps to more recent discoveries. Focusing on these newer results, I propose that they imply a general thermodynamic mechanism for self-organization via dissipation of absorbed work that may be applicable in a broad class of driven many-body systems.},

abstract = {The study of clay-based materials has many applications in civil and environmental engineering. These applications include underground nuclear waste disposal, the natural risks associated to the swelling and shrinkage of soils, and the extraction of hydrocarbons. They pose significant technological challenges that require to understand and to predict the mechanical behavior of clays, in particular on the long term. Swelling clays are complex porous multi-scale materials and their properties are very sensitive to water. In this thesis, we aim at understanding the impact of water on the short-term and long-term mechanical properties of clays. Our strategy was to combine numerical simulations at the scale of the nanometer and experiments at the scale of the micrometer to have a better insight of the interplay between these scales. We performed molecular simulations to estimate the effect of water and of the interlayer cation on the swelling, elastic and creep properties of clay layers, which are inaccessible to experiments at this scale. We also carried out a comparative study of various numerical models of increasing complexity in order to better understand the interactions that governs the cohesion between the clay layers. We measured experimentally the properties of well-ordered self-supporting clay films. We investigated the impact of relative humidity and of the nature of the interlayer cation on the mechanical properties of these clay films. In particular, we quantified the humidity-induced swelling of these films by using a combination of environmental scanning electron microscopy and digital image correlation. We also performed tensile tests and creep tests on these films at controlled relative humidity. We compared the data obtained by our experiments to the results of the molecular simulations. This comparison makes it possible to discuss the elementary deformation mechanisms and the scales relevant to the understanding of the hydromechanical behavior of clays.},

It is based on a new theory of screening of a macroion by multivalent cations, which shows that due to strong cation correlations at the surface of DNA the net charge of DNA changes sign at some small concentration of cations N0. DNA condensation takes place in the vicinity of N0, where absolute value of the DNA net charge is small and the correlation induced short range attraction dominates the Coulomb repulsion. At N{\textgreater}N0 positive DNA should move in the opposite direction in an electrophoresis experiment. From comparison of our theory with experimental values of condensation and resolubilization thresholds for DNA solution containing Spe4+, we obtain that N0 = 3.2mM and that the energy of DNA condensation per nucleotide is 0.07 kBT. {\textcopyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Significant progress was achieved with the application of Rietveld method to characterize the crystalline phases in portland cement paste. However, to obtain detailed information on the amorphous or poorly crystalline phases, it is necessary to analyze the total scattering data. The pair distribution function (PDF) method has been successfully used in the study of liquids and amorphous solids. The method takes the Sine Fourier transform of the measured structure factor over a wide momentum transfer range, providing a direct measure of the probability of finding an atom surrounding a central atom at a radial distance away. The obtained experimental characteristic distances can be also used to validate the predictions by the theoretical models, such as, molecular dynamics, ab initio simulations and density functional theory.

Although confirmed by a multitude of experimental methods for various systems, its mechanism remained unclear. A simulation technique is introduced that yields accurate pressures between solvated surfaces at prescribed water chemical potential and is applied to a stack of phospholipid bilayers. Experimental pressure data are quantitatively reproduced and the simulations unveil a rich microscopic picture: Direct membrane-membrane interactions are attractive but overwhelmed by repulsive indirect water contributions. Below about 17 water molecules per lipid, this indirect repulsion is of an energetic nature and due to desorption of hydration water; for larger hydration it is entropic and suggested to involve water depolarization. This antagonistic nature and the presence of various compensating contributions indicate that the hydration repulsion is less universal than previously assumed and rather involves finely tuned surface-water interactions.},

Moreover, soft, uniform colloidal aggregates are a promising candidate for quasicrystal and other hierarchical assemblies. In this work, we present a generic coarse-grained model that captures the formation of self-limited assemblies observed in various soft-matter systems including nanoparticles, colloids, and polyelectrolytes. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the assembly process is self-limited when the repulsion between the particles is renormalized to balance their attraction during aggregation. The uniform finite-sized aggregates are further shown to be thermodynamically stable and tunable with a single dimensionless parameter. We find large aggregates self-organize internally into a core-shell morphology and exhibit anomalous uniformity when the constituent nanoparticles have a polydisperse size distribution.},

We investigated the complexation of thermoresponsive anionic poly(                    N                    -isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM) microgels and cationic $\epsilon$-polylysine ($\epsilon$-PLL) chains. By combining electrophoresis, light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dielectric spectroscopy (DS) we studied the adsorption of $\epsilon$-PLL onto microgel networks and its effect on the stability of suspensions. We show that the volume phase transition (VPT) of microgels triggers a large polyion adsorption. Two interesting phenomena with unique features occur: a temperature-dependent microgel overcharging and a complex reentrant condensation. The latter may occur at fixed polyion concentration, when temperature is raised above the VPT of microgels, or by increasing the number density of polycations at fixed temperature. TEM and DS measurements unambiguously show that short PLL chains adsorb onto microgels and act as electrostatic glue above the VPT. By performing thermal cycles, we further show that polyion-induced clustering is a quasi-reversible process: within the time of our experiments large clusters form above the VPT and partially re-dissolve as the mixtures are cooled down. Finally we give a proof that the observed phenomenology is purely electrostatic in nature: an increase of the ionic strength gives rise to polyion desorption from the microgel outer shell.                  },

For the well-understood homogeneous dielectric case with no electrostatic images, the charges evenly condense on the opposite walls, thereby forming a bilayer Wigner crystal; five structures compete upon changing the inter-wall separation. Here, we consider a dielectric jump between the walls and a solvent in which charges are immersed, implying repulsive image--s. Using recently developed series representations of lattice sums for Coulomb law, we derive the complete phase diagram. In contrast to the homogeneous dielectric case, the particles remain in a hexagonal Wigner monolayer up to a certain distance between the walls. Beyond this distance, a bifurcation occurs to a sequence of Wigner bilayers, each layer having a nonzero spacing from the nearest wall. Another new phenomenon is that the ground-state energy as a function of the wall separation exhibits a global minimum.},

@article{Pellenq2008,
abstract = {On the basis of recent molecular simulation and experimental studies, we discuss two possible strategies for tuning the mechanical properties of cementitious materials by modifying the bonding scheme in the hydrates at molecular level. We focus the discussion on the calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). A first strategy would be based on the strengthening of the network of cohesion forces acting between the individual C-S-H lamellae or between their crystallites. Atomic scale simulations by ab initio, molecular dynamics and energy minimization techniques show that the iono-covalent forces between individual C-S-H layers or C-S-H layer stacks, separated by strongly localized calcium ions and water molecules, are orders of magnitude larger than the ionic correlation forces acting between C-S-H surfaces separated by nm- or multi-nm-thick layers of mobile water molecules and ions. The elastic properties derived from this iono-covalent bonding scheme are in good agreement with experimental values obtained by ultrasonic or statistical ("grid") nanoindentation techniques. The concept picture for C-S-H which follows is that of a crystalline semi-continuum, with dense domains ("crystallites" or "particles") iono-covalently bonded to each other, possibly entangled also, and embedded as long as the mesoscale porosity is water-saturated in a relatively weak attractive stress field due to fluctuating electrostatic forces. Depending on the size, the aspect ratio, and the turbostratic order of the crystallites, and also the composition of the interstitial solution, the relative importance of each contribution could be modified. This provides the basis for a better control of properties such as early age or long term strength development for instance. In this respect, the microstructure-properties relationships in clay minerals provide interesting leads, pointing to the importance of bonding continuity rather than bond strength. A second strategy to tune the mechanical properties of cement systems, akin to a biomimetic approach, is to hybridize the hydrates by grafting organic moieties on the mineral lamellae. This can be achieved by controlled hydrolysis of organo-silane precursor mixtures or by performing the hydration of the anhydrous silicates in silanized polymer solutions. The outcome may be materials with improved fracture energy and larger strain at failure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society. Calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) is the major binding phase responsible for strength and durability of cementitious materials. The cohesive properties of C-S-H are directly related to the intermolecular forces between its layers at the nanoscale. Here, we employ free energy perturbation theory (FEP) to calculate intermolecular forces between crystalline C-S-H layers solvated in aqueous medium along face-to-face (FTF) and sliding reaction coordinates. Contrary to mean-field theories, we find that our counterion-only system exhibits an oscillatory behavior in FTF interaction. We correlate these oscillations with the characteristic length scale comparable to the distance between interfacial water layers at the hydrophilic surface of crystalline C-S-H. We attribute the sliding intermolecular forces to the atomic level roughness of crystalline C-S-H layers stemming from the local arrangement of nanoscale structural motifs. These intermolecular forces provide a direct access to the key mechanical properties, such as surface energy, cohesive pressure and elastic properties. The simulation results are in close agreement with the available experimental measurements. Furthermore, we present these intermolecular forces in a mathematical framework to facilitate coarse-grain modeling of crystalline C-S-H layers. These results provide a novel route that paves the way for developing realistic mesoscale models to explore the origins of chemophysical properties of crystalline C-S-H. (Figure Presented).},

Here, we address the biophysical mechanism of this multiphase organization using quantitative reconstitution of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) with attached P-bodies in human cells. Protein-interaction networks can be viewed as interconnected complexes (nodes) of RNA-binding domains (RBDs), whose integrated RNA-binding capacity determines whether LLPS occurs upon RNA influx. Surprisingly, both RBD-RNA specificity and disordered segments of key proteins are non-essential, but modulate multiphase condensation. Instead, stoichiometry-dependent competition between protein networks for connecting nodes determines SG and P-body composition and miscibility, while competitive binding of unconnected proteins disengages networks and prevents LLPS. Inspired by patchy colloid theory, we propose a general framework by which competing networks give rise to compositionally specific and tunable condensates, while relative linkage between nodes underlies multiphase organization.},

By modeling the energetics ofthe DNA toroid usinga free-energy functional composed of energy contributions related to the elasticity of the wound DNA, exposed surface DNA energy, and adhesion between the DNA and the capsid, we established that the crescent shape of the toroidal DNA section comes from attractive interactions between DNA and the capsid.

Analytical results for the particle density profile and the pressure are in good agreement with numerical Monte Carlo data, for small as well as intermediate values of d comparable with the Wigner lattice spacing.

abstract = {A remarkable variety of organisms and wet materials are able to endure temperatures far below the freezing point of bulk water. Cryo-tolerance in biology is usually attributed to "anti-freeze" proteins, and yet massive supercooling ({\$}{\textless} -40{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$}C) is also possible in porous media containing only simple aqueous electrolytes. For concrete pavements, the common wisdom is that freeze-thaw damage results from the expansion of water upon freezing, but this cannot explain the large pressures ({\$}{\textgreater} 10{\$}{\~{}}MPa) required to damage concrete, the observed correlation between pavement damage and de-icing salts, or the damage of cement paste loaded with benzene (which contracts upon freezing). In this Letter, we propose a different mechanism -- nanofluidic salt trapping -- which can explain the observations, using simple mathematical models of dissolved ions confined to thin liquid films between growing ice and charged surfaces. Although trapped salt lowers the freezing point, ice nucleation in charged pores causes enormous disjoining pressures via the rejected ions, until their removal by precipitation or surface adsorption at a lower temperatures releases the pressure and allows complete freezing. The theory is able to predict the non-monotonic salt-concentration dependence of freeze-thaw damage in concreter and provides a general framework to understand the origins of cryo-tolerance.},

We investigate these fluctuations using molecular dynamics simulations in a constant-potential ensemble with histogram reweighting techniques. This approach offers in particular an efficient, accurate and physically insightful route to the differential capacitance that is broadly applicable. We demonstrate these methods with three different capacitors: pure water between platinum electrodes, and a pure as well as a solvent-based organic electrolyte each between graphite electrodes. The total charge distributions with the pure solvent and solvent-based electrolytes are remarkably Gaussian, while in the pure ionic liquid the total charge distribution displays distinct non-Gaussian features, suggesting significant potential-driven changes in the organization of the interfacial fluid.},

We find that the water flow induces, apart from the well-known streaming potential, also a strongly heterogeneous surface charge and zeta-potential on chemically homogeneous channel walls. Moreover, we identify a novel steady state with a nontrivial 3D electric flux with 2D surface charges acting as sources and sinks. For a pulsed pressure drop our findings also provide a first-principles explanation for ill-understood experiments on the effect of flow on interfacial chemistry [D.

abstract = {The response of a model micro-electrochemical system to a time-dependent applied voltage is analyzed. The article begins with a fresh historical review including electrochemistry, colloidal science, and microfluidics. The model problem consists of a symmetric binary electrolyte between parallel-plate, blocking electrodes which suddenly apply a voltage. Compact Stern layers on the electrodes are also taken into account. The Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are first linearized and solved by Laplace transforms for small voltages, and numerical solutions are obtained for large voltages. The ``weakly nonlinear'' limit of thin double layers is then analyzed by matched asymptotic expansions in the small parameter {\$}\backslashepsilon = \backslashlambda{\_}D/L{\$}, where {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}D{\$} is the screening length and {\$}L{\$} the electrode separation. At leading order, the system initially behaves like an RC circuit with a response time of {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}D L / D{\$} (not {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}D{\^{}}2/D{\$}), where {\$}D{\$} is the ionic diffusivity, but nonlinearity violates this common picture and introduce multiple time scales. The charging process slows down, and neutral-salt adsorption by the diffuse part of the double layer couples to bulk diffusion at the time scale, {\$}L{\^{}}2/D{\$}. In the ``strongly nonlinear'' regime (controlled by a dimensionless parameter resembling the Dukhin number), this effect produces bulk concentration gradients, and, at very large voltages, transient space charge. The article concludes with an overview of more general situations involving surface conduction, multi-component electrolytes, and Faradaic processes.},

It is the archetype of entropic forces, both trivial in its fundamental expression – the van 't Hoff perfect gas law – and highly subtle in its physical roots. While osmosis is intimately linked with transport across membranes, it also manifests itself as an interfacial transport phenomenon: the so-called diffusio-osmosis and -phoresis, whose consequences are presently actively explored for example for the manipulation of colloidal suspensions or the development of active colloidal swimmers. Here we give a global and unifying view of the phenomenon of osmosis and its consequences with a multi-disciplinary perspective. Pushing the fundamental understanding of osmosis allows one to propose new perspectives for different fields and we highlight a number of examples along these lines, for example introducing the concepts of osmotic diodes, active separation and far from equilibrium osmosis, raising in turn fundamental questions in the thermodynamics of separation. The applications of osmosis are also obviously considerable and span very diverse fields. Here we discuss a selection of phenomena and applications where osmosis shows great promises: osmotic phenomena in membrane science (with recent developments in separation, desalination, reverse osmosis for water purification thanks in particular to the emergence of new nanomaterials); applications in biology and health (in particular discussing the kidney filtration process); osmosis and energy harvesting (in particular, osmotic power and blue energy as well as capacitive mixing); applications in detergency and cleaning, as well as for oil recovery in porous media.},

The theory is based on an asymmetric treatment of the different components of the electrolyte solution. The weak coupling Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel approach is used in order to describe the monovalent salt ions while a strong coupling approach is used to tackle the polyvalent counterions. This combined weak-strong coupling approach effectively leads to dressed interactions between polyvalent counterions and thus directly affects the correlation attraction mediated by polyvalent counterions between like-charged objects. The general theory is specifically applied to a system composed of two uniformly charged plane-parallel surfaces in the presence of salt and polyvalent counterions. In the strong coupling limit for polyvalent counterions, the comparison with Monte Carlo simulations shows good agreement for large enough values of the electrostatic coupling parameter. We delineate two limiting laws that in fact encompass all the Monte Carlo data.},

abstract = {Inactivation is the process by which ion channels terminate ion flux through their pores while the opening stimulus is still present1. In neurons, inactivation of both sodium and potassium channels is crucial for the generation of action potentials and regulation of firing frequency1,2. A cytoplasmic domain of either the channel or an accessory subunit is thought to plug the open pore to inactivate the channel via a ‘ball-and-chain' mechanism3–7. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to identify the molecular gating mechanism in calcium-activated potassium channels by obtaining structures of the MthK channel from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum—a purely calcium-gated and inactivating channel—in a lipid environment. In the absence of Ca2+, we obtained a single structure in a closed state, which was shown by atomistic simulations to be highly flexible in lipid bilayers at ambient temperature, with large rocking motions of the gating ring and bending of pore-lining helices. In Ca2+-bound conditions, we obtained several structures, including multiple open-inactivated conformations, further indication of a highly dynamic protein. These different channel conformations are distinguished by rocking of the gating rings with respect to the transmembrane region, indicating symmetry breakage across the channel. Furthermore, in all conformations displaying open channel pores, the N terminus of one subunit of the channel tetramer sticks into the pore and plugs it, with free energy simulations showing that this is a strong interaction. Deletion of this N terminus leads to functionally non-inactivating channels and structures of open states without a pore plug, indicating that this previously unresolved N-terminal peptide is responsible for a ball-and-chain inactivation mechanism. Cryo-electron microscopy structures and molecular dynamics simulations of the calcium-activated potassium channel MthK from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum are used to show that gating of this channel involves a ball-and-chain inactivation mechanism mediated by a previously unresolved N-terminal peptide.},

Basic creep of cementitious materials is now known to be non-asymptotic and evolve logarithmically with time at large times. However, the long-term kinetics of autogenous shrinkage is not systematically analyzed. Here we first aim at finding out how autogenous shrinkage evolves with time at long term. We analyze all experimental data available in the literature and find that autogenous shrinkage evolves logarithmically with respect to time at long term, like basic creep. Then, by considering concrete as a multiscale material, we obtain the bulk creep modulus of the calcium silicate hydrate gel. In the end, we show that the kinetics of long-term autogenous shrinkage can be a viscoelastic response to self-desiccation by comparing the mechanical stress that should be applied to explain this long-term kinetics of autogenous shrinkage with the capillary force due to self-desiccation.},

In relict lime clasts, the crystals have calcium contents that are similar to ideal tobermorite, 33 to 35 wt{\%}, but the low-silica contents, 39 to 40 wt{\%}, reflect Al3+ substitution for Si4+ in Q2(1Al), Q3(1Al), and Q3(2 Al) tetrahedral chain and branching sites. The Al-tobermorite has a double silicate chain structure with long chain lengths in the b [020] crystallographic direction, and wide interlayer spacing, 11.49 {\AA}. Na+ and K+ partially balance Al3+ substitution for Si4+. Poorly crystalline calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate (C-A-S-H) cementitious binder in the dissolved perimeter of relict lime clasts has Ca/(Si+Al) = 0.79, nearly identical to the Al-tobermorite, but nanoscale heterogeneities with aluminum in both tetrahedral and octahedral coordination. The concrete is about 45 vol{\%} glassy zeolitic tuff and 55 vol{\%} hydrated lime-volcanic ash mortar; lime formed {\textless}10 wt{\%} of the mix. Trace element studies confirm that the pyroclastic rock comes from Flegrean Fields volcanic district, as described in ancient Roman texts. An adiabatic thermal model of the 10 m2 by 5.7 m thick Baianus Sinus breakwater from heat evolved through hydration of lime and formation of C-A-S-H suggests maximum temperatures of 85 to 97 {\textordmasculine}C. Cooling to seawater temperatures occurred in two years. These elevated temperatures and the mineralizing effects of seawater and alkali- and alumina-rich volcanic ash appear to be critical to Al-tobermorite crystallization. The long-term stability of the Al-tobermorite provides a valuable context to improve future syntheses in innovative concretes with advanced properties using volcanic pozzolans.},

This creep occurs at a rate that deteriorates the durability and truncates the lifespan of concrete structures. However, despite decades of research, the origin of concrete creep remains unknown. Here, we measure the in situ creep behavior of calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H), the nano-meter sized particles that form the fundamental building block of Portland cement concrete. We show that C-S-H exhibits a logarithmic creep that depends only on the packing of 3 structurally distinct but compositionally similar C-S-H forms: low density, high density, ultra-high density. We demonstrate that the creep rate (≈1/t) is likely due to the rearrangement of nanoscale particles around limit packing densities following the free-volume dynamics theory of granular physics. These findings could lead to a new basis for nanoengineering concrete materials and structures with minimal creep rates monitored by packing density distributions of nanoscale particles, and predicted by nanoscale creep measurements in some minute time, which are as exact as macroscopic creep tests carried out over years.},

Myosin II molecules contain a long coiled-coil rod that mediates filament assembly required for myosin II to exert its full activity. The exact mechanisms orchestrating filament assembly are not fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings. Here we examine mechanisms controlling filament assembly of non-muscle myosin IIB heavy chain (MHC-IIB). We show that in vivo the entire C-terminus region of net positive charge, found in myosin II rods, is important for self-assembly of MHC-IIB fragments. In contrast, no particular sequences in the rod region with net negative charge were identified as important for self-assembly, yet a minimal area from this region is necessary. Proper paracrystal formation by MHC-IIB fragments requires the 196aa charge periodicity along the entire coiled-coil region. In vivo, in contrast to self-assembly in vitro, negatively-charged regions of the coiled-coil were found to play an important role by controlling the intracellular localization of native MHC-IIB. The entire positively-charged region is also important for intracelluar localization of native MHC-IIB. Conclusions/Significance. A correct distribution of positive and negative charges along myosin II rod is a necessary component in proper filament assembly and intracellular localization of MHC-IIB. {\textcopyright} 2008 Rosenberg et al.},

At large Coulombic couplings, approaching the two charged bodies leads to an unbinding of counter-ions, a situation that is amenable to an exact treatment. This phenomenon is the key to attractive effective interactions. A particular effort is made for pedagogy, keeping equations and formalism to a minimum.},

abstract = {Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) are fast routes to the final results of slow, adiabatic changes of the controlling parameters of a system. The shortcuts are designed by a set of analytical and numerical methods suitable for different systems and conditions. A motivation to apply STA methods to quantum systems is to manipulate them in timescales shorter than decoherence times. Thus shortcuts to adiabaticity have become instrumental in preparing and driving internal and motional states in atomic, molecular, or solid-state physics. Applications range from information transfer and processing based on gates or analog paradigms, to interferometry and metrology. The multiplicity of STA paths for the controlling parameters may be used to enhance robustness versus noise and perturbations, or to optimize relevant variables. Since adiabaticity is a widespread phenomenon, STA methods also extended beyond the quantum world to optical devices, classical mechanical systems, and mechanical engineering or statistical physics. Shortcuts to adiabaticity combine well with other concepts and techniques, in particular with optimal control theory, and pose fundamental scientific and engineering questions such as finding speed limits, quantifying the third principle, or determining process energy costs and efficiencies. We review concepts, methods and applications of shortcuts to adiabaticity and outline promising prospects, as well as open questions and challenges ahead.},

Significant differences are found between short and medium-length chains of different tacticity, while for long chains all shape measures converge to a common limit. The detailed three-dimensional segment density distributions are examined, and they are found to be bimodal along the longest principal axis of gyration. The loci of highest segment density are always two clearly separated domains, not containing the center of gyration, and they lie on the major principal axis separated by ca. 1.3〈S2〉01/2-2.0〈S2〉01/2.

The solvent is described at the primitive model (PM) level and also as a Stockmayer fluid. Both descriptions share the same qualitative ion correlation picture. At sufficiently high coupling, the pressure between the plates shows an attractive minimum, which is lost or reduced upon decreasing counterion valency, surface charge density, or increasing the screening. The pressure profiles become more oscillatory with higher density, which masks the ion-ion correlation attraction. An interpretation in terms of interaction free energies rather than pressures clarifies the picture. Analyzing the different contributions to the pressure gives further support to the conclusions; the same components are responsible for the same effect in the PM and in the molecular solvent. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Gmira2004,
abstract = {Contrary to other porous materials such as sandstones, bricks or porous glass, the inter-atomic bonding continuity of cement-based materials is far from obvious. When scrutinized at very microscopic level, continuity of the ioniccovalent bonding in the solid phase is almost everywhere interrupted by water molecules or liquid water films of variable thickness. Yet, concrete and cement pastes are able to withstand stresses of the same magnitude as rocks. The purpose of this paper to explore the possible reasons for such a high cohesion in terms of inter-particle forces using general arguments and molecular simulation computations including ab initio quantum chemical methods applied to C-S-H. As it will be discussed, molecular simulation studies provide strong arguments for predicting that short- and medium-range attractive electrostatic forces are the essential components of the cohesion of C-S-H with, at short distance (sub-nm), a significant iono-covalent contribution involving strongly localized calcium ions and water molecules and, at larger distance (a few nm), ionic correlation forces involving hydrated and mobile calcium ions in liquid water films. Only a marginal contribution is expected from van der Waals attraction whereas capillary forces might contribute at a level comparable to that of correlation forces in unsaturated conditions. The parallel with clay-based earthen construction materials is part of the clue of this rationale.},

abstract = {The fibrous collagens are ubiquitous in animals and form the structural basis of all mammalian connective tissues, including those of the heart, vasculature, skin, cornea, bones, and tendons. However, in comparison with what is known of their production, turnover and physiological structure, very little is understood regarding the three-dimensional arrangement of collagen molecules in naturally occurring fibrils. This knowledge may provide insight into key biological processes such as fibrillo-genesis and tissue remodeling and into diseases such as heart disease and cancer. Here we present a crystallographic determination of the collagen type I supermolecular structure, where the molecular conformation of each collagen segment found within the naturally occurring crystallographic unit cell has been defined (P1, a ≈ 40.0 {\AA}, b ≈ 27.0 {\AA}, c ≈ 678 {\AA}, $\alpha$ ≈ 89.2°, $\beta$ ≈ 94.6°, $\gamma$ ≈ 105.6°; reflections: 414, overlapping, 232, and nonoverlapping, 182; resolution, 5.16 {\AA} axial and 11.1 {\AA} equatorial). This structure shows that the molecular packing topology of the collagen molecule is such that packing neighbors are arranged to form a supertwisted (discontinuous) right-handed microfibril that interdigitates with neighboring microfibrils. This interdigitation establishes the crystallographic superlattice, which is formed of quasihexagonally packed collagen molecules. In addition, the molecular packing structure of collagen shown here provides information concerning the potential modes of action of two prominent molecules involved in human health and disease: decorin and the Matrix Metallo-Proteinase (MMP) collagenase. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Cells are organized on length scales ranging from {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m to micrometres. However, the mechanisms by which {\"{a}}ngstr{\"{o}}m-scale molecular properties are translated to micrometre-scale macroscopic properties are not well understood. Here we show that interactions between diverse synthetic, multivalent macromolecules (including multi-domain proteins and RNA) produce sharp liquid-liquid-demixing phase separations, generating micrometre-sized liquid droplets in aqueous solution. This macroscopic transition corresponds to a molecular transition between small complexes and large, dynamic supramolecular polymers. The concentrations needed for phase transition are directly related to the valency of the interacting species. In the case of the actin-regulatory protein called neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) interacting with its established biological partners NCK and phosphorylated nephrin, the phase transition corresponds to a sharp increase in activity towards an actin nucleation factor, the Arp2/3 complex. The transition is governed by the degree of phosphorylation of nephrin, explaining how this property of the system can be controlled to regulatory effect by kinases. The widespread occurrence of multivalent systems suggests that phase transitions may be used to spatially organize and biochemically regulate information throughout biology. {\textcopyright}2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Dynamic molecular clusters are assembled through weak multivalent interactions and are platforms for cellular functions, especially receptor-mediated signaling. Clustering is also a prerequisite for liquid-liquid phase separation. It is not well understood, however, how molecular structure and cellular organization control clustering. Using coarse-grained kinetic Langevin dynamics, we performed computational experiments on a prototypical ternary system modeled after membrane-bound nephrin, the adaptor Nck1, and the actin nucleation promoting factor NWASP. Steady-state cluster size distributions favored stoichiometries that optimized binding (stoichiometry matching) but still were quite broad. At high concentrations, the system can be driven beyond the saturation boundary such that cluster size is limited only by the number of available molecules. This behavior would be predictive of phase separation. Domains close to binding sites sterically inhibited clustering much less than terminal domains because the latter effectively restrict access to the cluster interior. Increased flexibility of interacting molecules diminished clustering by shielding binding sites within compact conformations. Membrane association of nephrin increased the cluster size distribution in a density-dependent manner. These properties provide insights into how molecular ensembles function to localize and amplify cell signaling.},

Achieving single ion transport that is tunable by an external gate—the ionic analogue of electronic Coulomb blockade—would open new avenues in this quest. However, an understanding of ionic Coulomb blockade beyond the electronic analogy is still lacking. Here, we show that the many-body dynamics of ions in a charged nanochannel result in quantized and strongly nonlinear ionic transport, in full agreement with molecular simulations. We find that ionic Coulomb blockade occurs when, upon sufficient confinement, oppositely charged ions form ‘Bjerrum pairs', and the conduction proceeds through a mechanism reminiscent of Onsager's Wien effect.

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to discuss the applicability of the tobermorite-jennite (T/J) and tobermorite-'solid-solution' calcium hydroxide (T/CH) viewpoints for the nanostructure of C-S-H present in real cement pastes. The discussion is facilitated by a consideration of the author's 1992 model, which includes formulations for both structural viewpoints; its relationship to other recent models is outlined. The structural details of the model are clearly illustrated with a number of schematic diagrams. Experimental observations on the nature of C-S-H present in a diverse range of cementitious systems are considered. In some systems, the data can only be accounted for on the T/CH structural viewpoint, whilst in others, both the T/CH and T/J viewpoints could apply. New data from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are presented. The 'inner product' (Ip) C-S-H in relatively large grains of C 3 S or alite appears to consist of small globular particles, which are ≈4-8 nm in size in pastes hydrated at 20 °C but smaller at elevated temperatures, ≈3-4 nm. Fibrils of 'outer product' (Op) C-S-H in C 3 S or $\beta$-C 2 S pastes appear to consist of aggregations of long thin particles that are about 3 nm in their smallest dimension and of variable length, ranging from a few nanometers to many tens of nanometers. The small size of these particles of C-S-H is likely to result in significant edge effects, which would seem to offer a reasonable explanation for the persistence of Q 0 (H) species. This would also explain why there is more Q 0 (H) at elevated temperatures, where the particles seem to be smaller, and apparently less in KOH-activated pastes, where the C-S-H has foil-like morphology. In blended cements, a reduction in the mean Ca/Si ratio of the C-S-H results in a change from fibrillar to a crumpled-foil morphology, which suggests strongly that as the Ca/Si ratio is reduced, a transition occurs from essentially one-dimensional growth of the C-S-H particles to two-dimensional; i.e., long thin particles to foils. Foil-like morphology is associated with T-based structure. The C-S-H present in small fully hydrated alite grains, which has high Ca/Si ratio, contains a less dense product with substantial porosity; its morphology is quite similar to the fine foil-like Op C-S-H that forms in water-activated neat slag pastes, which has a low Ca/Si ratio. It is thus plausible that the C-S-H in small alite grains is essentially T-based (and largely dimeric). Since entirely T-based C-S-H is likely to have different properties to C-S-H consisting largely of J-based structure, it is possible that the C-S-H in small fully reacted grains will have different properties to the C-S-H formed elsewhere in a paste; this could have important implications. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This includes oligomeric proteins composed of several smaller monomers, as well as protein complexes assembled from a few proteins. By studying the generic spatial transport properties of such proteins, we investigate here whether their ability to reversibly associate and dissociate may confer them a functional advantage with respect to non-dissociating proteins. In uniform environments with position-independent association-dissociation, we find that enhanced diffusion in the monomeric state coupled to reassociation into the functional oligomeric form leads to enhanced reactivity with distant targets. In non-uniform environments with position-dependent association-dissociation, caused e.g. by spatial gradients of an inhibiting chemical, we find that dissociating proteins generically tend to accumulate in regions where they are most stable, a process that we term 'stabilitaxis'.},

The excellent electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is due to a reversible ion adsorption in porous carbon electrodes. Recently, it was demonstrated that ions from the electrolyte could enter sub nanometre pores, greatly increasing the capacitance. However, the molecular mechanism of this enhancement remains poorly understood. Here we provide the first quantitative picture of the structure of an ionic liquid adsorbed inside realistically modelled microporous carbon electrodes. We show how the separation of the positive and negative ions occurs inside the porous disordered carbons, yielding much higher capacitance values (125 F g(-1)) than with simpler electrode geometries. The proposed mechanism opens the door for the design of materials with improved energy storage capabilities. It also sheds new light on situations where ion adsorption in porous structures or membranes plays a role.},

abstract = {Gelation and densification of calcium–silicate–hydrate take place during cement hydration. Both processes are crucial for the development of cement strength, and for the long-term evolution of concrete structures. However, the physicochemical environment evolves during cement formation, making it difficult to disentangle what factors are crucial for the mechanical properties. Here we use Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations to study a coarse-grained model of cement formation, and investigate the equilibrium and arrested states. We can correlate the various structures with the time evolution of the interactions between the nano-hydrates during the preparation of cement. The novel emerging picture is that the changes of the physicochemical environment, which dictate the evolution of the effective interactions, specifically favour the early gel formation and its continuous densification. Our observations help us understand how cement attains its unique strength and may help in the rational design of the properties of cement and related materials. 1Department},

@article{Bazant2009,
abstract = {The venerable theory of electrokinetic phenomena rests on the hypothesis of a dilute solution of point-like ions in quasi-equilibrium with a weakly charged surface, whose potential relative to the bulk is of order the thermal voltage (kT/e ≈ 25 mV at room temperature). In nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, such as AC or induced-charge electro-osmosis (ACEO, ICEO) and induced-charge electrophoresis (ICEP), several V ≈ 100 kT/e are applied to polarizable surfaces in microscopic geometries, and the resulting electric fields and induced surface charges are large enough to violate the assumptions of the classical theory. In this article, we review the experimental and theoretical literatures, highlight discrepancies between theory and experiment, introduce possible modifications of the theory, and analyze their consequences. We argue that, in response to a large applied voltage, the "compact layer" and "shear plane" effectively advance into the liquid, due to the crowding of counterions. Using simple continuum models, we predict two general trends at large voltages: (i) ionic crowding against a blocking surface expands the diffuse double layer and thus decreases its differential capacitance, and (ii) a charge-induced viscosity increase near the surface reduces the electro-osmotic mobility; each trend is enhanced by dielectric saturation. The first effect is able to predict high-frequency flow reversal in ACEO pumps, while the second may explain the decay of ICEO flow with increasing salt concentration. Through several colloidal examples, such as ICEP of an uncharged metal sphere in an asymmetric electrolyte, we show that nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena are generally ion-specific. Similar theoretical issues arise in nanofluidics (due to confinement) and ionic liquids (due to the lack of solvent), so the paper concludes with a general framework of modified electrokinetic equations for finite-sized ions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This review will summarize the recent literature on coacervation/precipitation in protein-polyelectrolyte systems for which reports are most abundant, particularly in the context of food science. We present current findings and opinions about the relationship between the two types of phase separation. Results vary considerably depending not only on the protein-polyelectrolyte pairs chosen, but also on conditions including macromolecular concentrations and ionic strength.

abstract = {We study the ground-state properties of a system of identical classical Coulombic point particles, evenly distributed between two equivalently charged parallel plates at distance d; the system as a whole is electroneutral. It was previously shown that upon increasing d from 0 to ∞, five different structures of the bilayer Wigner crystal become energetically favored, starting from a hexagonal lattice (phase I, d=0) and ending at a staggered hexagonal lattice (phase V, d→∞). In this paper, we derive series representations of the ground-state energy for all five bilayer structures. The derivation is based on a sequence of transformations for lattice sums of Coulomb two-particle potentials plus the neutralizing background, having their origin in the general theory of Jacobi theta functions. The series proposed in this manuscript provide convenient starting points for both analytical and numerical progress. Its convergence properties are indeed excellent: truncation at the fourth term determines in general the energy correctly up to 17 decimal digits. The accurate series representations are used to improve the specification of transition points between the phases and to solve a controversy in previous studies. In particular, it is shown both analytically and numerically that the hexagonal phase I is stable only at d=0, and not in a finite interval of small distances between the plates as was anticipated before. The expansions of the structure energies around second-order transition points can be done analytically, which enables us to show that the critical behavior is of the Ginzburg-Landau type, with a mean-field critical index $\beta$=1/2 for the growth of the order parameters.},

Dielectric spectroscopy can be used to determine the dipole moment of colloidal particles from which important interfacial electrokinetic properties, for instance their zeta potential, can be deduced. Unfortunately, dielectric spectroscopy measurements are hampered by electrode polarization (EP). In this article, we review several procedures to compensate for this effect. First EP in electrolyte solutions is described: the complex conductivity is derived as function of frequency, for two cell geometries (planar and cylindrical) with blocking electrodes. The corresponding equivalent circuit for the electrolyte solution is given for each geometry. This equivalent circuit model is extended to suspensions. The complex conductivity of a suspension, in the presence of EP, is then calculated from the impedance. Different methods for compensating for EP are critically assessed, with the help of the theoretical findings. Their limit of validity is given in terms of characteristic frequencies. We can identify with one of these frequencies the frequency range within which data uncorrected for EP may be used to assess the dipole moment of colloidal particles. In order to extract this dipole moment from the measured data, two methods are reviewed: one is based on the use of existing models for the complex conductivity of suspensions, the other is the logarithmic derivative method. An extension to multiple relaxations of the logarithmic derivative method is proposed.},

Many researchers have assumed that relatively pure polymers can be treated as ide band gap semi-conductors but other scientists have believed that most non-conjugated polymers conduct by the movement of ions. Part of the trouble is that many of the theories predict dependences of current on voltage and sample thickness too similar to easily distinguish between the assumed mechanisms unless extensive and very good data are available. Some comparisons are discussed. More recent approaches that use pressure as an added variable, or those that give careful consideration to such things as gas evolution often allo one to deduce the predominant type of conduction. The concept of local structure of a polymer in the neighborhood of an ion is considered along with the relation of ionic conduction to the entropy correlation theory recently developed by Barker and applied to the case of diffusion in oriented polymers by Barker, Tsai, and illency. According to the evidence, the activation entropy increases under the action of an organizing effect such as uniaxial elongation. Moisture has to important effects on conduction in polymers. At lo concentrations it contributes charge carriers by its on dissociation and at higher concentrations it enhances the dissociation of other ionic species present. Some data for the correlation of conductivity and dielectric constant of solid polymers are discussed in terms of the eak electrolyte model developed by Sharbaugh and Barker for organic liquids. The existence of the correlation seems to imply that many polymers, under most circumstances, are predominantly ionic conductors. {\textcopyright} 1976, Walter de Gruyter. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The field of supramolecular chemistry focuses on the non-covalent interactions between molecules that give rise to molecular recognition and self-assembly processes. Since most non-covalent interactions are relatively weak and form and break without significant activation barriers, many supramolecular systems are under thermodynamic control. Hence, traditionally, supramolecular chemistry has focused predominantly on systems at equilibrium. However, more recently, self-assembly processes that are governed by kinetics, where the outcome of the assembly process is dictated by the assembly pathway rather than the free energy of the final assembled state, are becoming topical. Within the kinetic regime it is possible to distinguish between systems that reside in a kinetic trap and systems that are far from equilibrium and require a continuous supply of energy to maintain a stationary state. In particular, the latter systems have vast functional potential, as they allow, in principle, for more elaborate structural and functional diversity of self-assembled systems-indeed, life is a prime example of a far-from-equilibrium system. In this Review, we compare the different thermodynamic regimes using some selected examples and discuss some of the challenges that need to be addressed when developing new functional supramolecular systems.},

abstract = {The rapid and efficient exchange of ions between porous electrodes and aqueous solutions is important in many applications, such as electrical energy storage by supercapacitors, water desalination and purification by capacitive deionization, and capacitive extraction of renewable energy from a salinity difference. Here, we present a unified mean-field theory for capacitive charging and desalination by ideally polarizable porous electrodes (without Faradaic reactions or specific adsorption of ions) valid in the limit of thin double layers (compared to typical pore dimensions). We illustrate the theory for the case of a dilute, symmetric, binary electrolyte using the Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) model of the double layer, for which simple formulae are available for salt adsorption and capacitive charging of the diffuse part of the double layer. We solve the full GCS mean-field theory numerically for realistic parameters in capacitive deionization, and we derive reduced models for two limiting regimes with different time scales: (i) in the "supercapacitor regime" of small voltages and/or early times, the porous electrode acts like a transmission line, governed by a linear diffusion equation for the electrostatic potential, scaled to the RC time of a single pore, and (ii) in the "desalination regime" of large voltages and long times, the porous electrode slowly absorbs counterions, governed by coupled, nonlinear diffusion equations for the pore-averaged potential and salt concentration.},

abstract = {In bionanotechnology, the field of creating functional materials consisting of bio-inspired molecules, the function and shape of a nanostructure only appear through the assembly of many small molecules together. The large number of building blocks required to define a nanostructure combined with the many degrees of freedom in packing small molecules has long precluded molecular simulations, but recent advances in computational hardware as well as software have made classical simulations available to this strongly expanding field. Here, we review the state of the art in simulations of self-assembling bio-inspired supramolecular systems. We will first discuss progress in force fields, simulation protocols and enhanced sampling techniques using recent examples. Secondly, we will focus on efforts to enable the comparison of experimentally accessible observables and computational results. Experimental quantities that can be measured by microscopy, spectroscopy and scattering can be linked to simulation output either directly or indirectly, via quantum mechanical or semi-empirical techniques. Overall, we aim to provide an overview of the various computational approaches to understand not only the molecular architecture of nanostructures, but also the mechanism of their formation.},

abstract = {The T cell antigen receptor encounters foreign antigen during the immune response. Receptor engagement leads to activation of specific protein tyrosine kinases, which then phosphorylate multiple enzymes and adapter proteins. One such enzyme, phospholipase-C$\gamma$1, is responsible for cleavage of a plasma membrane lipid substrate, a phosphoinositide, into two second messengers, diacylglycerol, which activates several enzymes including protein kinase C, and an inositol phosphate, which induces intracellular calcium elevation. In T cells, phospholipase-C$\gamma$1 is recruited to the plasma membrane as part of a four-protein complex containing three adapter molecules. We have used recombinant proteins and synthetic phosphopeptides to reconstitute this quaternary complex in vitro. Extending biophysical tools to study concurrent interactions of the four protein components, we demonstrated the formation and determined the composition of the quaternary complex using multisignal analytical ultracentrifugation, and we characterized the thermodynamic driving forces of assembly by isothermal calorimetry. We demonstrate that the four proteins reversibly associate in a circular arrangement of binding interfaces, each protein interacting with two others. Three interactions are of high affinity, and the fourth is of low affinity, with the assembly of the quaternary complex exhibiting significant enthalpy–entropy compensation as in an entropic switch. Formation of this protein complex enables subsequent recruitment of additional molecules needed to activate phospholipase-C$\gamma$1. Understanding the formation of this complex is fundamental to full characterization of a central pathway in T cell activation. Such knowledge is critical to developing ways in which this pathway can be selectively inhibited.},

abstract = {Screening of a strongly charged macroion by multivalent counterions is considered. It is shown that coun- terions form a strongly correlated liquid at the surface of the macroion. Cohesive energy of this liquid leads to additional attraction of counterions to the surface, which is absent in conventional solutions of the Poisson- Boltzmann equation. Away from the surface this attraction can be taken into account by a new boundary condition for the concentration of counterions near the surface. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is solved with this boundary condition for a charged flat surface, a cylinder, and a sphere. In all three cases, screening is much stronger than in the conventional approach. At some critical exponentially small concentration of multivalent counterions in the solution, they totally neutralize the surface charge at small distances from the surface. At larger concentrations they invert the sign of the net macroion charge. The absolute value of the inverted charge density can be as large as 20{\%} of the bare one. In particular, for a cylindrical macroion it is shown that for screening by multivalent counterions, predictions of the Onsager-Manning theory are quantitatively incorrect. The net charge density of the cylinder is smaller than their theory predicts and inverts the sign with a growing concentration of counterions. Moreover, the condensation loses its universality and the net charge linear density depends on the bare one. ?S1063-651X?99?11311-4?},

abstract = {The cytoskeletal protein actin polymerizes into filaments that are essential for the mechanical stability of mammalian cells. In vitro experiments showed that direct interactions between actin filaments and lipid bilayers are possible and that the net charge of the bilayer as well as the presence of divalent ions in the buffer play an important role. In vivo, colocalization of actin filaments and divalent ions are suppressed, and cells rely on linker proteins to connect the plasma membrane to the actin network. Little is known, however, about why this is the case and what microscopic interactions are important. A deeper understanding is highly beneficial, first, to obtain understanding in the biological design of cells and, second, as a possible basis for the building of artificial cortices for the stabilization of synthetic cells. Here, we report the results of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of monomeric and filamentous actin in the vicinity of differently charged lipid bilayers. We observe that charges on the lipid head groups strongly determine the ability of actin to adsorb to the bilayer. The inclusion of divalent ions leads to a reversal of the binding affinity. Our in silico results are validated experimentally by reconstitution assays with actin on lipid bilayer membranes and provide a molecular-level understanding of the actin-membrane interaction.},

abstract = {Biological membranes typically contain a large number of different components dispersed in small concentrations in the main membrane phase, including proteins, sugars, and lipids of varying geometrical properties. Most of these components do not bind the cargo. Here, we show that such "inert" components can be crucial for the precise control of cross-membrane trafficking. Using a statistical mechanics model and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of inert membrane components of small isotropic curvatures dramatically influences cargo endocytosis, even if the total spontaneous curvature of such a membrane remains unchanged. Curved lipids, such as cholesterol, as well as asymmetrically included proteins and tethered sugars can, therefore, actively participate in the control of the membrane trafficking of nanoscopic cargo. We find that even a low-level expression of curved inert membrane components can determine the membrane selectivity toward the cargo size and can be used to selectively target membranes of certain compositions. Our results suggest a robust and general method of controlling cargo trafficking by adjusting the membrane composition without needing to alter the concentration of receptors or the average membrane curvature. This study indicates that cells can prepare for any trafficking event by incorporating curved inert components in either of the membrane leaflets.},

Their bending rigidity -- quantified by the persistence length --, depends crucially on Coulombic features, such as the ionic strength of the solution which offers a convenient experimental route for tuning the rigidity. While the classic Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman treatment fails for realistic parameter values, we derive a simple analytical formula for the electrostatic persistence length. It is shown to be in remarkable agreement with numerically obtained Poisson-Boltzmann theory results, thereby fully accounting for non-linearities, among which counter-ion condensation effects. Specified to double-stranded DNA, our work reveals that the widely used bare persistence length of 500$\backslash$,$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ is overestimated by some 20{\%}},

Sequence comparison of rods from skeletal, smooth and non-muscle myosin II shows that different myosin II subtypes have significantly different charge distributions. Analysis of the ionic interactions between adjacent rods with changing molecular overlap relates the different patterns of charge to the different structures of skeletal and smooth muscle myosin II filaments. It is shown in the case of skeletal muscle myosin II that the skip residues have a critical role in keeping these unique patterns of charge in perfect phase. Only one of the previously suggested packing models for myosin II filaments, with a slight modification, is supported, since it satisfies all the sequence-predicted axial shifts between adjacent rods. Such analysis significantly advances understanding of myosin filament assembly properties and will help to provide a basis for the proper understanding of myosin-associated diseases. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Strength and other mechanical properties of cement and concrete rely upon the formation of calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H) during cement hydration. Controlling structure and properties of the C-S-H phase is a challenge, due to the complexity of this hydration product and of the mechanisms that drive its precipitation from the ionic solution upon dissolution of cement grains in water. Departing from traditional models mostly focused on length scales above the micrometer, recent research addressed the molecular structure of C-S-H. However, small-angle neutron scattering, electron- microscopy imaging, and nanoindentation experiments suggest that its mesoscale organization, extending over hundreds of nanometers, may be more important. Here we unveil the C-S-H mesoscale texture, a crucial step to connect the fundamental scales to the macroscale of engineering properties. We use simulations that combine information of the nanoscale building units of C-S-H and their effective interactions, obtained from atomistic simulations and experiments, into a statistical physics framework for aggregating nanoparticles. We compute small-angle scattering intensities, pore size distributions, specific surface area, local densities, indentation modulus, and hardness of the material, providing quantitative understanding of different experimental investigations. Our results provide insight into how the heterogeneities developed during the early stages of hydration persist in the structure of C-S-H and impact the mechanical performance of the hardened cement paste. Unraveling such links in cement hydrates can be groundbreaking and controlling them can be the key to smarter mix designs of cementitious materials.},

@article{Seifert1997,
abstract = {Vesicles consisting of a bilayer membrane of amphiphilic lipid molecules are remarkably flexible surfaces that show an amazing variety of shapes of different symmetry and topology. Owing to the fluidity of the membrane, shape transitions such as budding can be induced by temperature changes or the action of optical tweezers. Thermally excited shape fluctuations are both strong and slow enough to be visible by video microscopy. Depending on the physical conditions, vesicles adhere to and unbind from each other or a substrate. This article describes the systematic physical theory developed to understand the static and dynamic aspects of membrane and vesicle configurations. The preferred shapes arise from a competition between curvature energy, which derives from the bending elasticity of the membrane, geometrical constraints such as fixed surface area and fixed enclosed volume, and a signature of the bilayer aspect. These shapes of lowest energy are arranged into phase diagrams, which separate regions of different symmetry by continuous or discontinuous transitions. The geometrical constraints affect the fluctuations around these shapes by creating an effective tension. For vesicles of non-spherical topology, the conformal invariance of the curvature energy leads to conformal diffusion, which signifies a one-fold degeneracy of the ground state. Unbinding and adhesion transitions arise from the balance between attractive interactions and entropic repulsion or a cost in bending energy, respectively. Both the dynamics of equilibrium fluctuations and the dynamics of shape transformations are governed not only by viscous damping in the surrounding liquid but also by internal friction if the two monolayers slip over each other. More complex membranes such as that of the red blood cell exhibit a variety of new phenomena because of coupling between internal degrees of freedom and external geometry. {\textcopyright} 1997 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

We contrast these strategies with processes of transformative self-assembly that use self-organizing media, reaction-diffusion systems and coupled mesophases to produce higher-level hybrid structures under non-equilibrium conditions. Key elements of the constructional codes associated with these processes are identified with regard to existing theoretical knowledge, and presented as a heuristic guideline for the rational design of hybrid nano-objects and nanomaterials. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Particular attention is given to the montmorillonite, vermiculite, and illite systems. The diffuse double-layer interactions are calculated using an advanced statistical mechanical method, the Anisotropic Hypernetted Chain approximation. In contrast to the predictions of the simple Poisson-Boltzmann theory, which is based on inadequate approximations, for divalent ions the double-layer interaction is strongly attractive at relatively small surface separations, provided the density of surface charge is reasonably large. The attraction is a consequence of the correlations between the ions, giving rise to an electrostatic fluctuation force. When the van der Waals forces between the dielectric media are included, the attraction becomes even larger. The attractive force between the Ca-clay particles gives rise to a stable state, a potential minimum. No specific binding or hydration effects involving the Ca2+ ions are needed to explain the existence of the minimum. However, the position of the potential minimum as derived using the model, based on diffuse double-layer and van der Waals forces only, is influenced by hydration interactions. Some implications of the potential minimum are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {When aqueous salt solutions contain multivalent ions (like Ca2+ or Mg2+), strong correlation effects may lead to ion-bridging, net attraction, and tight-coupling between like-charged interfaces. To examine the effects of surface charge density, temperature, salt type, and salt concentration on the structures of tightly coupled charged interfaces, we have used mixed lipid membranes, containing either saturated or unsaturated tails in the presence of multivalent ions. We discovered that tightly coupled membrane lamellar phases, dominated by attractive interactions, coexisted with weakly coupled lamellar phases, dominated by repulsive interactions. To control the membrane charge density, we mixed lipids with negatively charged headgroups, DLPS and DOPS, with their zwitterionic analogue having the same tails, DLPC and DOPC, respectively. Using solution X-ray scattering we measured the lamellar repeat distance, D, at different ion concentrations, temperatures, and membrane charge densities. The multivalent ions tightly coupled the mixed lipid bilayers whose charged lipid molar fraction was between 0.1 and 1. The repeat distance of the tightly coupled phase was about 4 nm for the DLPS/DLPC mixtures and about 5 nm for the DOPS/DOPC mixtures. In this phase, the repeat distance slightly increased with increasing temperature and decreased with increasing charge density. When the molar fraction of charged lipid was 0.1 or 0.25, a less tightly coupled phase coexisted with the tightly coupled phase. The weakly coupled lamellar phase had significantly larger D values, although they were consistently shorter than the D values in monovalent salt solutions with similar screening lengths.},

A new self-consistent theory of the correlation-hole type is proposed which leads to a modified Poisson-Boltzmann integral equation for the density profile, convenient for analytical progress and straightforward to solve numerically. The exact density profiles are recovered in the limits of weak and strong couplings. In contrast to previous theoretical attempts of the test-charge family, the density profiles fulfill the contact-value theorem at all values of the coupling constant, and exhibit the mean-field decay at asymptotically large distances from the wall, as expected. We furthermore show that the density corrections at large couplings exhibit the proper dependence on coupling parameter and distance to the charged wall. The numerical results for intermediate values of the coupling provide accurate density profiles which are in good agreement with those obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations. The crossover to mean-field behavior at large distance is studied in detail.},

abstract = {Many theoretical studies were devoted in the past to ion-specific effects trying to interpret a large body of experimental evidence, such as surface tension at air/water interfaces and force measurements between charged objects. Although several mechanisms were suggested to explain the results, such as dispersion forces and specific surface-ion interactions, we would like to suggest another source of ion-specificity originating from the local variations of the dielectric constant due to the presence of ions in the solution. We present a mean-field model to account for the heterogeneity of the dielectric constant caused by the ions. In particular, for ions that decrease the dielectric constant we find a depletion of ions from the vicinity of charged surfaces. For a two-plate system, the same effect leads to an increase of the pressure in between two surfaces. Our results suggest that the effect of ions on the local dielectric constant should be taken into account when interpreting experiments that address ion-specific effects.},

abstract = {Screening of a strongly charged macroion by multivalent counterions is considered. It is shown that coun- terions form a strongly correlated liquid at the surface of the macroion. Cohesive energy of this liquid leads to additional attraction of counterions to the surface, which is absent in conventional solutions of the Poisson- Boltzmann equation. Away from the surface this attraction can be taken into account by a new boundary condition for the concentration of counterions near the surface. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is solved with this boundary condition for a charged flat surface, a cylinder, and a sphere. In all three cases, screening is much stronger than in the conventional approach. At some critical exponentially small concentration of multivalent counterions in the solution, they totally neutralize the surface charge at small distances from the surface. At larger concentrations they invert the sign of the net macroion charge. The absolute value of the inverted charge density can be as large as 20{\%} of the bare one. In particular, for a cylindrical macroion it is shown that for screening by multivalent counterions, predictions of the Onsager-Manning theory are quantitatively incorrect. The net charge density of the cylinder is smaller than their theory predicts and inverts the sign with a growing concentration of counterions. Moreover, the condensation loses its universality and the net charge linear density depends on the bare one. ?S1063-651X?99?11311-4?},

@article{Bloomfield1991,
abstract = {DNA is generally found within viruses and cells in a tightly packaged state, typically occupying only 10(-4)-10(-6) of the volume of the uncondensed DNA wormlike coil. Condensation can be induced in vitro at low salt by the naturally occurring polyamines spermidine3+ and spermine4+, by hexammine cobalt(III), and even by Mg2+ in methanol-water mixtures. These condensates generally have an orderly, toroidal, or rodlike shape and size similar to that of DNA gently lysed from phage heads. It is also striking that the condensate size distribution is independent of DNA molecular length from 400 to 40,000 base pairs (bp), but that shorter DNA molecules (e.g., 150-bp mononucleosomal DNA) cannot condense in this fashion. We have constructed a successive association equilibrium theory to attempt to explain these results, using an equation devised by Tanford for micelle formation. Most of the obvious attractive and repulsive free energy contributions (mixing, bending, hydration, and other nearest-neighbor interactions) are linear in the amount of DNA incorporated, but the net attractive delta G0 grows nonlinearly because of the increasing average number of nearest neighbors of each duplex as the particle grows. In order that the size distribution have a maximum, a quadratic repulsive free energy is also required, arising from the electrostatic self-energy of the incompletely neutralized particles. The net attractive free energy per base pair interaction is tiny, on the order of 10(-3) kT. Despite the apparent generally correct order of magnitude of the various free energy terms, the calculated size distribution is smaller and narrower than observed experimentally. It appears that the size distribution of condensed particles is determined kinetically rather than thermodynamically. Very short DNA molecules cannot nucleate stable aggregates because they cannot develop adequate overlap, either internally or intermolecularly. A substantial fraction of rodlike condensates is observed in aqueous solutions only with a rather inefficient condensing agent, permethylated spermidine. This suggests that slow condensation kinetics may be required to overcome the high activation energy of highly distorted DNA bends or kinks at the turning points of rods. Evidence is reviewed that condensation may be associated with localized helix structure distortion provoked by condensing agents.},

abstract = {Advances in both top-down and bottom-up syntheses of a wide variety of complex colloidal building blocks and also in methods of controlling their assembly in solution have led to new and interesting forms of highly controlled soft matter. In particular, top-down lithographic methods of producing monodisperse colloids now provide precise human-designed control over their sub-particle features, opening up a wide range of new possibilities for assembly structures that had been previously limited by the range of shapes available through bottom-up methods. Moreover, an increasing level of control over anisotropic interactions between these colloidal building blocks, which can be tailored through local geometries of sub-particle features as well as site-specific surface modifications, is giving rise to new demonstrations of massively parallel off-chip self-assembly of specific target structures with low defect rates. In particular, new experimental realizations of hierarchical self-assembly and control over the chiral purity of resulting assembly structures have been achieved. Increasingly, shape-dependent, shape-complementary, and roughness-controlled depletion attractions between non-spherical colloids are being used in novel ways to create assemblies that go far beyond early examples, such as fractal clusters formed by diffusion-limited and reaction-limited aggregation of spheres. As self-assembly methods have progressed, a wide variety of advanced directed assembly methods have also been developed; approaches based on microfluidic control and applying structured electromagnetic fields are particularly promising.},

abstract = {Using light scattering and Atomic Force Microscopy techniques, we have studied the kinetics and equilibrium scattering intensity of collagen association, which is pertinent to the vitreous of the human eye. Specifically, we have characterized fibrillization dependence on pH, temperature, and ionic strength. At higher and lower pH, collagen triple helices remain stable in solution without fibrillization. At physiological pH, fibrillization occurs and the fibril growth is slowed upon either an increase in ionic strength or a decrease in temperature. The total light scattering with respect to ionic strength is non-monotonic in these conditions as a result of a competing dependence of fibril concentration and size on ionic strength. Fibril concentration is the highest at lower ionic strengths and rapidly decays for higher ionic strengths. On the other hand, fibril size is larger in solutions with higher ionic strength. We present a theoretical model, based on dipolar interactions in solutions, to describe the observed electrostatic nature of collagen assembly. At extreme pH values, either very low or very high, collagen triple helices carry a large net charge of the same sign preventing their assembly into fibrils. At intermediate pH values, fluctuations in the charge distribution of the collagen triple helices around roughly zero net charge lead to fibrillization. The growth kinetics of fibrils in this regime can be adequately described by dipolar interactions arising from charge fluctuations.},

This leads to the setting and the hardening.

It provides a short review of the experimental methods which have been used to study the adhesion and the cohesion of membranes. The direct interaction between two rigid membranes has been discussed in the chapter from a theoretical point of view. In fact, sufficiently strong fluctuations overcome the attractive part of the direct interaction and lead to unbinding or adhesion transitions between the bound and unbound states of the membranes. The effects of thermally excited fluctuations are first treated in a heuristic way. The systematic theory discusses where the renormalization of the interaction by bending undulations is described for the case of two membranes. Stacks and bunches of many membranes are considered. The renormalization of hydration forces by protrusion modes is studied in the chapter. In addition, biomembranes have many other biological functions such as signal transduction or mechanical support for polymer networks. Because of their diverse biological functions, biomembranes are composed of specific mixtures of many lipids and (amphiphilic) proteins. {\textcopyright} 1995, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We find large deviations from the standard Poisson-Boltzmann treatment of the so called double layer force for divalent counterions at high surface charge densities and at short separations. The deviations have two causes: (i) Due to the inclusion of the effect of ion-ion correlations the counterions concentrate more towards the charged wall reducing the overlap between the double layers; and (ii) correlated fluctuations in the ion clouds of the two surfaces lead to an attractive interaction of a van der Waals type. For some realistic values of the parameters the attraction overcomes the repulsive part and there is a net attractive force between similarly charged surfaces. This finding leads to a modification of our conceptual understanding of the interaction between charged particles and it shows that the DLVO theory is qualitatively deficient under some, realistic, conditions. {\textcopyright} 1984 American Institute of Physics.},

One class of such condensates is composed of two polymer species, where each consists of repeated binding sites that interact in a one-to-one fashion with the binding sites of the other polymer. Biologically-motivated modeling revealed that phase separation is suppressed by a “magic-number effect” which occurs if the two polymers can form fully-bonded small oligomers by virtue of the number of binding sites in one polymer being an integer multiple of the number of binding sites of the other. Here we use lattice-model simulations and analytical calculations to show that this magic-number effect can be greatly enhanced if one of the polymer species has a rigid shape that allows for multiple distinct bonding conformations. Moreover, if one species is rigid, the effect is robust over a much greater range of relative concentrations of the two species.},

For each of the two walls, the harmonic expansion implies an effective one-body potential at the root of all observables of interest in our Wigner strong-coupling expansion. Analytical results for the particle density profile and the pressure are in good agreement with numerical Monte Carlo data, for small as well as intermediate values of d comparable with the Wigner lattice spacing. While the strong-coupling theory is extended to the fluid regime by using the concept of a correlation hole, the Wigner calculations appear trustworthy for all electrostatic couplings investigated.

The bodies assemble via a combination of liquid-liquid phase separation and gelation.

Here, we put forward a simple thermodynamic framework to describe the emergence of spatially organized droplets in multicomponent systems comprising of linear multivalent polymers also known as associative polymers. These polymers, which mimic proteins and/or RNA have the architecture of domains or motifs known as stickers that are interspersed by flexible spacers known as linkers. Using a minimalist numerical model for a four-component system, we have identified features of linear multivalent molecules that are necessary and sufficient for generating spatially organized droplets. We show that differences in sequence-specific effective solvation volumes of disordered linkers between interaction domains enable the formation of spatially organized droplets. Molecules with linkers that are preferentially solvated are driven to the interface with the bulk solvent, whereas molecules that have linkers with negligible effective solvation volumes form cores in the core-shell architectures that emerge in the minimalist four-component systems.

We discuss how the valence of stickers impacts the driving forces for condensate formation and elaborate on how stickers can be distinguished from spacers in different contexts.

abstract = {Approximately 30{\%}–40{\%} of global CO2 fixation occurs inside a non-membrane-bound organelle called the pyrenoid, which is found within the chloroplasts of most eukaryotic algae. The pyrenoid matrix is densely packed with the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco and is thought to be a crystalline or amorphous solid. Here, we show that the pyrenoid matrix of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is not crystalline but behaves as a liquid that dissolves and condenses during cell division. Furthermore, we show that new pyrenoids are formed both by fission and de novo assembly. Our modeling predicts the existence of a “magic number” effect associated with special, highly stable heterocomplexes that influences phase separation in liquid-like organelles. This view of the pyrenoid matrix as a phase-separated compartment provides a paradigm for understanding its structure, biogenesis, and regulation. More broadly, our findings expand our understanding of the principles that govern the architecture and inheritance of liquid-like organelles.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of collagen are used to investigate at the atomistic level the nature of the interprotein interactions that are present within a collagen fibril, and which are responsible for the fibril's thermodynamic stability. Simulations both of a collagen fibril and of a fully solvated tropocollagen are compared in order to study the interactions that arise between the proteins upon the process of fibrillogenesis. The interactions studied include direct interprotein hydrogen bonds, water-mediated interprotein hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. The simulations are used to quantify the number of interprotein interactions; to study which functional groups contribute most towards the interactions; and to investigate the spatial distribution of interprotein interactions throughout the fibril's D period. The processes of collagen fibrillogenesis and protein folding are then compared with each other, because these two physical processes share many similarities in concept, but the latter has been studied more widely. Molecular dynamics simulations of a bacteriophage T4 lysozyme protein, both in its native state and in an unfolded state, are used as an illustrative example of a typical protein folding process, for direct comparison with the collagen simulations. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.},

abstract = {Using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at constant water chemical potential in combination with basic theoretical arguments, we study hydration-induced interactions between two overall charge-neutral yet polar planar surfaces with different wetting properties. Whether the water film between the two surfaces becomes unstable below a threshold separation and cavitation gives rise to long-range attraction, depends on the sum of the two individual surface contact angles. Consequently, cavitation-induced attraction also occurs for a mildly hydrophilic surface interacting with a very hydrophobic surface. If both surfaces are very hydrophilic, hydration repulsion dominates at small separations and direct attractive force contribution can—if strong enough—give rise to wet adhesion in this case. In between the regimes of cavitation-induced attraction and hydration repulsion we find a narrow range of contact angle combinations where the surfaces adhere at contact in the absence of cavitation. This dry adhesion regime is driven by direct surface–surface interactions. We derive simple laws for the cavitation transition as well as for the transition between hydration repulsion and dry adhesion, which favorably compare with simulation results in a generic adhesion state diagram as a function of the two surface contact angles.},

B, 2010, 114, 12629-12631), previously validated against experimental data for a number of bulk properties, is used in molecular dynamics simulations of two different interfaces involving the ionic liquid [BMI][PF(6)]. First, simulations of the liquid-vapor interface demonstrate that the model is able to predict the surface tension of the fluid (for which we obtain a value of 39.4 mN.m(-1) at 400 K). Second, simulations were performed at constant potential differences applied between two graphite electrodes. From simulations with different applied potentials, the differential capacitances of the positive and negative electrodes can be calculated. It appears that both capacitances (C(+) = 3.9 mu F.cm(-2) for the positive electrode and C(-) = 4.8 mu F.cm(-2) for the negative electrode) agree very well with simulations results obtained with an all-atom model. The coarse-grained model also accurately reproduces the two-dimensional structure observed at the graphite-ionic liquid interface, namely, a defective hexagonal lattice with a lattice spacing of approximately 10 angstrom.},

Here, we reconstituted in vitro the ESCRT-III complex onto membranes. We show that based on variable affinities between ESCRT-III proteins and the ATPase Vps4, subunits are recruited to the membrane in a Vps4-driven sequence that starts with Snf7 and ends with Did2 and Ist1 which, together, form a fission-active subcomplex. Sequential recruitment of ESCRT-III subunits is coupled to membrane remodeling. Binding of Did2 promoted the formation of membrane protrusions which later constricted and underwent fission mediated by the recruitment of Ist1. Overall, our results provide a mechanism to explain how a sequence of ESCRT-III subunits drives membrane deformation and fission.},

We argue that nonstandard protocols are needed to realistically model collagen proteins, which in their biological state aggregate to form collagen fibrils, and so should not be treated as fully solvated molecules. A new modeling approach is presented that can account for the local environment of collagen molecules within a fibril and which therefore simulates aspects of their behavior that would not otherwise be distinguished. This modeling approach exploits periodic boundaries to replicate the supermolecular arrangement of collagen proteins within the fibril, in an approach that is more commonly associated with modeling crystalline solids rather than mesoscopic protein aggregates. Initial simulations show agreement with experimental observations and corroborate theories of the fibril's structure. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Biological mixtures such as the cytosol may consist of thousands of distinct components. There is now a substantial body of evidence showing that, under physiological conditions, intracellular mixtures can phase separate into spatially distinct regions with differing compositions. In this article we present numerical evidence indicating that such spontaneous compartmentalization exploits general features of the phase diagram of a multicomponent biomolecular mixture. In particular, we show that demixed domains are likely to segregate when the variance in the intermolecular interaction strengths exceeds a well-defined threshold. Multiple distinct phases are likely to become stable under very similar conditions, which can then be tuned to achieve multiphase coexistence. As a result, only minor adjustments to the composition of the cytosol or the strengths of the intermolecular interactions are needed to regulate the formation of different domains with specific compositions, implying that phase separation is a robust mechanism for creating spatial organization. We further predict that this functionality is only weakly affected by increasing the number of components in the system. Our model therefore suggests that, for purely physico-chemical reasons, biological mixtures are naturally poised to undergo a small number of demixing phase transitions.},

Here, we explore formation of prototypical MOs from multivalent proteins on various time and length scales and show that the kinetically arrested metastable multidroplet state is a dynamic outcome of the interplay between two competing processes: a diffusionlimited encounter between proteins, and the exhaustion of available valencies within smaller clusters. Clusters with satisfied valencies cannot coalesce readily, resulting in metastable, longliving droplets. In the regime of dense clusters akin to phase-separation, we observe co-existing assemblies, in contrast to the single, large equilibrium-like cluster. A system-spanning network encompassing all multivalent proteins was only observed at high concentrations and large interaction valencies. In the regime favoring large clusters, we observe a slow-down in the dynamics of the condensed phase, potentially resulting in loss of function. Therefore, metastability could be a hallmark of dynamic functional droplets formed by sticker-spacer proteins.},

abstract = {Strong, short-ranged positional correlations involving counterions can induce a net attractive force between negatively charged strands of DNA and lead to the formation of ion pairs in dilute ionic solutions. However, the long range of the Coulomb interactions impedes the development of a simple local picture. We address this general problem by mapping the properties of a nonuniform system with Coulomb interactions onto those of a simpler system with short-ranged intermolecular interactions in an effective external field that accounts for the averaged effects of appropriately chosen long-ranged and slowly varying components of the Coulomb interactions. The remaining short-ranged components combine with the other molecular core interactions and strongly affect pair correlations in dense or strongly coupled systems. We show that pair correlation functions in the effective short-ranged system closely resemble those in the uniform primitive model of ionic solutions and illustrate the formation of ion pairs and clusters at low densities. The theory accurately describes detailed features of the effective attraction between two equally charged walls at strong coupling and intermediate separations of the walls. Analytical results for the minimal coupling strength needed to get any attraction and for the separation at which the attractive force is a maximum are presented.},

For ternary mixtures, we find up to eight fundamentally different percolated states. The states differ in terms of the species and pairs of species that have percolated. The strongest gel is a trigel or tricontinuous gel, in which each of the three species has percolated. The weakest gel is a mixed gel in which all of the particles have percolated, but none of the species percolates by itself. The competition between entropy of mixing and internal energy of bonding determines the stability of each state. Theoretical and simulation results are in very good agreement. The only significant difference is the temperature at the percolation threshold, which is overestimated by the theory due to the absence of correlations between bonds in the theoretical description.},

From cytoplasmic organisation inside a cell to the collective migration of cell tissue during organismal development and wound healing, phase transitions have emerged as key mechanisms underlying many crucial biological processes. However, a living system is fundamentally different from a thermal system, with driven chemical reactions (e.g. metabolism) and motility being two hallmarks of its non-equilibrium nature. In this review, we will discuss how driven chemical reactions can arrest universal coarsening kinetics expected from thermal phase separation, and how motility leads to the emergence of a novel universality class when the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken in an incompressible fluid.},

abstract = {Multivalent ligands can function as inhibitors or effectors of biological processes. Potent inhibitory activity can arise from the high functional affinities of multivalent ligand-receptor interactions. Effector functions, however, are influenced not only by apparent affinities but also by alternate factors, including the ability of a ligand to cluster receptors. Little is known about the molecular features of a multivalent ligand that determine whether it will function as an inhibitor or effector. We envisioned that, by altering multivalent ligand architecture, ligands with preferences for different binding mechanisms would be generated. To this end, a series of 28 ligands possessing structural diversity was synthesized. This series provides the means to explore the effects of ligand architecture on the inhibition and clustering of a model protein, the lectin concanavalin A (Con A). The structural parameters that were varied include scaffold shape, size, valency, and density of binding elements. We found that ligands with certain architectures are effective inhibitors, but others mediate receptor clustering. Specifically, high molecular weight, polydisperse polyvalent ligands are effective inhibitors of Con A binding, whereas linear oligomeric ligands generated by the ring-opening metathesis polymerization have structural properties that favor clustering. The shape of a multivalent ligand also influences specific aspects of receptor clustering. These include the rate at which the receptor is clustered, the number of receptors in the clusters, and the average interreceptor distance. Our results indicate that the architecture of a multivalent ligand is a key parameter in determining its activity as an inhibitor or effector. Diversity-oriented syntheses of multivalent ligands coupled with effective assays that can be used to compare the contributions of different binding parameters may afford ligands that function by specific mechanisms.},

abstract = {The linker for activation of T cells (LAT), the linker for activation of B cells (LAB), and the linker for activation of X cells (LAX) form a family of transmembrane adaptor proteins widely expressed in lymphocytes. These scaffolding proteins have multiple binding motifs that, when phosphorylated, bind the SH2 domain of the cytosolic adaptor Grb2. Thus, the valence of LAT, LAB and LAX for Grb2 is variable, depending on the strength of receptor activation that initiates phosphorylation. During signaling, the LAT population will exhibit a time-varying distribution of Grb2 valences from zero to three. In the cytosol, Grb2 forms 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS1. The 2:1 complex can bridge two LAT molecules when each Grb2, through their SH2 domains, binds to a phosphorylated site on a separate LAT. In T cells and mast cells, after receptor engagement, receptor phosphoyrlation is rapidly followed by LAT phosphorylation and aggregation. In mast cells, aggregates containing more than one hundred LAT molecules have been detected. Previously we considered a homogeneous population of trivalent LAT molecules and showed that for a range of Grb2, SOS1 and LAT concentrations, an equilibrium theory for LAT aggregation predicts the formation of a gel-like phase comprising a very large aggregate (superaggregate). We now extend this theory to investigate the effects of a distribution of Grb2 valence in the LAT population on the formation of LAT aggregates and superaggregate and use stochastic simulations to calculate the fraction of the total LAT population in the superaggregate. {\textcopyright} 2012 This is an open-access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

abstract = {The fate of chemical and radioactive wastes in the environment is related to the ability of natural phases to attenuate and immobilize contaminants through chemical sorption and precipitation processes. Our understanding of these complex processes at the atomic level is provided by a few experimental and analytical methods such as X-ray absorption and NMR spectroscopies. However, due to complexities in the structure and composition of clay and other hydrated minerals, and the inherent uncertainties of the experimental methods, it is important to apply theoretical molecular models for a fundamental atomic-level understanding, interpretation, and prediction of these phenomena. In this effort, we have developed a general force field, CLAYFF, suitable for the simulation of hydrated and multicomponent mineral systems and their interfaces with aqueous solutions. Interatomic potentials were derived from parametrizations incorporating structural and spectroscopic data for a variety of simple hydrated compounds. A flexible SPC-based water model is used to describe the water and hydroxyl behavior. Metal-oxygen interactions are described by a Lennard-Jones function and a Coulombic term with partial charges derived by Mulliken and ESP analysis of DFT results. Bulk structures, relaxed surface structures, and intercalation processes are evaluated and compared to experimental and spectroscopic findings for validation. Our approach differs from most others in that we treat most interatomic interactions as nonbonded. This allows us to effectively use the force field for a wide variety of phases and to properly account for energy and momentum transfer between the fluid phase and the solid, while keeping the number of parameters small enough to allow modeling of relatively large and highly disordered systems. Simulations of clay, hydroxide, and oxyhydroxide phases and their interfaces with aqueous solutions combine energy minimization and molecular dynamics methods to describe the structure and behavior of water, hydroxyl, surface species, and intercalates in these systems. The results obtained to date demonstrate that CLAYFF shows good promise to evolve into a widely adaptable and broadly effective force field for molecular simulations of fluid interfaces with clays and other clay-related phases, as well as other inorganic materials characterized by complex, disordered, and often ill-determined structure and composition.},

abstract = {Adhesion and engulfment by the membrane are key steps in the endocytosis and exocytosis of nanoparticles by cells, which are the main pathways for transport in and out of the cell. An understanding of particle engulfment is thus essential for many applications such as biomedical imaging and drug delivery, as well as studies of nanotoxicity and viral infection. The engulfment process is governed by a competition between particle-membrane adhesion and membrane bending, and can take place not only in living cells, but also spontaneously in simple model systems consisting of lipid or polymer vesicles in contact with nano- or micron-sized particles. In this chapter, we will present the main theoretical tools and results needed to describe the engulfment of particles by vesicles or ceslls. The particles may have uniform or Janus-like (patchy) surfaces with varying adhesiveness. The membrane may have complex properties, such as nonzero bilayer asymmetry or a non-uniform curvature along its surface. Depending on the local curvature and the asymmetry of the membrane, particles may remain free, or get partially or completely engulfed. In the presence of non-uniform curvature, particles may also experience curvature-induced forces towards regions of lower or higher membrane curvature. Lastly, we also include the possibility of adhesion-induced segregation of membrane components, as in the case of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and show that the nonmonotonic size-dependence of nanoparticle endocytosis observed in experiments can be explained in this way.},

abstract = {Ligand-induced receptor aggregation is a well-known mechanism for initiating intracellular signals but oligomerization of distal signaling molecules may also be required for signal propagation. Formation of complexes containing oligomers of the transmembrane adaptor protein, linker for the activation of T cells (LAT), has been identified as critical in mast cell and T cell activation mediated by immune response receptors. Cross-linking of LAT arises from the formation of a 2:1 complex between the adaptor Grb2 and the nucleotide exchange factor SOS1, which bridges two LAT molecules through the interaction of the Grb2 SH2 domain with a phosphotyrosine on LAT. We model this oligomerization and find that the valence of LAT for Grb2, which ranges from zero to three, is critical in determining the nature and extent of aggregation. A dramatic rise in oligomerization can occur when the valence switches from two to three. For valence three, an equilibrium theory predicts the possibility of forming a gel-like phase. This prediction is confirmed by stochastic simulations, which make additional predictions about the size of the gel and the kinetics of LAT oligomerization. We discuss the model predictions in light of recent experiments on RBL-2H3 and Jurkat E6.1 cells and suggest that the gel phase has been observed in activated mast cells. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Ion transporters in Nature exhibit a wealth of complex transport properties such as voltage gating, activation, and mechanosensitive behavior. When combined, such processes result in advanced ionic machines achieving active ion transport, high selectivity, or signal processing. On the artificial side, there has been much recent progress in the design and study of transport in ionic channels, but mimicking the advanced functionalities of ion transporters remains as yet out of reach. A prerequisite is the development of ionic responses sensitive to external stimuli. In the present work, we report a counterintuitive and highly nonlinear coupling between electric and pressure-driven transport in a conical nanopore, manifesting as a strong pressure dependence of the ionic conductance. This result is at odds with standard linear response theory and is akin to a mechanical transistor functionality. We fully rationalize this behavior on the basis of the coupled electrohydrodynamics in the conical pore by extending the Poisson–Nernst–Planck–Stokes framework. The model is shown to capture the subtle mechanical balance occurring within an extended spatially charged zone in the nanopore. The pronounced sensitivity to mechanical forcing offers leads in tuning ion transport by mechanical stimuli. The results presented here provide a promising avenue for the design of tailored membrane functionalities.},

abstract = {Highly charged macroion surfaces in solutions of multivalent electrolytes attract each other electrostatically through correlations in their counterion environment. We show that significant correlation occurs when the counterion distribution has a pseudo-two-dimensional character. This allows us to treat the electrostatic correlation attraction semianalytically by reducing the problem to interaction between layers of adsorbed but mobile counterions neutralizing surfaces of similar charge density. Both when the counterion distribution is in the two-dimensional limit, and when it has a more realistic three-dimensional character, Coulomb repulsion between counterions produces an alternation of positive and negative charges at the surface. Two such apposing patterns adjust complementarily to each other, resulting in electrostatic attraction of the surfaces. The magnitude of this attraction depends solely on the surface charge density and the solution dielectric constant, while its range is defined by the size of the planar correlation hole around each ion. The attraction is stable with respect to the disruptive influence of planar thermal motion of the ions. The theory enables construction of a universal function which, after being scaled with the appropriate parameters of the system, yields the attractive electrostatic correlation pressure. {\textcopyright} 1996 American Chemical Society.},

Near an infinite planar surface this model produces the exact density profile in the limits of weak and strong coupling, which correspond to zero and infinite values of the dimensionless coupling parameter. At intermediate values of the coupling parameter our approach leads to approximate density profiles that agree qualitatively with Monte-Carlo simulation. For large values of the coupling parameter our model predicts a crossover from exponential to algebraic decay at large distance from the charged plate. Based on the test charge approach we argue that the exact density profile is described, in this regime, by a modified mean field equation, which takes into account the interaction of an ion with the ions close to the charged plate.},

abstract = {Biomolecular condensates form via phase transitions that combine phase separation or demixing and networking of key protein and RNA molecules. Proteins that drive condensate formation are either linear or branched multivalent proteins where multivalence refers to the presence of multiple protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interaction domains or motifs within a protein. Recent work has shown that multivalent protein drivers of phase transitions are in fact biological instantiations of associative polymers. Such systems can be characterized by stickers-and-spacers architectures where stickers contribute to system-specific spatial hierarchies of directional interactions and spacers control the concentration-dependent inhomogeneities in densities of stickers around one another. The collective effects of interactions among stickers and spacers lead to the emergence of dense droplet phases wherein the stickers form percolated networks of polymers. To enable the calculation of system-specific phase diagrams of multivalent proteins, we have developed LASSI (LAttice simulations of Sticker and Spacer Interactions), which is an efficient open source computational engine for lattice-based polymer simulations built on the stickers and spacers framework. In LASSI, a specific multivalent protein architecture is mapped into a set of beads on the 3-dimensional lattice space with proper coarse-graining, and specific sticker-sticker interactions are modeled as pairwise anisotropic interactions. For efficient and broad search of the conformational ensemble, LASSI uses Monte Carlo methods, and we optimized the move set so that LASSI can handle both dilute and dense systems. Also, we developed quantitative measures to extract phase boundaries from LASSI simulations, using known and hidden collective parameters. We demonstrate the application of LASSI to two known archetypes of linear and branched multivalent proteins. The simulations recapitulate observations from experiments and importantly, they generate novel quantitative insights that augment what can be gleaned from experiments alone. We conclude with a discussion of the advantages of lattice-based approaches such as LASSI and highlight the types of systems across which this engine can be deployed, either to make predictions or to enable the design of novel condensates.Author Summary Spatial and temporal organization of molecular matter is a defining hallmark of cellular ultrastructure and recent attention has focused intensely on organization afforded by membraneless organelles, which are referred to as biomolecular condensates. These condensates form via phase transitions that combine phase separation and networking of condensate-specific protein and nucleic acid molecules. Several questions remain unanswered regarding the driving forces for condensate formation encoded in the architectures of multivalent proteins, the molecular determinants of material properties of condensates, and the determinants of compositional specificity of condensates. Building on recently recognized analogies between associative polymers and multivalent proteins, we have developed and deployed LASSI, an open source computational engine that enables the calculation of system-specific phase diagrams for multivalent proteins. LASSI relies on a priori identification of stickers and spacers within a multivalent protein and mapping the stickers onto a 3-dimensional lattice. A Monte Carlo engine that incorporates a suite of novel and established move sets enables simulations that track density inhomogeneities and changes to the extent of networking among stickers as a function of protein concentration and interaction strengths. Calculation of distribution functions and other nonconserved order parameters allow us to compute full phase diagrams for multivalent proteins modeled using a stickers-and-spacers representation on simple cubic lattices. These predictions are shown to be system-specific and allow us to rationalize experimental observations while also enabling the design of systems with bespoke phase behavior. LASSI can be deployed to study the phase behavior of multicomponent systems, which allows us to make direct contact with cellular biomolecular condensates that are in fact multicomponent systems.},

The coiled-coil tail domain of the myosin II heavy chain mediates filament assembly, although the mechanism is poorly understood. Tail domains contain an alternating electrostatic repeat, yet only a small region of the tail (termed the "assembly domain") is typically required for assembly. Using computational analysis, mutagenesis, and electron microscopy we discovered that the assembly domain does not function through self-interaction as previously thought. Rather, the assembly domain acts as a unique, positively charged interaction surface that can stably contact multiple complementary, negatively charged surfaces in the upstream tail domain. The relative affinities of the assembly domain to each complementary interaction surface sets the characteristic molecular staggers observed in myosin II filaments. Together these results explain the relationship between the charge repeat and assembly domain in stabilizing myosin bipolar filaments.},

We construct an optimal set of local interactions for eight colloidal particles (coated, e.g., with DNA strands) to assemble into a particular polytetrahedral cluster. Maximum yield is attained when the interactions between the colloids follow the design rules: All energetically favorable interactions have the same strength, as do all unfavorable ones, and the number of components and energies fall within the proposed range. In general, it might be necessary to use more component than strictly required for enforcing the ground state configuration.

abstract = {The atomic structures of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and calcium (-sodium) aluminosilicate hydrate (C-(N)-A-S-H) gels, and their presence in conventional and blended cement systems, have been the topic of significant debate over recent decades. Previous investigations have revealed that synthetic C-S-H gel is nanocrystalline and due to the chemical similarities between ordinary Portland cement (OPC)-based systems and low-CO2 alkali-activated slags, researchers have inferred that the atomic ordering in alkali-activated slag is the same as in OPC-slag cements. Here, X-ray total scattering is used to determine the local bonding environment and nanostructure of C(-A)-S-H gels present in hydrated tricalcium silicate (C3S), blended C3S-slag and alkali-activated slag, revealing the large intrinsic differences in the extent of nanoscale ordering between C-S-H derived from C3S and alkali-activated slag systems, which may have a significant influence on thermodynamic stability, and material properties at higher length scales, including long term durability of alkali-activated cements.},

We focus on receptors and proteases in prompting entry and highlight the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) known to activate several virus fusion proteins. These and other proteases are essential cofactors permitting coronavirus infection, conceivably being in proximity to cell-surface receptors and thus poised to split entering spike proteins into the fragments that refold to mediate membrane fusion.

abstract = {Face-to-face and edge-to-edge free energy interactions of Wyoming Na-montmorillonite platelets were studied by calculating potential of mean force along their center to center reaction coordinate using explicit solvent (i.e., water) molecular dynamics and free energy perturbation methods. Using a series of configurations, the Gay-Berne potential was parametrized and used to examine the meso-scale aggregation and properties of platelets that are initially random oriented under isothermal-isobaric conditions. Aggregates of clay were defined by geometrical analysis of face-to-face proximity of platelets with size distribution described by a log-normal function. The isotropy of the microstructure was assessed by computing a scalar order parameter. The number of platelets per aggregate and anisotropy of the microstructure both increases with platelet plan area. The system becomes more ordered and aggregate size increases with increasing pressure until maximum ordered state at confining pressure of 50 atm. Further increase of pressure slides platelets relative to each other leading to smaller aggregate size. The results show aggregate size of (3–8) platelets for sodium-smectite in agreement with experiments (3–10). The geometrical arrangement of aggregates affects mechanical properties of the system. The elastic properties of the meso-scale aggregate assembly are reported and compared with nanoindentation experiments. It is found that the elastic properties at this scale are close to the cubic systems. The elastic stiffness and anisotropy of the assembly increases with the size of the platelets and the level of external pressure.},

abstract = {Attraction between like-charged macroions is fundamental to many processes in biology, chemistry, and physics. It also plays an important role in industrial applications such as ion-extraction processes or catalysis. In this work, we report a novel mechanism by which attraction can be realized between spherical macroions at high ionic strength. It consists of specific configurations of two, three, and more counterions that appear between macroions with high statistical probability. The attraction is manifested in a minimum in the potential of mean force between the macroions at short distances. Its depth increases with increasing charge of the macroion, demonstrating that the attraction is electrostatic in nature. It is shown that the implicit solvent model with a distance-dependent dielectric constant can capture both the geometry and thermodynamics of charge-stabilized macroion dimers on the qualitative level. The results obtained for a model colloid with a smooth surface are extrapolated to more realistic systems. Evidence is found that the reported mechanism can be observed in small chemical compounds with encapsulated ions such as fullerenes.},

For the intermediate case of trivalent particles, we show that a cluster phase is present over a wide range of concentrations and interaction energies. The clusters are polydisperse in size, have a fractal dimension of 1.5, and tend to fully saturate their bonds at high interaction energies. The number of unformed bonds scales linearly with the number of particles in a cluster, which implies the absence of phase transition in the explored region of interaction energies and concentrations. We discuss possible implications of our model for membrane protein clustering. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We study the effective interaction between differently charged polyelectrolyte-colloid complexes in electrolyte solutions via Monte Carlo simulations. These complexes are formed when short and flexible polyelectrolyte chains adsorb onto oppositely charged colloidal spheres, dispersed in an electrolyte solution. In our simulations the bending energy between adjacent monomers is small compared to the electrostatic energy, and the chains, once adsorbed, do not exchange with the solution, although they rearrange on the particles surface to accommodate further adsorbing chains or due to the electrostatic interaction with neighbor complexes. Rather unexpectedly, when two interacting particles approach each other, the rearrangement of the surface charge distribution invariably produces antiparallel dipolar doublets that invert their orientation at the isoelectric point. These findings clearly rule out a contribution of dipole-dipole interactions to the observed attractive interaction between the complexes, pointing out that such suspensions cannot be considered dipolar fluids. On varying the ionic strength of the electrolyte, we find that a screening length $\kappa$-1, short compared with the size of the colloidal particles, is required in order to observe the attraction between like-charged complexes due to the nonuniform distribution of the electric charge on their surface ("patch attraction"). On the other hand, by changing the polyelectrolyte/particle charge ratio E s, the interaction between like-charged polyelectrolyte-decorated particles, at short separations, evolves from purely repulsive to strongly attractive. Hence, the effective interaction between the complexes is characterized by a potential barrier, whose height depends on the net charge and on the nonuniformity of their surface charge distribution. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

We show that to observe Warburg-like impedance the diffusion coefficient of the positive ions has to differ from that of the negative ones, and furthermore the electrodes have to be not blocking. We assume that the non-blocking properties of the electrodes can be described by means of an Ohmic model, where the charge exchange between the cell and the external circuit is described by means of an electrode conductivity. For simplicity we consider a symmetric cell. However, our analysis can be easily generalized to more complicated situations, where the cell is not symmetric and the charge exchange is described by the Chang-Jaffe model, or by a linearized version of the Butler-Volmer equation. Our analysis allows justification of the expression for Warburg's impedance proposed previously by several groups, based on wrong assumptions.},

abstract = {Recent experiments with super-resolution live cell microscopy revealed that nonmuscle myosin II minifilaments are much more dynamic than formerly appreciated, often showing plastic processes such as splitting, concatenation and stacking. Here we combine sequence information, electrostatics and elasticity theory to demonstrate that the parallel staggers at 14.3, 43.2 and 72 nm have a strong tendency to splay their heads away from the minifilament, thus potentially initiating the diverse processes seen in live cells. In contrast, the straight antiparallel stagger with an overlap of 43 nm is very stable and likely initiates minifilament nucleation. Using stochastic dynamics in a newly defined energy landscape, we predict that the optimal parallel staggers between the myosin rods are obtained by a trial-and-error process in which two rods attach and re-attach at different staggers by rolling and zipping motion. The experimentally observed staggers emerge as the configurations with the largest contact times. We find that contact times increase from isoforms C to B to A, that A-B-heterodimers are surprisingly stable and that myosin 18A should incorporate into mixed filaments with a small stagger. Our findings suggest that nonmuscle myosin II minifilaments in the cell are first formed by isoform A and then convert to mixed A-B-filaments, as observed experimentally.},

abstract = {In a collection of assembling particles that is allowed to reach thermal equilibrium, the energy of a given microscopic arrangement and the probability of observing the system in that arrangement obey a simple exponential relationship known as the Boltzmann distribution. Once the same thermally fluctuating particles are driven away from equilibrium by forces that do work on the system over time, however, it becomes significantly more challenging to relate the likelihood of a given outcome to familiar thermodynamic quantities. Nonetheless, it has long been appreciated that developing a sound and general understanding of the thermodynamics of such non-equilibrium scenarios could ultimately enable us to control and imitate the marvellous successes that living things achieve in driven self-assembly. Here, I suggest that such a theoretical understanding may at last be emerging, and trace its development from historic first steps to more recent discoveries. Focusing on these newer results, I propose that they imply a general thermodynamic mechanism for self-organization via dissipation of absorbed work that may be applicable in a broad class of driven many-body systems.},

Here we assemble a large variety of available datasets, prioritising official data and emission factors, including estimates submitted to the UNFCCC plus new estimates for China and India, to present a new analysis of global process emissions from cement production.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}To mount an immune response, T cells must first find rare antigens present at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). They achieve this by migrating rapidly through the crowded space of tissues and constantly sampling the surface of APCs. Upon antigen recognition, T cells decelerate and polarize towards the APC, ultimately forming a specialized interface known as the immunological synapse. These conjugates form as the result of the interaction between pairs of receptors/ligands that are under mechanical stress due to the continuously reorganizing cell cytoskeleton. In this review, we discuss the involvement of mechanical forces during antigen recognition by migrating T cells. We will explore this question from a conceptual and technical perspective, with the aim of providing new insights into the emerging field of mechanobiology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

@article{Huang1986,
abstract = {The deformation free energy of a lipid bilayer is presented based on the principle of a continuum theory. For small deformations, the free energy consists of a layer-compression term, a splay-distortion term, and a surface-tension term, equivalent to the elastic free energy of a two-layer smectic liquid crystal with surface tension. Minimization of the free energy leads to a differential equation that, with boundary conditions, determines the elastic deformation of a bilayer membrane. When a dimeric gramicidin channel is formed in a membrane of thickness greater than the length of the channel, the membrane deformation reduces the stability of the channel. Previously this effect was studied by comparing the variation of channel lifetime with the surface tension of bilayers (Elliott, J. R., D. Needham, J. P. Dilger, and D. A. Hayden, 1983, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 735:95–103). The tension was assumed to pull a dimer for a distance z before the channel loses ion conductivity. To account for the data, z was found to be 18 A. With the deformation free energy, the data can be accounted for with z less than or approximately to 1 A, which is consistent with the breaking of hydrogen bonds in a dimer dissociation. Increasing the strength of lipid-protein interactions is not the only consequence of the complete free energy compared with the previous discussions. It also changes the shape of membrane deformation around an embedded channel from convex to concave, and increases the range of deformation from less than 10 A to greater than 20 A. Clearly these will be important factors in the general considerations of lipid-protein interactions and membrane-mediated interactions between proteins. In addition, thermal fluctuations of a membrane are calculated; in particular, we calculate the relations between the intrinsic thickness and the experimentally measured values. The experimental parameters of monoolein-squalene membranes are used for quantitative analyses. {\textcopyright} 1986, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

@article{Hossein2020,
abstract = {Lipid bilayers can exhibit asymmetric states, in which the physical characteristics of one leaflet differ from those of the other. This most visibly manifests in a different lipid composition, but it can also involve opposing lateral stresses in each leaflet that combine to an overall vanishing membrane tension. Here, we use theoretical modeling and coarse-grained simulation to explore the interplay between a compositional asymmetry and a nonvanishing differential stress. Minimizing the total elastic energy leads to a preferred spontaneous curvature that balances torques due to both bending moments and differential stress, with sometimes unexpected consequences. For instance, asymmetric flat bilayers, whose specific areas in each leaflet are matched to those of corresponding tensionless symmetric flat membranes, still exhibit a residual differential stress because the conditions of vanishing area strain and vanishing bending moment differ. We also measure the curvature rigidity of asymmetric bilayers and find that a sufficiently strong differential stress, but not compositional asymmetry alone, can increase the bending modulus. The likely cause is a stiffening of the compressed leaflet, which appears to be related to its gel transition but not identical with it. We finally show that the impact of cholesterol on differential stress depends on the relative strength of elastic and thermodynamic driving forces: if cholesterol solvates equally well in both leaflets, it will redistribute to cancel both leaflet tensions almost completely, but if its partitioning free energy prefers one leaflet over the other, the resulting distribution bias may even create differential stress. Because cells keep most of their lipid bilayers in an asymmetric nonequilibrium steady state, our findings suggest that biomembranes are elastically more complex than previously thought: besides a spontaneous curvature, they might also exhibit significant differential stress, which could strongly affect their curvature energetics.},

Examples can be found in very diverse areas with the setting of cement paste as one extreme and the compactation of DNA as another.

This typically takes place in the presence of multivalent counterions and/or in solutions with low dielectric permittivity. The attractive forces are driven by the energy while the repulsive are mainly of entropic origin, and the final outcome is a delicate balance of these contributions. Here we present two simple models, which give a conceptually simple description of this balance. {\textcopyright} Taylor and Francis Inc.},

Their structural disorder, evidenced by the diffuseness of the reflections with k odd, has been dealt with through an OD approach, which allowed us to derive a reliable model of the structure, to define the two main polytypes (MDO structures), which were subsequently refined, revealing the distinctive structural details of the two specimens. The MDO1 polytype of tobermorite 11{\AA} from Wessels mine [orthorhombic, space group F2dd, a = 11.265(2), b = 7.386(1), c = 44.970(9) {\AA}] was refined to R = 0.128, whereas the refinement carried on the MDO2 polytype [monoclinic, space group B11m, a = 6.735(2), b = 7.385(1), c = 22.487(4) {\AA}, $\Upsilon$ = 123.25(1)°] converged to R = 0.051. Two refinements were carried out for the MDO2 polytype of the specimen from the Urals [space group B11m, a = 6.732(2), b = 7.368(1), c = 22.680(4) {\AA}, $\Upsilon$ = 123. 18(1)°] with data collected with conventional source (R = 0.089) and with synchrotron radiation (R = 0.110). Common structural features are the infinite layers of calcium polyhedra, parallel to (001), with tetrahedral chains of wollastonite-type running along b and attached on both sides of these layers. The composite layers are stacked along c and connected through formation of double tetrahedral chains, with 'ideal' composition [Si6O15(OH)2] and [Si6O16(OH)] in the specimens from Wessels mine and Urals respectively. The most distinctive feature of the two specimens is the content of the structural cavities: whereas only water molecules were found in the specimen from Wessels mine, 'zeolitic' calcium cations and water molecules were found in that from Urals. These structural aspects are compared and their relevance in explaining the different thermal behaviour of the two types of tobermorite 11{\AA} is indicated.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, the ability to reduce the dimensions of fluidic devices to the nanometre scale (by using nanotubes1–5 or nanopores6–11, for example) has led to the discovery of unexpected water- and ion-transport phenomena12–14. More recently, van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional materials15 has allowed the creation of artificial channels with {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m-scale precision16. Such channels push fluid confinement to the molecular scale, wherein the limits of continuum transport equations17 are challenged. Water films on this scale can rearrange into one or two layers with strongly suppressed dielectric permittivity18,19 or form a room-temperature ice phase20. Ionic motion in such confined channels21 is affected by direct interactions between the channel walls and the hydration shells of the ions, and water transport becomes strongly dependent on the channel wall material22. We explore how water and ionic transport are coupled in such confinement. Here we report measurements of ionic fluid transport through molecular-sized slit-like channels. The transport, driven by pressure and by an applied electric field, reveals a transistor-like electrohydrodynamic effect. An applied bias of a fraction of a volt increases the measured pressure-driven ionic transport (characterized by streaming mobilities) by up to 20 times. This gating effect is observed in both graphite and hexagonal boron nitride channels but exhibits marked material-dependent differences. We use a modified continuum framework accounting for the material-dependent frictional interaction of water molecules, ions and the confining surfaces to explain the differences observed between channels made of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. This highly nonlinear gating of fluid transport under molecular-scale confinement may offer new routes to control molecular and ion transport, and to explore electromechanical couplings that may have a role in recently discovered mechanosensitive ionic channels23.},

abstract = {Controlling nucleation and growth is crucial in biological and artificial mineralization and self-assembly processes. The nucleation barrier is determined by the chemistry of the interfaces at which crystallization occurs and local supersaturation. Although chemically tailored substrates and lattice mismatches are routinely used to modify energy landscape at the substrate/nucleus interface and thereby steer heterogeneous nucleation, strategies to combine this with control over local supersaturations have remained virtually unexplored. Here we demonstrate simultaneous control over both parameters to direct the positioning and growth direction of mineralizing compounds on preselected polymorphic substrates. We exploit the polymorphic nature of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) to locally manipulate the carbonate concentration and lattice mismatch between the nucleus and substrate, such that barium carbonate (BaCO 3 ) and strontium carbonate (SrCO 3 ) nucleate only on specific CaCO 3 polymorphs. Based on this approach we position different materials and shapes on predetermined CaCO 3 polymorphs in sequential steps, and guide the growth direction using locally created supersaturations. These results shed light on nature's remarkable mineralization capabilities and outline fabrication strategies for advanced materials, such as ceramics photonic structures and semiconductors.},

We study thermal equilibrium of classical pointlike counterions confined between symmetrically charged walls at distance d . At very large couplings when the counterion system is in its crystal phase, a harmonic expansion of particle deviations is made around the bilayer positions, with a free lattice parameter determined from a variational approach. For each of the two walls, the harmonic expansion implies an effective one-body potential at the root of all observables of interest in our Wigner strong-coupling expansion. Analytical results for the particle density profile and the pressure are in good agreement with numerical Monte Carlo data, for small as well as intermediate values of d comparable with the Wigner lattice spacing. While the strong-coupling theory is extended to the fluid regime by using the concept of a correlation hole, the Wigner calculations appear trustworthy for all electrostatic couplings investigated.

abstract = {Electrostatically stabilized aqueous suspensions of bromopolystyrene particles have been studied by scattering and osmotic pressure measurements. We investigated their structure and the interparticle interactions as a function of the volume fraction at very low salinity of the order of micromole/l. At slow crystallization speed we observe perfect crystals, body centrered cubic crystals by light scattering for volume fractions between 0.04 and 0.7{\%} and face centrered cubic crystals by Ultra Small Angle X-ray Scattering (USAXS) for higher volume fractions (2-12{\%}). After shear the crystal displays other structures. At low volume fractions (0.1-0.3{\%}), some reflexions disappear by light scattering whereas a strong diffuse ''prepeak'' appears before the first Bragg peak for higher concentrations (2-12{\%}) evidenced by USAXS. This ''prepeak'' can be attributed to defects in the crystal. Osmotic pressures have been measured by difference between the hydrostatic pressure in the solution and in the reservoir separated by an hemipermeable membrane. The experimental data are very well reproduced by the Poisson Boltzmann Cell (PBC) theory which shows that the interaction between particles is purely repulsive. No attractive contribution has been experimentally detected. By calculating the mean square displacement of a particle inside its cage from the eccentric PBC model, we have verified that the Lindemann criterion for the existence of crystals (against melting) is satisfied. This study has allowed to determine the equation of state of an electrostatical colloidal crystal and is equivalent to an ultraprecise force/distance measurement between latex particles since the measured forces are of the order of 10(-12) N for distances of the order of 4000 Angstrom.},

abstract = {The transport of fluid in and around nanometer-sized objects with at least one characteristic dimension below 100 nm enables the occurrence of phenomena that are impossible at bigger length scales. This research field was only recently termed nanofluidics, but it has deep roots in science and technology. Nanofluidics has experienced considerable growth in recent years, as is confirmed by significant scientific and practical achievements. This review focuses on the physical properties and operational mechanisms of the most common structures, such as nanometer-sized openings and nanowires in solution on a chip. Since the surface-to-volume ratio increases with miniaturization, this ratio is high in nanochannels, resulting in surface-charge-governed transport, which allows ion separation and is described by a comprehensive electrokinetic theory. The charge selectivity is most pronounced if the Debye screening length is comparable to the smallest dimension of the nanochannel cross section, leading to a predominantly counterion containing nanometer-sized aperture. These unique properties contribute to the charge-based partitioning of biomolecules at the microchannel-nanochannel interface. Additionally, at this free-energy barrier, size-based partitioning can be achieved when biomolecules and nanoconstrictions have similar dimensions. Furthermore, nanopores and nanowires are rooted in interesting physical concepts, and since these structures demonstrate sensitive, label-free, and real-time electrical detection of biomolecules, the technologies hold great promise for the life sciences. The purpose of this review is to describe physical mechanisms on the nanometer scale where new phenomena occur, in order to exploit these unique properties and realize integrated sample preparation and analysis systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Physical Society. Removing particles from fibrous materials involves loosening via surfactants followed by particle transfer in a flow. While flow advection is commonly believed to be the major driver for pore-scale transport, small pores within the fabric do not allow any significant fluid flow inside them, thus significantly reducing the role of advection. However, rinsing the fabric with fresh water naturally establishes a surfactant gradient within the pore space, providing a suitable environment for particles to undergo diffusiophoresis. We demonstrate that this mechanism can remove particles from deep within fabric pores at an accelerated rate. The nonlinear aspect of diffusiophoresis significantly prolongs the lifetime of the phoretic motion beyond the naive solute diffusion time scale during rinsing, allowing long-lasting, continuous removal of particles. Moreover, owing to the fine balance between chemiphoresis and electrophoresis for particles in anionic surfactant concentration gradients, we show that the particle removal is sensitive to the counterion mobility, suggesting a simple route to control the effect. We thus claim to have resolved the "stagnant core problem" - a long-standing mystery in laundry detergency - and have identified a physicochemical approach to particle transport in fibrous media with broad applicability.},

abstract = {It is generally agreed that the cohesion of cement paste occurs through the formation of a network of nanoparticles of a calcium-silicate-hydrate ("C-S-H"). However, the mechanism by which these particles develop this cohesion has not been established. Here we propose a dielectric continuum model which includes all ionic interactions within a dispersion of C-S-H particles. It takes into account all co-ions and counterions explicitly (with pure Coulomb interactions between ions and between ions and the surfaces) and makes no further assumptions concerning their hydration or their interactions with the surface sites. At high surface charge densities, the model shows that the surface charge of C-S-H particles is overcompensated by Ca 2+ ions, giving a reversal of the apparent particle charge. Also, at high surface charge densities, the model predicts that the correlations of ions located around neighboring particles causes an attraction between the particle surfaces. This attraction has a range of approximately 3 nm and a magnitude of 1 nN, values that are in good agreement with recent AFM experiments. These predictions are stable with respect to small changes in surface-surface separation, hydrated ion radius, and dielectric constant of the solution. The model also describes the effect of changes in cement composition through the introduction of other ions, either monovalent (Na) or multivalent (aluminum or iron hydroxide).},

abstract = {We review recent computer simulation studies of undulating lipid bilayers. Theoretical interpretations of such fluctuating membranes are most commonly based on generalized Helfrich-type elastic models, with additional contributions of local "protrusions" and/or density fluctuations. Such models provide an excellent basis for describing the fluctuations of tensionless bilayers in the fluid L$\alpha$ phase at a quantitative level. However, this description is found to fail for membranes in the gel phase and for membranes subject to high tensions. The fluctuations of tilted gel membranes (L$\beta$′ phase) show a signature of the modulated ripple structure P$\beta$′, which is a nearby phase observed in the pretransition regime between the L$\alpha$ and L $\beta$′ state. This complicates a quantitative analysis on mesoscopic length scales. In the case of fluid membranes under tension, the large-wavelength fluctuation modes are found to be significantly softer than predicted by theory. In the latter context, we also address the general problem of the relation between frame tension and the fluctuation tension, which has been discussed somewhat controversially in recent years. Simulations of very simple model membranes with fixed area show that the fluctuations should be controlled by the frame tension, and not by the internal tension. {\textcopyright} 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

For ternary mixtures, we find up to eight fundamentally different percolated states. The states differ in terms of the species and pairs of species that have percolated. The strongest gel is a trigel or tricontinuous gel, in which each of the three species has percolated. The weakest gel is a mixed gel in which all of the particles have percolated, but none of the species percolates by itself. The competition between entropy of mixing and internal energy of bonding determines the stability of each state. Theoretical and simulation results are in very good agreement. The only significant difference is the temperature at the percolation threshold, which is overestimated by the theory due to the absence of correlations between bonds in the theoretical description.},

The calculation requires a quantitative description of the intermolecular potentials of mean force acting between like (1-1 and 2-2) and unlike (1-2) species. Example calculations are carried out for solutions of species interacting via spherically symmetric square-well potentials as first-order models for protein-protein interaction. When the interaction between species 1 and 2 is more repulsive than those acting between like species, the two-phase region is characterized by an equilibrium between a phase enriched in 1 and depleted in 2 and a phase enriched in 2 and depleted in 1. When the interaction between species 1 and 2 is more attractive than those acting between like species, the two-phase region is characterized by an equilibrium between a phase enriched in both species and a phase depleted in both species. The latter example provides a first-order description of coacervate formation without postulating specific interactions between the two solute species.},

abstract = {We analyze, using Monte Carlo simulations, how a dielectric medium, modeled as a Stockmayer fluid, modulates the force between two similarly charged surfaces. A major objective is to provide a basis for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the primitive model. The system studied has uniformly charged walls separated by counterions and solvent, where the latter is kept at constant chemical potential as the separation between the walls is varied. For two different types of Stockmayer fluids, one with a "low" ($\epsilon$r ≃ 4.4) and one with a "high" ($\epsilon$r ≃ 20) relative dielectric permittivity, the size of the solvent molecules is varied systematically. As the size of the solvent molecules becomes smaller one approaches the continuum limit, where the primitive model should give an increasingly more accurate representation. We find that having an explicit description of the solvent gives rise to an oscillatory component in the force between the surfaces. The wavelength of the oscillations reflects the diameter of the solvent molecules. The smaller the solvent molecules the smaller are the amplitudes of the oscillations. On integrating the force curves to yield interaction free energies the oscillatory features become less apparent. For the smallest solvent size studied the interaction curves show clear similarities with those obtained from the primitive model. The qualitative effect of the dielectric screening is recovered. It is found that the deviations from the mean field description also appear for the molecular solvent. All this suggests that there are no major deviations due to the neglect of many-body contributions in the solvent-averaged potential of the primitive model. This also holds for the incompressibility assumption implicitly applied when using the primitive model. {\textcopyright} 2011 the Owner Societies.},

In relict lime clasts, the crystals have calcium contents that are similar to ideal tobermorite, 33 to 35 wt{\%}, but the low-silica contents, 39 to 40 wt{\%}, reflect Al3+ substitution for Si4+ in Q2(1Al), Q3(1Al), and Q3(2 Al) tetrahedral chain and branching sites. The Al-tobermorite has a double silicate chain structure with long chain lengths in the b [020] crystallographic direction, and wide interlayer spacing, 11.49 {\AA}. Na+ and K+ partially balance Al3+ substitution for Si4+. Poorly crystalline calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate (C-A-S-H) cementitious binder in the dissolved perimeter of relict lime clasts has Ca/(Si+Al) = 0.79, nearly identical to the Al-tobermorite, but nanoscale heterogeneities with aluminum in both tetrahedral and octahedral coordination. The concrete is about 45 vol{\%} glassy zeolitic tuff and 55 vol{\%} hydrated lime-volcanic ash mortar; lime formed {\textless}10 wt{\%} of the mix. Trace element studies confirm that the pyroclastic rock comes from Flegrean Fields volcanic district, as described in ancient Roman texts. An adiabatic thermal model of the 10 m2 by 5.7 m thick Baianus Sinus breakwater from heat evolved through hydration of lime and formation of C-A-S-H suggests maximum temperatures of 85 to 97 {\textordmasculine}C. Cooling to seawater temperatures occurred in two years. These elevated temperatures and the mineralizing effects of seawater and alkali- and alumina-rich volcanic ash appear to be critical to Al-tobermorite crystallization. The long-term stability of the Al-tobermorite provides a valuable context to improve future syntheses in innovative concretes with advanced properties using volcanic pozzolans.},

abstract = {We report simulations of a simple model of particles with limited valence in two dimensions and compare the numerical results with recent predictions based on the application of the Wertheim theory. The predictions for the fraction of formed bonds are rather accurate, except at low densities and temperatures, where enhanced bonding is found. Such differences are traced-back to the break-down of the approximation of absence of intra-cluster bonding. The enhanced bonding is thus attributed to the growing entropic cost of merging different clusters when the density is low, compared to the free-energy gain of forming an intra-cluster bond. The presence of closed bond loops in finite size clusters affects the location of the percolation locus, which is located at temperature lower than expected on the basis of the Flory-Stockmayer theory. Similarly, the critical region is shifted to temperatures smaller than the ones accessible with present time numerical resources, despite the implementation of efficient cluster moves. Only a weak evidence of a low-T gas-liquid phase separation between a very dilute gas phase and a low-density percolating liquid phase is found. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

This paper considers situations, such as concentrated electrolytes, multivalent electrolytes, or solvent-free ionic liquids, where the mean-field approximation breaks down. A fourth-order modified Poisson equation is developed that captures the essential features in a simple continuum framework. The model is derived as a gradient approximation for nonlocal electrostatics of interacting effective charges, where the permittivity becomes a differential operator, scaled by a correlation length. The theory is able to capture subtle aspects of molecular simulations and allows for simple calculations of electrokinetic flows in correlated ionic fluids. Charge-density oscillations tend to reduce electro-osmotic flow and streaming current, and overscreening of surface charge can lead to flow reversal. These effects also help to explain the suppression of induced-charge electrokinetic phenomena at high salt concentrations.},

abstract = {Self-assembly is a crucial component in the bottom-up fabrication of hierarchical supramolecular structures and advanced functional materials. Control has traditionally relied on the use of encoded building blocks bearing suitable moieties for recognition and interaction, with targeting of the thermodynamic equilibrium state. On the other hand, nature leverages the control of reaction-diffusion processes to create hierarchically organized materials with surprisingly complex biological functions. Indeed, under non-equilibrium conditions (kinetic control), the spatio-temporal command of chemical gradients and reactant mixing during self-assembly (the creation of non-uniform chemical environments for example) can strongly affect the outcome of the self-assembly process. This directly enables a precise control over material properties and functions. In this tutorial review, we show how the unique physical conditions offered by microfluidic technologies can be advantageously used to control the self-assembly of materials and of supramolecular aggregates in solution, making possible the isolation of intermediate states and unprecedented non-equilibrium structures, as well as the emergence of novel functions. Selected examples from the literature will be used to confirm that microfluidic devices are an invaluable toolbox technology for unveiling, understanding and steering self-assembly pathways to desired structures, properties and functions, as well as advanced processing tools for device fabrication and integration.},

abstract = {Soft matter materials, such as polymers, membranes, proteins, are often electrically charged. This makes them water soluble, which is of great importance in technological application and a prerequisite for biological function. We discuss a few static and dynamic systems that are dominated by charge effects. One class comprises complexation between oppositely charged objects, for example the adsorption of charged ions or charged polymers on oppositely charged substrates of different geometry. Here the main questions are whether adsorption occurs and what the effective charge of the resulting complex is. We explicitly discuss the adsorption behavior of polyelectrolytes on substrates of planar, cylindrical and spherical geometry with specific reference to DNA adsorption on supported charged lipid layers, DNA adsorption on oppositely charged cylindrical dendro-polymers, and DNA binding on globular histone proteins, respectively. In all these systems salt plays a crucial role, and some of the important features can already be obtained on the linear Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel level. The second class comprises effective interactions between similarly charged objects. Here the main theme is to understand the experimental finding that similarly and highly charged bodies attract each other in the presence of multi-valent counterions. This is demonstrated using field-theoretic arguments as well as Monte-Carlo simulations for the case of two homogeneously charged bodies. Realistic surfaces, on the other hand, are corrugated and also exhibit modulated charge distributions, which is important for static properties such as the counterion-density distribution, but has even more pronounced consequences for dynamic properties such as the counterion mobility. More pronounced dynamic effects are obtained with highly condensed charged systems in strong electric fields. Likewise, an electrostatically collapsed highly charged polymer is unfolded and oriented in strong electric fields. All charged systems occur in water, and water by itself is not a very well understood material. At the end of this review, we give a very brief and incomplete account of the behavior of water at planar surfaces. The coupling between water structure and charge effects is largely unexplored, and a few directions for future research are sketched. On an even more nanoscopic level, we demonstrate using ab initio methods that specific interactions between oppositely charged groups (which occur when their electron orbitals start to overlap) are important and cause ion-specific effects that have recently moved into the focus of interest. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Surfactants play a ubiquitous role in many areas of science and technology, and gradients often form - either spontaneously or intentionally - in a variety of nonequilibrium situations and processes. We visualize and measure the diffusiophoretic migration of latex colloids in response to gradients of cationic and anionic surfactants, both below and above the critical micelle concentration (cmc). Below the cmc, colloidal migration can be described using classic theories for diffusiophoresis under electrolyte gradients, although subtleties and distinctions do appear. Cationic surfactants adsorb onto anionic colloids, changing the surface charge and thus reversing the direction of diffusiophoretic migration. Above the cmc, diffusiophoretic mobilties decrease by orders of magnitude. We argue this to occur because charged monomers (rather than micelles) dominate colloidal diffusiophoresis. Because monomer concentrations remain essentially constant above the cmc, surfactant gradients imposed above the cmc result in very small monomer gradients - and, therefore, very weak diffusiophoresis. Our findings suggest conceptual strategies to understand diffusiophoresis in the presence of surfactants, as well as strategies to predict and design systems that harness them.},

These organelles play key biological roles, by compartmentalizing the cell to enable spatiotemporal control of biological reactions. Recent studies suggest that membrane-less intracellular compartments are multicomponent viscous liquid droplets that form via phase separation. Proteins that have an intrinsic tendency for being conformationally heterogeneous seem to be the main drivers of liquid-liquid phase separation in the cell. These findings highlight the relevance of classical concepts from the physics of polymeric phase transitions for understanding the assembly of intracellular membrane-less compartments. However, applying these concepts is challenging, given the heteropolymeric nature of protein sequences, the complex intracellular environment, and non-equilibrium features intrinsic to cells.

abstract = {The interaction between a biological membrane and its environment is a complex process, as it involves multivalent binding between ligand/receptor pairs, which can self-organize in patches. Any description of the specific binding of biomolecules to membranes must account for the key characteristics of multivalent binding, namely, its unique ability to discriminate sharply between high and low receptor densities (superselectivity), but also for the effect of the lateral mobility of membrane-bound receptors to cluster upon binding. Here we present an experimental model system that allows us to compare systematically the effects of multivalent interactions on fluid and immobile surfaces. A crucial feature of our model system is that it allows us to control the membrane surface chemistry, the properties of the multivalent binder, and the binding affinity. We find that multivalent probes retain their superselective binding behavior at fluid interfaces. Supported by numerical simulations, we demonstrate that, as a consequence of receptor clustering, superselective binding is enhanced and shifted to lower receptor densities at fluid interfaces. To translate our findings into a simple, predictive tool, we propose an analytical model that enables rapid predictions of how the superselective binding behavior is affected by the lateral receptor mobility as a function of the physicochemical characteristics of the multivalent probe. We believe that our model, which captures the key physical mechanisms underpinning multivalent binding to biological membranes, will greatly facilitate the rational design of nanoprobes for the superselective targeting of cells.},

Herein, we demonstrate that RNA, a primary component of RNP granules, can modulate the phase behavior of RNPs by controlling both droplet assembly and dissolution in vitro. Monotonically increasing the RNA concentration initially leads to droplet assembly by complex coacervation and subsequently triggers an RNP charge inversion, which promotes disassembly. This RNA-mediated reentrant phase transition can drive the formation of dynamic droplet substructures (vacuoles) with tunable lifetimes. We propose that active cellular processes that can create an influx of RNA into RNP granules, such as transcription, can spatiotemporally control the organization and dynamics of such liquid-like organelles.},

We study thermal equilibrium of classical pointlike counterions confined between symmetrically charged walls at distance d . At very large couplings when the counterion system is in its crystal phase, a harmonic expansion of particle deviations is made around the bilayer positions, with a free lattice parameter determined from a variational approach. For each of the two walls, the harmonic expansion implies an effective one-body potential at the root of all observables of interest in our Wigner strong-coupling expansion. Analytical results for the particle density profile and the pressure are in good agreement with numerical Monte Carlo data, for small as well as intermediate values of d comparable with the Wigner lattice spacing. While the strong-coupling theory is extended to the fluid regime by using the concept of a correlation hole, the Wigner calculations appear trustworthy for all electrostatic couplings investigated. Our results significantly extend the range of accuracy of analytical equations of state for strongly interacting charged planar interfaces.},

abstract = {We propose a method to model metallic surfaces in Lattice Boltzmann Electrokinetics simulations (LBE), a lattice-based algorithm rooted in kinetic theory which captures the coupled solvent and ion dynamics in electrolyte solutions. This is achieved by a simple rule to impose electrostatic boundary conditions, in a consistent way with the location of the hydrodynamic interface for stick boundary conditions. The proposed method also provides the local charge induced on the electrode by the instantaneous distribution of ions under voltage. We validate it in the low voltage regime by comparison with analytical results in two model nanocapacitors: parallel plate and coaxial electrodes. We examine the steady-state ionic concentrations and electric potential profiles (and corresponding capacitance), the time-dependent response of the charge on the electrodes, as well as the steady-state electro-osmotic profiles in the presence of an additional, tangential electric field. The LBE method further provides the time-dependence of these quantities, as illustrated on the electro-osmotic response. While we do not consider this case in the present work, which focuses on the validation of the method, the latter readily applies to large voltages between the electrodes, as well as to time-dependent voltages. This work opens the way to the LBE simulation of more complex systems involving electrodes and metallic surfaces, such as sensing devices based on nanofluidic channels and nanotubes, or porous electrodes.},

We compare the experimentally measured functional form of the trapping potential with that from free energy calculations and thereby determine the net surface charge in the system. Our findings clearly demonstrate that contrary to popular perception, even in the absence of surfactants, the net electrical charge of ionizable surfaces in contact with apolar solvents can be large enough to lead to significant repulsive forces. A charge regulation model for SiO2 surfaces with a single tunable parameter explains our measurements. This model may find general applicability in estimating the net charge of ionizable surfaces, given system parameters such as the dissociation or association constants of the ionizable groups and the pH, ionic strength, and dielectric constant of the solvent phase.},

Our analysis is based on a theoretical investigation of the real part of the electrical impedance of an electrolytic cell. When the mobility of the positive ions differs from that of the negative ions, a second plateau of the resistance of the cell, in series representation, is expected close to the dc limit of the applied voltage. The effective diffusion coefficient, related to the measured resistance of the cell, in the dc limit, coincides with the ambipolar diffusion coefficient. The associated relaxation time corresponds to the ambipolar diffusion, and it is proportional to the square of the thickness of the sample. In the high-frequency range, the relaxation time coincides with the Debye relaxation time, connected to the free diffusion coefficient, and it is independent of the thickness of the sample. Finally, we propose a method to calculate the diffusion coefficients of the individual ions from the impedance spectrum and we discuss the implications of ambipolar diffusion in impedance measurements and interpretation of experimental quantities. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

In contrast to earlier works, our results are not restricted to the long-time asymptotics of those quantities.

Although these filament systems in some cases form structures that are very similar to eukaryotic cytoskeletons, the term 'prokaryotic cytoskeletons' is used to refer to many different kinds of protein filaments. Cytoskeletons achieve their functions through polymerization of protein monomers and the resulting ability to access length scales larger than the size of the monomer. Prokaryotic cytoskeletons are involved in many fundamental aspects of prokaryotic cell biology and have important roles in cell shape determination, cell division and nonchromosomal DNA segregation. Some of the filament-forming proteins have been classified into a small number of conserved protein families, for example, the almost ubiquitous tubulin and actin superfamilies. To understand what makes filaments special and how the cytoskeletons they form enable cells to perform essential functions, the structure and function of cytoskeletal molecules and their filaments have been investigated in diverse bacteria and archaea. In this Review, we bring these data together to highlight the diverse ways that linear protein polymers can be used to organize other molecules and structures in bacteria and archaea.},

The equilibrium statistical mechanics of the system depends on a single dimensionless coupling parameter. A new self-consistent theory of the correlation-hole type is proposed which leads to a modified Poisson-Boltzmann integral equation for the density profile, convenient for analytical progress and straightforward to solve numerically. The exact density profiles are recovered in the limits of weak and strong couplings. In contrast to previous theoretical attempts of the test-charge family, the density profiles fulfill the contact-value theorem at all values of the coupling constant, and exhibit the mean-field decay at asymptotically large distances from the wall, as expected. We furthermore show that the density corrections at large couplings exhibit the proper dependence on coupling parameter and distance to the charged wall. The numerical results for intermediate values of the coupling provide accurate density profiles which are in good agreement with those obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations. The crossover to mean-field behavior at large distance is studied in detail.},

abstract = {For some decades now, nanotechnology has been touted as the 'next big thing' with potential impact comparable to the steam, electricity or Internet revolutions-but has it lived up to these expectations? While advances in top-down nanolithography, now reaching 10-nm resolution, have resulted in devices that are rapidly approaching mass production, attempts to produce nanoscale devices using bottom-up approaches have met with only limited success. We have been inundated with nanoparticles of almost any shape, material and composition, but their societal impact has been far from revolutionary, with growing concerns over their toxicity. Despite nebulous hopes that making hierarchical nanomaterials will lead to new, emergent properties, no breakthrough applications seem imminent. In this Perspective, we argue that the time is ripe to look beyond individual nano-objects and their static assemblies, and instead focus on systems comprising different types of 'nanoparts' interacting and/or communicating with one another to perform desired functions. Such systems are interesting for a variety of reasons: they can act autonomously without external electrical or optical connections, can be dynamic and reconfigurable, and can act as 'nanomachines' by directing the flow of mass, energy or information. In thinking how this systems nanoscience approach could be implemented to design useful-as opposed to toy-model-nanosystems, our choice of applications and our nanoengineering should be inspired by living matter.},

abstract = {The electrostatic complexation between DOTAP/DOPC unilamellar liposomes and an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (NaPA) has been investigated in a wide range of the liposome surface charge density. We systematically characterized the reentrant condensation and the charge inversion of polyelectrolyte-decorated liposomes by means of dynamic light scattering and electrophoresis. We explored the stability of this model polyelectrolyte/colloid system at different values of the surface charge of the bare liposomes and by changing two independent control parameters of the suspensions: the polyelectrolyte/colloid charge ratio and the ionic strength of the aqueous suspending medium. The progressive addition of neutral DOPC lipid within the liposome membrane gave rise to an interesting phenomenon which has not been observed previously: the stability diagram of the suspensions showed a novel reentrance due to the crossing of the desorption threshold of the polyelectrolyte. Indeed, at fixed charge density of the bare DOTAP/DOPC liposomes and for a wide range of polyion concentrations, we showed that the simple electrolyte addition first (low salt regime) destabilizes the suspensions because of the enhanced screening of the residual repulsion between the complexes, and then (high salt regime) determines the onset of a new stable phase, originated by the absence of polyelectrolyte adsorption on the particle surfaces. We show that the observed phenomenology can be rationalized within the modified Velegol-Thwar model for heterogeneously charged particles and that the polyelectrolyte desorption fits well the predictions of the adsorption theory of Winkler and Cherstvy [1]. Our findings unambiguously support the picture of the reentrant condensation as driven by the correlated adsorption of the polyelectrolyte chains on the particle surface, providing interesting insights into possible mechanisms for tailoring complex colloids via salt-induced effects.},

abstract = {A fundamental and intrinsic property of any device or natural system is its relaxation time relax, which is the time it takes to return to equilibrium after the sudden change of a control parameter [1]. Reducing {\$}tau{\$} relax , is frequently necessary, and is often obtained by a complex feedback process. To overcome the limitations of such an approach, alternative methods based on driving have been recently demonstrated [2, 3], for isolated quantum and classical systems [4--9]. Their extension to open systems in contact with a thermostat is a stumbling block for applications. Here, we design a protocol,named Engineered Swift Equilibration (ESE), that shortcuts time-consuming relaxations, and we apply it to a Brownian particle trapped in an optical potential whose properties can be controlled in time. We implement the process experimentally, showing that it allows the system to reach equilibrium times faster than the natural equilibration rate. We also estimate the increase of the dissipated energy needed to get such a time reduction. The method paves the way for applications in micro and nano devices, where the reduction of operation time represents as substantial a challenge as miniaturization [10]. The concepts of equilibrium and of transformations from an equilibrium state to another, are cornerstones of thermodynamics. A textbook illustration is provided by the expansion of a gas, starting at equilibrium and expanding to reach a new equilibrium in a larger vessel. This operation can be performed either very slowly by a piston, without dissipating energy into the environment, or alternatively quickly, letting the piston freely move to reach the new volume.},

Among the functions the various collagens are involved in are cell adhesion and migration, tissue repair, scaffolding and morphogenesis. Thus knowledge about the structure and properties of collagen, how they change depending on the nature of the local environment as well as the nature and specificity of collagen interactions with its partners is central to discerning the role of collagen in medical applications such as imaging, drug delivery and tissue engineering, and in the design and construction of synthetic collagen-like materials for tools in biomaterial science and nanotechnology.

Analytical results for the particle density profile and the pressure are in good agreement with numerical Monte Carlo data, for small as well as intermediate values of d comparable with the Wigner lattice spacing.

abstract = {Different charged colloidal particles have been shown to be able to self-assemble, when mixed in an aqueous solvent with oppositely charged linear polyelectrolytes, forming long-lived finite-size mesoscopic aggregates. On increasing the polyelectrolyte content, with the progressive reduction of the net charge of the primary polyelectrolyte-decorated particles, larger and larger clusters are observed. Close to the isoelectric point, where the charge of the adsorbed polyelectrolytes neutralizes the original charge of the particles' surface, the aggregates reach their maximum size, while beyond this point any further increase of the polyelectrolyte-particle charge ratio causes the formation of aggregates whose size is progressively reduced. This re-entrant condensation behavior is accompanied by a significant overcharging. Overcharging, or charge inversion, occurs when more polyelectrolyte chains adsorb on a particle than are needed to neutralize its original charge so that, eventually, the sign of the net charge of the polymer-decorated particle is inverted. The stability of the finite-size long-lived clusters that this aggregation process yields results from a fine balance between long-range repulsive and short-range attractive interactions, both of electrostatic nature. For the latter, besides the ubiquitous dispersion forces, whose supply becomes relevant only at high ionic strength, the main contribution appears due to the non-uniform correlated distribution of the charge on the surface of the polyelectrolyte-decorated particles ('charge-patch' attraction). The interesting phenomenology shown by these system has a high potential for biotechnological applications, particularly when the primary colloidal particles are bio-compatible lipid vesicles. Possible applications of these systems as multi-compartment vectors for the simultaneous intra-cellular delivery of different pharmacologically active substances will be briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Recently, it was demonstrated that ions from the electrolyte could enter sub nanometre pores, greatly increasing the capacitance. However, the molecular mechanism of this enhancement remains poorly understood. Here we provide the first quantitative picture of the structure of an ionic liquid adsorbed inside realistically modelled microporous carbon electrodes. We show how the separation of the positive and negative ions occurs inside the porous disordered carbons, yielding much higher capacitance values (125 F g(-1)) than with simpler electrode geometries. The proposed mechanism opens the door for the design of materials with improved energy storage capabilities. It also sheds new light on situations where ion adsorption in porous structures or membranes plays a role.},

We develop an analytical model that provides simple yet quantitative predictions to tune the polymer's superselective binding properties by its molecular characteristics such as size, valency, and affinity. This work opens up a route toward the rational design of multivalent probes with defined superselective targeting properties for practical applications, and provides mechanistic insight into the regulation of multivalent interactions in biology. To illustrate this, we show how the superselective targeting of the extracellular matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan to its main cell surface receptor CD44 is controlled by the affinity of individual CD44-hyaluronan interactions.},

abstract = {Fiber supercapacitors utilizing one-dimensional cylindrically shaped fibers as electrodes have shown great application potential in wearable electronics and smart textiles.Supercapacitors (SCs) are energy storage devices which have high power density and long cycle life. Conventional SCs have two-dimensional planar structures. As a new family of SCs, fiber SCs utilize one-dimensional cylindrically shaped fibers as electrodes. They have attracted significant interest since 2011 and have shown great application potential either as micro-scale devices to complement or even replace micro-batteries in miniaturized electronics and microelectromechanical systems or as macro-scale devices for wearable electronics or smart textiles. This tutorial review provides an essential introduction to this new field. We first introduce the basics of performance evaluation for fiber SCs as a foundation to understand different research approaches and the diverse performance metrics reported in the literature. Next, we summarize the current state-of-the-art progress in structure design and electrode fabrication of fiber SCs. This is followed by a discussion on the integration of multiple fiber SCs and the combination with other energy harvesting or storage devices. Last, we present our perspectives on the future development of fiber SCs and highlight key technical challenges with the hope of stimulating further research progress.},

abstract = {We analyze the classical problem of the interaction between two charged surfaces separated by a solution containing neutralizing counter-ions. The focus is on obtaining a description where the solvent is treated explicitly rather than through a dielectric approximation as is conventionally done. We summarize the results of three papers where we have used a Stockmayer fluid model in Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the attractive ion–ion correlation mechanism is also operating when the solvent is described explicitly. There appears an oscillatory component to the force, but when this is accounted for, there is a semi-quantitative agreement between the continuum model and the model with explicit solvent. The properties of the continuum model can be reached in a molecular system by making the solvent molecules much smaller than the ions. It is demonstrated that having an explicit solvent model makes the analysis of force mechanisms more delicate due to the interplay between several different microscopic contributions to the force. Finally, it is argued that the agreement between the forces calculated using the continuum and the explicit solvent models, respectively, has as its basis the circumstance that the force between the surfaces is mainly caused by long-range ion–ion interactions, for which the dielectric approximation is most adequate. This argument applies equally well to an aqueous system as to the Stockmayer fluid.},

The electrostatic energy increases as the salt concentration of the solution is reduced due to diffusion.

abstract = {Experiments of nanoconfined water between graphene sheets at high pressure suggest that it forms a square ice structure (Algara-Siller et al., Nature, 2015, 519, 443). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to attempt to recreate this structure, but there have been discrepancies in the structure formed by the confined water depending on the simulation set-up that was employed and particularly on the choice of water model. Here, using classical molecular dynamics simulations, we have systematically investigated the effect that three different water models (SPC/E, TIP4P/2005 and TIP5P) have on the structure of water confined between two rigid graphene sheets with a 0.9 nm separation. We show that the TIP4P/2005 and the TIP5P water models form a hexagonal AA-stacked structure, whereas the SPC/E model forms a rhombic AB-stacked structure. Our work demonstrates that the formation of these structures is driven by differences in the strength of hydrogen bonds predicted by the three water models, and that the nature of the graphene/water interaction only mildly affects the phase diagram. Considering the available experimental data and first-principle simulations we conclude that, among the models tested, the TIP4P/2005 and TIP5P force fields are for now the most reliable when simulating water under confinement. {\textcopyright} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

These shortcomings are not only a consequence of the limitations of the mean-field approximation per se, but perhaps are primarily due to the fact that the purely Coulombic model Hamiltonian does not take into account various additional interactions that are not electrostatic in their origin. We explore several possible non-electrostatic contributions to the free energy of ions in confined aqueous solutions and investigate their ramifications and consequences on ionic profiles and interactions between charged surfaces and macromolecules.},

Fluid transport that is driven by gradients of pressure, gravity, or electro-magnetic potential is well-known and studied in many fields. A subtler type of transport, called diffusiophoresis, occurs in a gradient of chemical concentration, either electrolyte or non-electrolyte. Diffusiophoresis works by driving a slip velocity at the fluid-solid interface. Although the mechanism is well-known, the diffusiophoresis mechanism is often considered to be an esoteric laboratory phenomenon. However, in this article we show that concentration gradients can develop in a surprisingly wide variety of physical phenomena-imposed gradients, asymmetric reactions, dissolution, crystallization, evaporation, mixing, sedimentation, and others-so that diffusiophoresis is in fact a very common transport mechanism, in both natural and artificial systems. We anticipate that in georeservoir extractions, physiological systems, drying operations, laboratory and industrial separations, crystallization operations, membrane processes, and many other situations, diffusiophoresis is already occurring-often without being recognized-and that opportunities exist for designing this transport to great advantage.},

This was accomplished in 8 microseconds, corresponding to 16 periods of oscillation. Starting from a state with n=0.1 quanta, during transport the ion was excited to a displaced coherent state with n=1.6 quanta but on completion was returned close to its motional ground state with n=0.2. Similar results were achieved for the transport of two ions. We also separated chains of up to 9 ions from one potential well to two distinct potential wells. With two ions this was accomplished in 55 microseconds, with final excitations of about 2 quanta for each ion. Fast coherent transport and separation can significantly reduce the time overhead in certain architectures for scalable quantum information processing with trapped ions.},

abstract = {Despite decades of studies of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), the structurally complex binder phase of concrete, the interplay between chemical composition and density remains essentially unexplored. Together these characteristics of C-S-H define and modulate the physical and mechanical properties of this "liquid stone" gel phase. With the recent determination of the calcium/silicon (C/S = 1.7) ratio and the density of the C-S-H particle (2.6 g/cm(3)) by neutron scattering measurements, there is new urgency to the challenge of explaining these essential properties. Here we propose a molecular model of C-S-H based on a bottom-up atomistic simulation approach that considers only the chemical specificity of the system as the overriding constraint. By allowing for short silica chains distributed as monomers, dimers, and pentamers, this C-S-H archetype of a molecular description of interacting CaO, SiO2, and H2O units provides not only realistic values of the C/S ratio and the density computed by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation of water adsorption at 300 K. The model, with a chemical composition of (CaO)(1.65)(SiO2)(H2O)(1.75), also predicts other essential structural features and fundamental physical properties amenable to experimental validation, which suggest that the C-S-H gel structure includes both glass-like short-range order and crystalline features of the mineral tobermorite. Additionally, we probe the mechanical stiffness, strength, and hydrolytic shear response of our molecular model, as compared to experimentally measured properties of C-S-H. The latter results illustrate the prospect of treating cement on equal footing with metals and ceramics in the current application of mechanism-based models and multiscale simulations to study inelastic deformation and cracking.},

abstract = {We show that the screening of the electrostatic potential in electrolytes can in exact theory be expressed in terms of a generalized screened Colomb potential, analogous to the Yukawa potential from the Debye-Huckel approximation, provided the source charge of the potential is renormalized. The renormalized charge distribution is identical to that of a "dressed particle" in dressed ion theory, DIT, of Kjellander and Mitchell. Using DIT we analyze the leading terms of the decay of density profiles and electrostatic potential outside a charged planar wall in contact with 1:2 electrolytes. The formalism leads in a natural manner to the definition of a primary and a secondary effective charge of an object immersed in an electrolyte. These charges are associated with the leading and second leading decay modes of the potential, which have different decay lengths. It is found that both leading terms in the decay are important, together, they give in many cases a very good representation of the density profiles and the potential for distances larger than about a couple of ionic diameters from the wall. When varying the actual (bare) surface charge density sigma of the wall, two points of zero effective surface charge density are found: one at low (but nonzero) and one at high value of sigma. The former occurs when the counterions are monovalent and the latter when the counterions are divalent and the electrolyte concentration is sufficiently high. Both are associated with effective charge reversals where the surface appears to attain a charge of opposite sign compared to its bare charge. The double layer interaction between two equally charged particles is attractive at large separations at a point of zero effective surface charge.},

abstract = {Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study the counterion distribution close to planar charged walls in two geometries: i) when only one charged wall is present and the counterions are confined to one half-space, and ii) when the counterions are confined between two equally charged walls. In both cases the surface charge is smeared out and the dielectric constant is the same everywhere. We obtain the counterion density profile and compare it with both the Poisson-Boltzmann theory (asymptotically exact in the limit of weak coupling, i.e. low surface charge, high temperature and low counterion valence) and the strong-coupling theory (valid in the opposite limit of high surface charge, low temperature and high counterion valence) and with previously calculated correction terms to both theories for different values of the coupling parameter, thereby establishing the domain of validity of the asymptotic limits. Gaussian corrections to the leading Poisson-Boltzmann behavior (obtained via a systematic loop expansion) in general perform quite poorly: At coupling strengths low enough so that the Gaussian (or one-loop) correction does describe the numerical deviations from the Poisson-Boltzmann result correctly, the leading Poisson-Boltzmann term by itself matches the data within high accuracy. This reflects the slow convergence of the loop expansion. For a single charged plane, the counterion pair correlation function indicates a behavioral change from a three-dimensional, weakly correlated counterion distribution (at low coupling) to a two-dimensional, strongly correlated counterion distribution (at high coupling), which is paralleled by the specific-heat capacity which displays a rounded hump at intermediate coupling strengths. For the case of counterions confined between two equally charged walls, we analyze the inter-wall pressure and establish the complete phase diagram, featuring attraction between the walls for large enough coupling strength and at intermediate wall separation. Depending on the thermodynamic ensemble, the phase diagram exhibits a discontinuous transition where the inter-wall distance jumps to infinity (in the absence of a chemical potential coupling to the inter-wall distance, as for charged lamellae in excess solvent) or a critical point where two coexisting states with different inter-wall distance become indistinguishable (in the presence of a chemical potential, as for charged lamellae with a finite fixed solvent fraction). The attractive pressure decays with the inter-wall distance as an inverse cube, similar to analytic predictions, although the amplitude differs by an order of magnitude from previous theoretical results. Finally, we discuss in detail our simulation methods and compare the finite-size scaling behavior of different boundary conditions (periodic, minimal image and open).},

abstract = {Although Portland cement concrete is the world's most widely used manufactured material, basic questions persist regarding its internal structure and water content, and their effect on concrete behaviour. Here, for the first time without recourse to drying methods, we measure the composition and solid density of the principal binding reaction product of cement hydration, calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gel, one of the most complex of all gels. We also quantify a nanoscale calcium hydroxide phase that coexists with C-S-H gel. By combining small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering data, and by exploiting the hydrogen/deuterium neutron isotope effect both in water and methanol, we determine the mean formula and mass density of the nanoscale C-S-H gel particles in hydrating cement. We show that the formula, (CaO)1.7(SiO2)(H2O)1.80, and density, 2.604 Mg m(-3), differ from previous values for C-S-H gel, associated with specific drying conditions. Whereas previous studies have classified water within C-S-H gel by how tightly it is bound, in this study we classify water by its location-with implications for defining the chemically active (C-S-H) surface area within cement, and for predicting concrete properties.},

When scrutinized at the micro- or nanoscopic level, the continuity of the ionic–covalent bonding in the solid phase is interrupted almost everywhere by water molecules or liquid water films. The same situation is found in set plaster.Yet, plaster and cementitious materials are able to withstand stresses of the same order of magnitude as rocks. Molecular simulation studies and direct-force measurements by atomic force microscopy provide strong arguments for predicting that short- and medium-range surface forces mediated by partially or totally hydrated calcium ions are the essential components of cement strength, with additional contributions from van der Waals and capillary forces. This provides a clue for understanding the nano- and mesostructure of cement-based materials and new levers for improving their properties.},

The pyrenoid matrix is densely packed with the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco and is thought to be a crystalline or amorphous solid. Here, we show that the pyrenoid matrix of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is not crystalline but behaves as a liquid that dissolves and condenses during cell division. Furthermore, we show that new pyrenoids are formed both by fission and de novo assembly. Our modeling predicts the existence of a “magic number” effect associated with special, highly stable heterocomplexes that influences phase separation in liquid-like organelles. This view of the pyrenoid matrix as a phase-separated compartment provides a paradigm for understanding its structure, biogenesis, and regulation. More broadly, our findings expand our understanding of the principles that govern the architecture and inheritance of liquid-like organelles.},

abstract = {The interaction between a biological membrane and its environment is a complex process, as it involves multivalent binding between ligand/receptor pairs, which can self-organize in patches. Any description of the specific binding of biomolecules to membranes must account for the key characteristics of multivalent binding, namely, its unique ability to discriminate sharply between high and low receptor densities (superselectivity), but also for the effect of the lateral mobility of membrane-bound receptors to cluster upon binding. Here we present an experimental model system that allows us to compare systematically the effects of multivalent interactions on fluid and immobile surfaces. A crucial feature of our model system is that it allows us to control the membrane surface chemistry, the properties of the multivalent binder, and the binding affinity. We find that multivalent probes retain their superselective binding behavior at fluid interfaces. Supported by numerical simulations, we demonstrate that, as a consequence of receptor clustering, superselective binding is enhanced and shifted to lower receptor densities at fluid interfaces. To translate our findings into a simple, predictive tool, we propose an analytical model that enables rapid predictions of how the superselective binding behavior is affected by the lateral receptor mobility as a function of the physicochemical characteristics of the multivalent probe. We believe that our model, which captures the key physical mechanisms underpinning multivalent binding to biological membranes, will greatly facilitate the rational design of nanoprobes for the superselective targeting of cells.},

Clustering is also a prerequisite for liquid-liquid phase separation. It is not well understood, however, how molecular structure and cellular organization control clustering. Using coarse-grained kinetic Langevin dynamics, we performed computational experiments on a prototypical ternary system modeled after membrane-bound nephrin, the adaptor Nck1, and the actin nucleation promoting factor NWASP. Steady-state cluster size distributions favored stoichiometries that optimized binding (stoichiometry matching) but still were quite broad. At high concentrations, the system can be driven beyond the saturation boundary such that cluster size is limited only by the number of available molecules. This behavior would be predictive of phase separation. Domains close to binding sites sterically inhibited clustering much less than terminal domains because the latter effectively restrict access to the cluster interior. Increased flexibility of interacting molecules diminished clustering by shielding binding sites within compact conformations. Membrane association of nephrin increased the cluster size distribution in a density-dependent manner. These properties provide insights into how molecular ensembles function to localize and amplify cell signaling.},

These organelles play key biological roles, by compartmentalizing the cell to enable spatiotemporal control of biological reactions. Recent studies suggest that membrane-less intracellular compartments are multicomponent viscous liquid droplets that form via phase separation. Proteins that have an intrinsic tendency for being conformationally heterogeneous seem to be the main drivers of liquid-liquid phase separation in the cell. These findings highlight the relevance of classical concepts from the physics of polymeric phase transitions for understanding the assembly of intracellular membrane-less compartments. However, applying these concepts is challenging, given the heteropolymeric nature of protein sequences, the complex intracellular environment, and non-equilibrium features intrinsic to cells. This provides new opportunities for adapting established theories and for the emergence of new physics.},

abstract = {Multivalent ligands can function as inhibitors or effectors of biological processes. Potent inhibitory activity can arise from the high functional affinities of multivalent ligand-receptor interactions. Effector functions, however, are influenced not only by apparent affinities but also by alternate factors, including the ability of a ligand to cluster receptors. Little is known about the molecular features of a multivalent ligand that determine whether it will function as an inhibitor or effector. We envisioned that, by altering multivalent ligand architecture, ligands with preferences for different binding mechanisms would be generated. To this end, a series of 28 ligands possessing structural diversity was synthesized. This series provides the means to explore the effects of ligand architecture on the inhibition and clustering of a model protein, the lectin concanavalin A (Con A). The structural parameters that were varied include scaffold shape, size, valency, and density of binding elements. We found that ligands with certain architectures are effective inhibitors, but others mediate receptor clustering. Specifically, high molecular weight, polydisperse polyvalent ligands are effective inhibitors of Con A binding, whereas linear oligomeric ligands generated by the ring-opening metathesis polymerization have structural properties that favor clustering. The shape of a multivalent ligand also influences specific aspects of receptor clustering. These include the rate at which the receptor is clustered, the number of receptors in the clusters, and the average interreceptor distance. Our results indicate that the architecture of a multivalent ligand is a key parameter in determining its activity as an inhibitor or effector. Diversity-oriented syntheses of multivalent ligands coupled with effective assays that can be used to compare the contributions of different binding parameters may afford ligands that function by specific mechanisms.},

abstract = {Biomolecular condensates form via phase transitions that combine phase separation or demixing and networking of key protein and RNA molecules. Proteins that drive condensate formation are either linear or branched multivalent proteins where multivalence refers to the presence of multiple protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interaction domains or motifs within a protein. Recent work has shown that multivalent protein drivers of phase transitions are in fact biological instantiations of associative polymers. Such systems can be characterized by stickers-and-spacers architectures where stickers contribute to system-specific spatial hierarchies of directional interactions and spacers control the concentration-dependent inhomogeneities in densities of stickers around one another. The collective effects of interactions among stickers and spacers lead to the emergence of dense droplet phases wherein the stickers form percolated networks of polymers. To enable the calculation of system-specific phase diagrams of multivalent proteins, we have developed LASSI (LAttice simulations of Sticker and Spacer Interactions), which is an efficient open source computational engine for lattice-based polymer simulations built on the stickers and spacers framework. In LASSI, a specific multivalent protein architecture is mapped into a set of beads on the 3-dimensional lattice space with proper coarse-graining, and specific sticker-sticker interactions are modeled as pairwise anisotropic interactions. For efficient and broad search of the conformational ensemble, LASSI uses Monte Carlo methods, and we optimized the move set so that LASSI can handle both dilute and dense systems. Also, we developed quantitative measures to extract phase boundaries from LASSI simulations, using known and hidden collective parameters. We demonstrate the application of LASSI to two known archetypes of linear and branched multivalent proteins. The simulations recapitulate observations from experiments and importantly, they generate novel quantitative insights that augment what can be gleaned from experiments alone. We conclude with a discussion of the advantages of lattice-based approaches such as LASSI and highlight the types of systems across which this engine can be deployed, either to make predictions or to enable the design of novel condensates.Author Summary Spatial and temporal organization of molecular matter is a defining hallmark of cellular ultrastructure and recent attention has focused intensely on organization afforded by membraneless organelles, which are referred to as biomolecular condensates. These condensates form via phase transitions that combine phase separation and networking of condensate-specific protein and nucleic acid molecules. Several questions remain unanswered regarding the driving forces for condensate formation encoded in the architectures of multivalent proteins, the molecular determinants of material properties of condensates, and the determinants of compositional specificity of condensates. Building on recently recognized analogies between associative polymers and multivalent proteins, we have developed and deployed LASSI, an open source computational engine that enables the calculation of system-specific phase diagrams for multivalent proteins. LASSI relies on a priori identification of stickers and spacers within a multivalent protein and mapping the stickers onto a 3-dimensional lattice. A Monte Carlo engine that incorporates a suite of novel and established move sets enables simulations that track density inhomogeneities and changes to the extent of networking among stickers as a function of protein concentration and interaction strengths. Calculation of distribution functions and other nonconserved order parameters allow us to compute full phase diagrams for multivalent proteins modeled using a stickers-and-spacers representation on simple cubic lattices. These predictions are shown to be system-specific and allow us to rationalize experimental observations while also enabling the design of systems with bespoke phase behavior. LASSI can be deployed to study the phase behavior of multicomponent systems, which allows us to make direct contact with cellular biomolecular condensates that are in fact multicomponent systems.},

abstract = {Specific or targeting is common in biology and is a key challenge in nanomedicine. It was recently demonstrated that multivalent probes can selectively target surfaces with a defined density of surface binding sites. Here we show, using a combination of experiments and simulations on multivalent polymers, that such "superselective" binding can be tuned through the design of the multivalent probe, to target a desired density of binding sites. We develop an analytical model that provides simple yet quantitative predictions to tune the polymer's superselective binding properties by its molecular characteristics such as size, valency, and affinity. This work opens up a route toward the rational design of multivalent probes with defined superselective targeting properties for practical applications, and provides mechanistic insight into the regulation of multivalent interactions in biology. To illustrate this, we show how the superselective targeting of the extracellular matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan to its main cell surface receptor CD44 is controlled by the affinity of individual CD44-hyaluronan interactions.},

abstract = {The T cell antigen receptor encounters foreign antigen during the immune response. Receptor engagement leads to activation of specific protein tyrosine kinases, which then phosphorylate multiple enzymes and adapter proteins. One such enzyme, phospholipase-C$\gamma$1, is responsible for cleavage of a plasma membrane lipid substrate, a phosphoinositide, into two second messengers, diacylglycerol, which activates several enzymes including protein kinase C, and an inositol phosphate, which induces intracellular calcium elevation. In T cells, phospholipase-C$\gamma$1 is recruited to the plasma membrane as part of a four-protein complex containing three adapter molecules. We have used recombinant proteins and synthetic phosphopeptides to reconstitute this quaternary complex in vitro. Extending biophysical tools to study concurrent interactions of the four protein components, we demonstrated the formation and determined the composition of the quaternary complex using multisignal analytical ultracentrifugation, and we characterized the thermodynamic driving forces of assembly by isothermal calorimetry. We demonstrate that the four proteins reversibly associate in a circular arrangement of binding interfaces, each protein interacting with two others. Three interactions are of high affinity, and the fourth is of low affinity, with the assembly of the quaternary complex exhibiting significant enthalpy–entropy compensation as in an entropic switch. Formation of this protein complex enables subsequent recruitment of additional molecules needed to activate phospholipase-C$\gamma$1. Understanding the formation of this complex is fundamental to full characterization of a central pathway in T cell activation. Such knowledge is critical to developing ways in which this pathway can be selectively inhibited.},

From cytoplasmic organisation inside a cell to the collective migration of cell tissue during organismal development and wound healing, phase transitions have emerged as key mechanisms underlying many crucial biological processes. However, a living system is fundamentally different from a thermal system, with driven chemical reactions (e.g. metabolism) and motility being two hallmarks of its non-equilibrium nature. In this review, we will discuss how driven chemical reactions can arrest universal coarsening kinetics expected from thermal phase separation, and how motility leads to the emergence of a novel universality class when the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken in an incompressible fluid.},

In this work, we present a generic coarse-grained model that captures the formation of self-limited assemblies observed in various soft-matter systems including nanoparticles, colloids, and polyelectrolytes. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the assembly process is self-limited when the repulsion between the particles is renormalized to balance their attraction during aggregation. The uniform finite-sized aggregates are further shown to be thermodynamically stable and tunable with a single dimensionless parameter. We find large aggregates self-organize internally into a core-shell morphology and exhibit anomalous uniformity when the constituent nanoparticles have a polydisperse size distribution.},

The calculation requires a quantitative description of the intermolecular potentials of mean force acting between like (1-1 and 2-2) and unlike (1-2) species. Example calculations are carried out for solutions of species interacting via spherically symmetric square-well potentials as first-order models for protein-protein interaction. When the interaction between species 1 and 2 is more repulsive than those acting between like species, the two-phase region is characterized by an equilibrium between a phase enriched in 1 and depleted in 2 and a phase enriched in 2 and depleted in 1. When the interaction between species 1 and 2 is more attractive than those acting between like species, the two-phase region is characterized by an equilibrium between a phase enriched in both species and a phase depleted in both species. The latter example provides a first-order description of coacervate formation without postulating specific interactions between the two solute species.},

Each particle has three identical patches, with distinct species having different types of patch. Theoretically we assume tree-like clusters and calculate the bonding probabilities using Wertheim's first-order perturbation theory for association. For ternary mixtures, we find up to eight fundamentally different percolated states. The states differ in terms of the species and pairs of species that have percolated. The strongest gel is a trigel or tricontinuous gel, in which each of the three species has percolated. The weakest gel is a mixed gel in which all of the particles have percolated, but none of the species percolates by itself. The competition between entropy of mixing and internal energy of bonding determines the stability of each state. Theoretical and simulation results are in very good agreement. The only significant difference is the temperature at the percolation threshold, which is overestimated by the theory due to the absence of correlations between bonds in the theoretical description.},

Here, we address the biophysical mechanism of this multiphase organization using quantitative reconstitution of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) with attached P-bodies in human cells. Protein-interaction networks can be viewed as interconnected complexes (nodes) of RNA-binding domains (RBDs), whose integrated RNA-binding capacity determines whether LLPS occurs upon RNA influx. Surprisingly, both RBD-RNA specificity and disordered segments of key proteins are non-essential, but modulate multiphase condensation. Instead, stoichiometry-dependent competition between protein networks for connecting nodes determines SG and P-body composition and miscibility, while competitive binding of unconnected proteins disengages networks and prevents LLPS. Inspired by patchy colloid theory, we propose a general framework by which competing networks give rise to compositionally specific and tunable condensates, while relative linkage between nodes underlies multiphase organization.},

abstract = {Ligand-induced receptor aggregation is a well-known mechanism for initiating intracellular signals but oligomerization of distal signaling molecules may also be required for signal propagation. Formation of complexes containing oligomers of the transmembrane adaptor protein, linker for the activation of T cells (LAT), has been identified as critical in mast cell and T cell activation mediated by immune response receptors. Cross-linking of LAT arises from the formation of a 2:1 complex between the adaptor Grb2 and the nucleotide exchange factor SOS1, which bridges two LAT molecules through the interaction of the Grb2 SH2 domain with a phosphotyrosine on LAT. We model this oligomerization and find that the valence of LAT for Grb2, which ranges from zero to three, is critical in determining the nature and extent of aggregation. A dramatic rise in oligomerization can occur when the valence switches from two to three. For valence three, an equilibrium theory predicts the possibility of forming a gel-like phase. This prediction is confirmed by stochastic simulations, which make additional predictions about the size of the gel and the kinetics of LAT oligomerization. We discuss the model predictions in light of recent experiments on RBL-2H3 and Jurkat E6.1 cells and suggest that the gel phase has been observed in activated mast cells. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

For the intermediate case of trivalent particles, we show that a cluster phase is present over a wide range of concentrations and interaction energies. The clusters are polydisperse in size, have a fractal dimension of 1.5, and tend to fully saturate their bonds at high interaction energies. The number of unformed bonds scales linearly with the number of particles in a cluster, which implies the absence of phase transition in the explored region of interaction energies and concentrations.

Herein, we demonstrate that RNA, a primary component of RNP granules, can modulate the phase behavior of RNPs by controlling both droplet assembly and dissolution in vitro. Monotonically increasing the RNA concentration initially leads to droplet assembly by complex coacervation and subsequently triggers an RNP charge inversion, which promotes disassembly. This RNA-mediated reentrant phase transition can drive the formation of dynamic droplet substructures (vacuoles) with tunable lifetimes. We propose that active cellular processes that can create an influx of RNA into RNP granules, such as transcription, can spatiotemporally control the organization and dynamics of such liquid-like organelles.},

abstract = {The linker for activation of T cells (LAT), the linker for activation of B cells (LAB), and the linker for activation of X cells (LAX) form a family of transmembrane adaptor proteins widely expressed in lymphocytes. These scaffolding proteins have multiple binding motifs that, when phosphorylated, bind the SH2 domain of the cytosolic adaptor Grb2. Thus, the valence of LAT, LAB and LAX for Grb2 is variable, depending on the strength of receptor activation that initiates phosphorylation. During signaling, the LAT population will exhibit a time-varying distribution of Grb2 valences from zero to three. In the cytosol, Grb2 forms 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS1. The 2:1 complex can bridge two LAT molecules when each Grb2, through their SH2 domains, binds to a phosphorylated site on a separate LAT. In T cells and mast cells, after receptor engagement, receptor phosphoyrlation is rapidly followed by LAT phosphorylation and aggregation. In mast cells, aggregates containing more than one hundred LAT molecules have been detected. Previously we considered a homogeneous population of trivalent LAT molecules and showed that for a range of Grb2, SOS1 and LAT concentrations, an equilibrium theory for LAT aggregation predicts the formation of a gel-like phase comprising a very large aggregate (superaggregate). We now extend this theory to investigate the effects of a distribution of Grb2 valence in the LAT population on the formation of LAT aggregates and superaggregate and use stochastic simulations to calculate the fraction of the total LAT population in the superaggregate. {\textcopyright} 2012 This is an open-access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

They achieve this by migrating rapidly through the crowded space of tissues and constantly sampling the surface of APCs. Upon antigen recognition, T cells decelerate and polarize towards the APC, ultimately forming a specialized interface known as the immunological synapse. These conjugates form as the result of the interaction between pairs of receptors/ligands that are under mechanical stress due to the continuously reorganizing cell cytoskeleton. In this review, we discuss the involvement of mechanical forces during antigen recognition by migrating T cells. We will explore this question from a conceptual and technical perspective, with the aim of providing new insights into the emerging field of mechanobiology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

abstract = {Biological mixtures such as the cytosol may consist of thousands of distinct components. There is now a substantial body of evidence showing that, under physiological conditions, intracellular mixtures can phase separate into spatially distinct regions with differing compositions. In this article we present numerical evidence indicating that such spontaneous compartmentalization exploits general features of the phase diagram of a multicomponent biomolecular mixture. In particular, we show that demixed domains are likely to segregate when the variance in the intermolecular interaction strengths exceeds a well-defined threshold. Multiple distinct phases are likely to become stable under very similar conditions, which can then be tuned to achieve multiphase coexistence. As a result, only minor adjustments to the composition of the cytosol or the strengths of the intermolecular interactions are needed to regulate the formation of different domains with specific compositions, implying that phase separation is a robust mechanism for creating spatial organization. We further predict that this functionality is only weakly affected by increasing the number of components in the system. Our model therefore suggests that, for purely physico-chemical reasons, biological mixtures are naturally poised to undergo a small number of demixing phase transitions.},

@article{Russo2010,
abstract = {We report simulations of a simple model of particles with limited valence in two dimensions and compare the numerical results with recent predictions based on the application of the Wertheim theory. The predictions for the fraction of formed bonds are rather accurate, except at low densities and temperatures, where enhanced bonding is found. Such differences are traced-back to the break-down of the approximation of absence of intra-cluster bonding. The enhanced bonding is thus attributed to the growing entropic cost of merging different clusters when the density is low, compared to the free-energy gain of forming an intra-cluster bond. The presence of closed bond loops in finite size clusters affects the location of the percolation locus, which is located at temperature lower than expected on the basis of the Flory-Stockmayer theory. Similarly, the critical region is shifted to temperatures smaller than the ones accessible with present time numerical resources, despite the implementation of efficient cluster moves. Only a weak evidence of a low-T gas-liquid phase separation between a very dilute gas phase and a low-density percolating liquid phase is found. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Supercapacitors (SCs) possess paramount importance and are a promising solution among the class of energy storage devices since they have appreciable features like higher specific power, longer life span, and eco-friendly nature. They replace the difference of energy/power between the high-power traditional capacitors and high energy fuel cells/ batteries. In the current review, comprehensive research on the recent literature of SCs investigates and elucidates with great consideration. The global market analysis, manufacturing firms, challenges, and recent advances present the fundamental, as well as application perspective of SCs. An elaborate analysis of the classifications of SCs, fabrication of different electrode materials from the very beginning of their evolution gives the lucid idea. The evaluation of SC nanocomposites with different parameters such as specific capacitance, energy density, power density, cycling performance, and capacity retention depicts the performance. Detail description of the selection of electrolytes and various synthesis methods of the SCs explains comprehensively. In the end, future scope and challenges mention briefly and consider for the next-generation SC's design and applications. This review provides a reference point on the SCs for researchers and designers working in the field of energy storage devices and applications.},

abstract = {High power electrical energy storage systems are becoming critical devices for advanced energy storage technology. This is true in part due to their high rate capabilities and moderate energy densities which allow them to capture power efficiently from evanescent, renewable energy sources. High power systems include both electrochemical capacitors and electrostatic capacitors. These devices have fast charging and discharging rates, supplying energy within seconds or less. Recent research has focused on increasing power and energy density of the devices using advanced materials and novel architectural design. An increase in understanding of structure-property relationships in nanomaterials and interfaces and the ability to control nanostructures precisely has led to an immense improvement in the performance characteristics of these devices. In this review, we discuss the recent advances for both electrochemical and electrostatic capacitors as high power electrical energy storage systems, and propose directions and challenges for the future. We asses the opportunities in nanostructure-based high power electrical energy storage devices and include electrochemical and electrostatic capacitors for their potential to open the door to a new regime of power energy. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies 2011.},

@article{Lian2020,
abstract = {The development of novel electrolytes and electrodes for supercapacitors is hindered by a gap of several orders of magnitude between experimentally measured and theoretically predicted charging time scales. Here, we propose an electrode model, containing many parallel stacked electrodes, that explains the slow charging dynamics of supercapacitors. At low applied potentials, the charging behavior of this model is described well by an equivalent circuit model. Conversely, at high potentials, charging dynamics slow down and evolve on two relaxation time scales: a generalized RC time and a diffusion time, which, interestingly, become similar for porous electrodes. The charging behavior of the stack-electrode model presented here helps to understand the charging dynamics of porous electrodes and qualitatively agrees with experimental time scales measured with porous electrodes.},

We perform a time-of-flight measurement of these fluctuations by cross-correlating current-time traces obtained at the two detectors.

Using high frequency ac voltage, the surface of such an electrode was etched to remove a very thin (â¥1-nm-thick) layer of Pt. The resulting zeptoliter-scale cavity inside the glass sheath was filled with aqueous solution containing redox species, and the etched electrode was immersed in a dry (no external solution) pool of mercury to produce a TLC. Several approaches based on steady-state voltammetry and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) were developed to independently evaluate the electrode radius and the etched volume. The number of redox molecules in the TLC could be varied between one and a few hundred by changing its volume and solution concentration. In this way, the transition between a random and deterministic number of trapped molecules was observed. High quality steady-state voltammograms of â¥1 molecules were obtained for different neutral and charged redox species and different concentrations of supporting electrolyte. The analysis of such voltammograms yields information about mass transfer, adsorption, electron transfer kinetics, and double-layer effects on the nanoscale.},

    "abstract": "Locally Robust (LR)/Orthogonal/Debiased moments have been proved useful with machine learning or high dimensional first steps, but their existence has not been investigated for general models and parameters. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition, referred to as Restricted Local Non-surjectivity (RLN), for the existence of such orthogonal moments to conduct robust inference on parameters of interest in regular semiparametric models. Importantly, RLN does not require identification of the parameters of interest or identification of the nuisance parameters. Thus, orthogonal moments exist under rather general conditions. However, for orthogonal moments to be informative for inference, the efficient Fisher Information matrix for the parameter must be non-zero (though possibly singular). We use these results to characterize the existence of orthogonal moments in a class of models with Unobserved Heterogeneity (UH), and to clarify the important role played by the support of UH for such characterization. Our results deliver functional differencing moments as a special case, and they also extend them to general functionals of UH. We also investigate existence of orthogonal moments and their relevance for models defined by moment restrictions with possibly different conditioning variables, and we characterize orthogonal moments for heterogenous parameters in treatment effects, for sample selection models, and for popular models of demand of differentiated products.",

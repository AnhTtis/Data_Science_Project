    "abstract": "The first main result presented in the paper shows that the perimeters of inner parallel sets of planar shapes having a given constant width are minimal for the Reuleaux triangles. This implies that the areas of inner parallel sets and, consequently, the inverse of the Cheeger constant are also minimal for the Reuleaux triangles. Proofs use elementary geometry arguments and are based on direct comparisons between general constant width shapes and the Reuleaux triangle.",

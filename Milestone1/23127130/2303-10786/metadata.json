    "abstract": "Anosov representations $ρ$ of a hyperbolic group $Γ$ into a semisimple Lie group $G$ are known to admit cocompact domains of discontinuity in flag varieties $G/Q$, endowing the compact quotient manifolds $M_ρ$ with a $(G,G/Q)$-structure. In general the topology of $M_ρ$ can be quite complicated.\n  In this article, we consider the case when $Γ$ is the fundamental group of a closed (real or complex) hyperbolic manifold $N$ and $ρ$ is a deformation of a (twisted) lattice embedding $Γ\\to \\mathrm{Isom}(\\mathbb H_\\mathbb K) \\to G$ through Anosov representations. We prove that, in this situation, $M_ρ$ is alway a smooth fiber bundle over $N$.\n  Determining the topology of the fiber seems hard in general. The second part of the paper focuses on the special case when $N$ is a surface, $ρ$ a quasi-Hitchin representation into $\\mathrm{Sp}(4,\\mathbb C)$, and $M_ρ$ is modelled on the space of complex Lagrangians in $\\mathbb C^4$. We show that, in this case, the fiber is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{CP}^2 \\sharp \\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}$.",

    "abstract": "Indian scientists began to work on the theoretical aspects of LHC physics from the early 1980s, at the same time when the rest of the world started taking interest in this then-futuristic topic. From this point grew a whole school of collider phenomenologists, who now form a significant fraction of the Indian high-energy physics community. This article briefly reviews the growth and contributions of the Indian school, on the way describing some of the physics ideas while placing the work in the international context, and proceeding thus, brings the story up to date in mid-2022.",

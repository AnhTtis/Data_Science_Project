\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\looseness=-1 The completion of this journey would not have been possible without the support and guidance of a great number of people. This thesis is dedicated to all of them.

First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors Florian Beutler and John Peacock. Florian's constant encouragement and advice from day one of my PhD studies enabled me to explore freely and pursue whichever research avenues I found interesting. I only met John in the middle of my PhD studies but his enthusiasm and wisdom were enough to act as a huge source of inspiration ever since. My supervisors allowed me to become the researcher that I am today and also showed me the kind of researcher that I want to become. It was a pleasure and privilege to learn from and work with them.

I am also extremely grateful to Alan Heavens and Ross McLure, for being the two examiners for my viva. Their keen interest in the subject along with their insightful questions turned the examination into a fascinating and very enjoyable debate. 

This thesis is but the last stage of a long journey that started more than twenty years ago. Therefore, I would like to deeply thank my family for their continuous support during all these years, and especially my father and grandfather for cultivating my love for science when I was really young. My gratitude extends to my mother, aunt, and grandmother that enabled my involvement in science at an early age, always providing access to books, lectures, telescopes, microscopes, and spare parts that I required for my ``little science experiments'', and of course to my brother for always being my ``lab assistant''.

Special thanks goes to all my friends for making this process easier and more enjoyable and especially to Jamie, Mike, Tasos and anyone else who traveled this path along with me.

A big thanks goes to my girlfriend Denia for her unconditional support and for believing in me during the past four years. Finally, I would like to thank my two cats, Poco and Gatoulis, for keeping me company and lightening my mood during this stressful period.

    \textsc{\LARGE Acknowledgment}\\
\end{center}

I would like to thank all those who in  the duality personal/academic life  (with lots of overlaps) have made this thesis possible. I would like to start by thanking my advisor Ignacio Araya and co-advisor Giorgos Anastasiou, for their support throughout the completion of this thesis. They were always willing to answer all of my questions. I also thank them for all the advice they have given me on academic, personal and other matters.

Another important participant in the development of this thesis (and in the process of my academic formation) is Rodrigo Olea. I thank him for welcoming me into his research group when I arrived to Chile and for always encouraging me to pursue an academic career even in times of crisis. 

I am deeply grateful to the physics department at ICEN, especially Cristóbal, Diego, José, Omar, Nelson Merino, and Patricio, for their invaluable assistance and support. To my classmates Carlos, Luis, Mayrim and Nelson Sánchez, thank you for the companionship and the experiences shared during my stay in Iquique.

These acknowledgements would not be complete without mentioning all the people in Peru whose great support I have always felt. I would like to thank Cristian, Fernando, Luis and Martin from the theoretical physics group at UNMSM. The discussions on physics and politics have always been fruitful. A big thank to my closest friends David, Jessica, Julio, Lale, Malu, Majo, Sandra and Sebastian for being there since before I decided to pursue a career in theoretical physics and for all your support along the way.

Special thanks to Teofilo Vargas, for introducing me to the world of theoretical physics and giving me the first glimpses into general relativity and field theory.

Last but not least, an immeasurable thanks to my family. To my parents, Gladys and Rolando, for always giving me the freedom to decide, to make mistakes and to learn. It is comforting to know that you will always be there for me no matter what. Also to my brother Omar and my sister Ara for teaching me the importance of dedication and concentration to achieve a goal.


Thanks to all of you, a part of this work is yours.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we studied a (cooperative) multi-agent constrained POMDP in the setting of infinite-horizon expected total discounted costs. We established strong duality and existence of a saddle point using an extension of Sion's Minimax Theorem which required giving a suitable topology to the space of all possible policy-profiles and then establishing lower semi-continuity of the Lagrangian function. The strong duality result provides a firm theoretical footing for future development of primal-dual type planning and learning algorithms for 
{MA}-C-POMDPs---see~\cite{khan2023cooperative} for one such algorithm. % Work in this direction is in progress.

\section{Comparison of Different Steganography Methods}
\label{suppl-sec:steg_comp}
\autoref{fig:table} compares \method{} with both learned methods like SteganoGAN~\citep{zhang2019steganogan} and CHAT-GAN~\citep{tan2021channel}, and optimization based methods methods like FNNS~\citep{kishore2021fixed}. We see that \method{} has a trained encoder like learned methods, but its learned encoder is iterative and emulates the optimization algorithm in optimization-based steganography methods.

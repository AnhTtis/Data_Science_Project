\section{Comparison with CHAT-GAN}
\label{appendix:chatgan}
 \citet{tan2021channel} present steganography results for hiding 1-4 bpp messages in images from the COCO dataset using CHAT-GAN.  We train \method{} using different $\lambda$ weights to match the error rates of CHAT-GAN (as listed in their paper) as closely as possible and the results are presented in \autoref{tab:chat}; we use $\lambda=100$ for 1-2 bpp and $\lambda=20$ for 3-4 bpp for training \method{}.
From the table, we see that the error rates and SSIM values are comparable for both methods, but CHAT-GAN obtains better PSNR numbers. This is likely due to the fact that CHAT-GAN has a specially designed feature attention module to hide bits imperceptibly. However, as evidenced by both the SSIM values and the qualitative images below, steganographic images from \method{} visually look indistinguishable from the cover images despite having lower PSNR values (PSNR is a local statistic and it measures the absolute mean squared difference in pixel values and two images can look similar despite have a low PSNR).
Moreover, note that the contributions of our paper are orthogonal to the contributions of \citet{tan2021channel}. We can also combine our iterative LISO method with the CHAT-GAN encoder network architecture~\citep{tan2021channel} to take advantage of both methods and to perform steganography with higher payloads and harder images.

% \method{} aids in achieving a low error rate on even hard datasets (like CelebA) and CHAT-GAN helps achieve high image quality. 
 % Both the SteganoGAN paper and the FNNS paper show that datasets like Div2k and CelebA pose more difficulty -- SteganoGAN attains 95\% accuracy on COCO but only 82\% on Div2k for hiding 4bpp, for example. Unfortunately, the code for CHAT-GAN is not available

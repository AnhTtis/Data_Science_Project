\section{Additional Qualitative Results}
\label{suppl-sec:imgs}
A few qualitative examples of steganographic images were presented in the main paper. Additional steganographic images produced by \method{} with 1-4bpp of hidden information are shown in \autoref{fig:more_images}. Stenographic images obtained with an increased mse weight $\lambda=10$ are shown in \autoref{fig:diff_mse}. 

As explained in the paper, we can use L-BFGS with \method{} to further reduce the error rate obtained from \method{}. \autoref{fig:lbfgs} shows steganographic images obtained from \method{}+L-BFGS and we see that there is no difference in visual quality even after the additional optimization. 

In \autoref{sec:experiments} of the main paper we show that \method{} can avoid being detected by SiaStegNet~\citep{you2020siamese} by using the gradient from SiaStegNet in \method{}'s optimization network.
In \autoref{fig:kenet_images}, we show sample images from the Div2k dataset that are generated in this way to avoid SiaStegNet detection. Again we see no noticeable difference in visual quality.

% We also show in the main paper that hiding information with LISO is resistant to JPEG compression if we add a differentible JPEG layer in the \method{} optimization.  In \autoref{fig:jpeg_images}, we show steganographic JPEG images obtained from doing so. It is indeed hard to conceal messages with JPEG compression without hurting image quality. We see that we get good results for 1bpp but for more than 1bpp the image quality is not very good. In the future, we are interested in exploring ways to find JPEG resistant steganographic images that are of better quality.

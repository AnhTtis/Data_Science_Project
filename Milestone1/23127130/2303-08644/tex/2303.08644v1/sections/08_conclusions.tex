\section{Conclusions}
In this work we have introduced RGI, a simple yet effective framework for self-supervised learning on graphs based on the principle of mutual information maximization between local and global representations. The objective function regularizes the covariance matrix of the representations to avoid the total and dimensional collapse. We have shown that, in spite of its simplicity and that it does not require training for too long, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets following the linear evaluation protocol on downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "It is known that if each point $x$ of a dynamical system is generic for some invariant measure $μ_x$, then there is a strong connection between certain ergodic and topological properties of that system. In particular, if the acting group is abelian and the map $x\\mapsto μ_x$ is continuous, then every orbit closure is uniquely ergodic.\n  In this note, we show that if the acting group is not abelian, orbit closures may well support more than one ergodic measure even if $x\\mapsto μ_x$ is continuous. We provide examples of such a situation via actions of the group of all orientation preserving homeomorphisms on the unit interval as well as the Lamplighter group. Moreover, we generalize several results concerning weakly mean equicontinuous group actions beyond the setting of countable discrete abelian/amenable groups.",

    "abstract": "Detecting hidden geometrical structures from surface measurements under electromagnetic, acoustic, or mechanical loading is the goal of noninvasive imaging techniques in medical and industrial applications. Solving the inverse problem can be challenging due to the unknown topology and geometry, the sparsity of the data, and the complexity of the physical laws. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise as a simple-yet-powerful tool for problem inversion, but they have yet to be applied to general problems with a priori unknown topology. Here, we introduce a topology optimization framework based on PINNs that solves geometry detection problems without prior knowledge of the number or types of shapes. We allow for arbitrary solution topology by representing the geometry using a material density field that approaches binary values thanks to a novel eikonal regularization. We validate our framework by detecting the number, locations, and shapes of hidden voids and inclusions in linear and nonlinear elastic bodies using measurements of outer surface displacement from a single mechanical loading experiment. Our methodology opens a pathway for PINNs to solve various engineering problems targeting geometry optimization.",

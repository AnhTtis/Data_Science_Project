Given a monocular video with a SMPL parametric body fit, our method quickly reconstructs a 3D model of the person in canonical pose using a factorized radiance field representation~\cite{tensorf}. Then, it extracts a tight rigged mesh and uses a new local ray-marching render which, without baking or otherwise converting the radiance field, can render the dynamic human on a consumer VR device at 40FPS. Videos and demos are available at \url{https://real-time-humans.github.io/}.\label{fig:teaser}}

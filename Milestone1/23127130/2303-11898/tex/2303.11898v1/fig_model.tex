\caption{\textbf{Overview of the proposed method.}
During training, we shoot rays from the training cameras onto the scene and sample points withing the bounding box of the parametric human body mesh.
Points which are close to the mesh are warped to canonical space via inverse linear-blend-skinning (LBS), where the factorized volumetric representation is sampled for density and color, and whose values are used to perform raymarching.
After training, a canonical mesh is extracted from the learnt factorized volumetric representation. For real-time rendering, the canonical mesh is posed, rasterized, and used to guide the inverse skinning and local raymarching.}%

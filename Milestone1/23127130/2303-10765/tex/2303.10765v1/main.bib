abstract = {Abstract The information overload on the World Wide Web results in the underuse of some existing e-government services within the business domain. Small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), in particular, are seeking “one-to-one'' e-services from government in current highly competitive markets, and there is an imperative need to develop Web personalization techniques to provide business users with information and services specific to their needs, rather than an undifferentiated mass of information. This paper focuses on how e-governments can support businesses on the problem of selecting a trustworthy business partner to perform reliable business transactions. In the business partner selection process, trust or reputation information is crucial and has significant influence on a business user's decision regarding whether or not to do business with other business entities. For this purpose, an intelligent trust-enhanced recommendation approach to provide personalized government-to-business (G2B) e-services, and in particular, business partner recommendation e-services for SMBs is proposed. Accordingly, in this paper, we develop (1) an implicit trust filtering recommendation approach and (2) an enhanced user-based collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation approach. To further exploit the advantages of the two proposed approaches, we develop (3) a hybrid trust-enhanced CF recommendation approach (TeCF) that integrates both the proposed implicit trust filtering and the enhanced user-based CF recommendation approaches. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, especially the hybrid TeCF recommendation approach in terms of improving accuracy, as well as in dealing with very sparse data sets and cold-start users. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This study incorporates additional information from the users' social trust network and the items' semantic domain knowledge to alleviate these problems. It proposes an innovative Trust–Semantic Fusion (TSF)-based recommendation approach within the CF framework. Experiments demonstrate that the TSF approach significantly outperforms existing recommendation algorithms in terms of recommendation accuracy and coverage when dealing with the above problems. A business-to-business recommender system case study validates the applicability of the TSF approach."

abstract = {Trust models have received considerable attention in the recent past and have been employed in many of today's most successful recommender systems (RSs) for alleviating sparsity by enhancing their interuser connectivity obtained from historical preference data and to address the cold start problem. However, the incorporation of distrust in addition to trust for improved recommendations has not been analyzed fully because of the absence of publically available data sets containing gradual information about trust and distrust concepts. Our work in this paper is an attempt toward introducing recommendation strategies exploiting both the trust and the distrust in the RSs to further enhance their quality of recommendations through fuzzy computational models for trust and distrust. Since trust and distrust concepts are gradual phenomenon, therefore these can be represented more naturally by fuzzy logic using linguistic expressions. The contributions of this paper are three fold: First, we propose fuzzy computational models for both the trust and distrust concepts through similarity as well as knowledge factors based on linguistic expressions. Second, we suggest appropriate propagation and aggregation operators to deal with the data sparsity. Finally, we present a comparative analysis of proposed recommendation strategies utilizing both the trust and distrust concepts.},

abstract = "Trust and reputation systems represent a significant trend in decision support for Internet mediated service provision. The basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party to derive a trust or reputation score, which can assist other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with that party in the future. A natural side effect is that it also provides an incentive for good behaviour, and therefore tends to have a positive effect on market quality. Reputation systems can be called collaborative sanctioning systems to reflect their collaborative nature, and are related to collaborative filtering systems. Reputation systems are already being used in successful commercial online applications. There is also a rapidly growing literature around trust and reputation systems, but unfortunately this activity is not very coherent. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of existing and proposed systems that can be used to derive measures of trust and reputation for Internet transactions, to analyse the current trends and developments in this area, and to propose a research agenda for trust and reputation systems."

Since most current efforts lack an exploration of a comprehensive adversary model, we try to fill in this gap by providing a thorough view of the various credibility threats against a decentralized reputation system and the respective defense mechanisms. Therefore, we explore and classify the types of potential attacks against reputation systems for P2P applications. We also study and classify the defense mechanisms which have been proposed for each type of attack and identify conflicts between defense mechanisms and/or desirable characteristics of credible reputations systems. We finally propose a roadmap for reputation system designers on how to use the results of our survey for the design of robust reputation systems for P2P applications."

As most entities will not have any direct experience of other entities, they must increasingly come to rely on reputation systems. Such systems allow the prediction who is likely to be trustworthy based on feedback from past transactions. In this paper we introduce a new taxonomy for reputation systems, along with: a reference model for reputation context, a model of reputation systems, a substantial survey, and a comparison of existing reputation research and deployed reputation systems."

RATEWeb supports a cooperative model in which Web services share their experiences of the service providers with their peers through feedback ratings. The different ratings are aggregated to derive a service provider's reputation. This in turn is used to evaluate trust. The overall goal of RATEWeb is to facilitate trust-based selection and composition of Web services. We propose a set of decentralized techniques that aim at accurately aggregating the submitted ratings for reputation assessment. We conduct experiments to assess the fairness and accuracy of the proposed techniques.",

abstract = "Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking is widely used to exchange, contribute, or obtain files from any participating user. Building trust relationships between peers in a large-scale distributed P2P file-sharing system is a fundamental and challenging research topic. However, it is difficult to build a good trust relationship with the traditional mechanism. Recommendation based trust model from social relationship can be adopted to resolve the problem. But it faces the challenges of subjectivity, and experiential referral weighting. This paper presents R2Trust—a robust Reputation and Risk evaluation based Trust management model. Our novel framework uses both reputation and risk to evaluate the trustworthiness of a peer and it is applicable for unstructured P2P networks. The model will evaluate peer trust values from direct interactions and peers referrals. R2Trust also distinguishes the credibility of peers. As a result, the aggregated trust value will filter out the noises and reflect more accurate trust values. The proposed R2Trust can also defense against several malicious attacks, such as simple malicious attacks, collusive attacks, and strategic attacks. Our experimental results show that, compared to the existing trust models, our model is cleanly a winner when security is the major concern of a system."

Research in this area to date has focused on analyzing the effectiveness of single-type systems, while less attention has been paid to the comparison of different systems. This paper proposes an analysis model that can classify and measure different reputation systems in the same context. The model divides reputation systems into five underlying components: input, processing, output, feedback loop and storage. A series of benchmark criteria is then defined based on the characteristics of each component. The model comprehensively analyzes most characteristics of centralized reputation systems and it takes both performance and costs of systems into consideration."

We draw on well-established theories of audience behavior to argue that the online fake news audience, like most niche content, would be a small subset of the total news audience, especially those with high availability. By examining online visitation data across mobile and desktop platforms in the months leading up to and following the 2016 presidential election, we indeed find the fake news audience comprises a small, disloyal group of heavy Internet users. We also find that social network sites play an outsized role in generating traffic to fake news. With this revised understanding, we revisit the democratic implications of the fake news crisis. }

This paper builds upon previous research by analyzing the arguments proffered on anti-vaccination websites, determining the extent of misinformation present, and examining discourses used to support vaccine objections. Arguments around the themes of safety and effectiveness, alternative medicine, civil liberties, conspiracy theories, and morality were found on the majority of websites analyzed; misinformation was also prevalent. The most commonly proposed method of combating this misinformation is through better education, although this has proven ineffective. Education does not consider the discourses supporting vaccine rejection, such as those involving alternative explanatory models of health, interpretations of parental responsibility, and distrust of expertise. Anti-vaccination protestors make postmodern arguments that reject biomedical and scientific “facts” in favour of their own interpretations. Pro-vaccination advocates who focus on correcting misinformation reduce the controversy to merely an “educational” problem; rather, these postmodern discourses must be acknowledged in order to begin a dialogue."

abstract="The paper explores the use of concepts in cognitive psychology to evaluate the spread of misinformation, disinformation and propaganda in online social networks. Analysing online social networks to identify metrics to infer cues of deception will enable us to measure diffusion of misinformation. The cognitive process involved in the decision to spread information involves answering four main questions viz consistency of message, coherency of message, credibility of source and general acceptability of message. We have used the cues of deception to analyse these questions to obtain solutions for preventing the spread of misinformation. We have proposed an algorithm to effectively detect deliberate spread of false information which would enable users to make informed decisions while spreading information in social networks. The computationally efficient algorithm uses the collaborative filtering property of social networks to measure the credibility of sources of information as well as quality of news items. The validation of the proposed methodology has been done on the online social network `Twitter'.",

Through a massive analysis on 920 news outlets and 376 million users, we explore the anatomy of news consumption on Facebook on a global scale. We show that users tend to confine their attention on a limited set of pages, thus determining a sharp community structure among news outlets. Furthermore, our findings suggest that users have a more cosmopolitan perspective of the information space than news providers. We conclude with a simple model of selective exposure that well reproduces the observed connectivity patterns.The advent of social media and microblogging platforms has radically changed the way we consume information and form opinions. In this paper, we explore the anatomy of the information space on Facebook by characterizing on a global scale the news consumption patterns of 376 million users over a time span of 6 y (January 2010 to December 2015). We find that users tend to focus on a limited set of pages, producing a sharp community structure among news outlets. We also find that the preferences of users and news providers differ. By tracking how Facebook pages {\textquotedblleft}like{\textquotedblright} each other and examining their geolocation, we find that news providers are more geographically confined than users.

abstract = {ABSTRACT This research surveys the current state-of-the-art technologies that are instrumental in the adoption and development of fake news detection. “Fake news detection” is defined as the task of categorizing news along a continuum of veracity, with an associated measure of certainty. Veracity is compromised by the occurrence of intentional deceptions. The nature of online news publication has changed, such that traditional fact checking and vetting from potential deception is impossible against the flood arising from content generators, as well as various formats and genres. The paper provides a typology of several varieties of veracity assessment methods emerging from two major categories – linguistic cue approaches (with machine learning), and network analysis approaches. We see promise in an innovative hybrid approach that combines linguistic cue and machine learning, with network-based behavioral data. Although designing a fake news detector is not a straightforward problem, we propose operational guidelines for a feasible fake news detecting system.},

In a December poll, 64 percent of U.S. adults said that {``}made-up news{''} has caused a {``}great deal of confusion{''} about the facts of current events (Barthel et al., 2016). Fabricated stories in social media, ranging from deliberate propaganda to hoaxes and satire, contributes to this confusion in addition to having serious effects on global stability. In this work we build predictive models to classify 130 thousand news posts as suspicious or verified, and predict four sub-types of suspicious news {--} satire, hoaxes, clickbait and propaganda. We show that neural network models trained on tweet content and social network interactions outperform lexical models. Unlike previous work on deception detection, we find that adding syntax and grammar features to our models does not improve performance. Incorporating linguistic features improves classification results, however, social interaction features are most informative for finer-grained separation between four types of suspicious news posts.",

abstract = {This paper furthers the development of methods to distinguish truth from deception in textual data. We use rhetorical structure theory (RST) as the analytic framework to identify systematic differences between deceptive and truthful stories in terms of their coherence and structure. A sample of 36 elicited personal stories, self-ranked as truthful or deceptive, is manually analyzed by assigning RST discourse relations among each story's constituent parts. A vector space model (VSM) assesses each story's position in multidimensional RST space with respect to its distance from truthful and deceptive centers as measures of the story's level of deception and truthfulness. Ten human judges evaluate independently whether each story is deceptive and assign their confidence levels (360 evaluations total), producing measures of the expected human ability to recognize deception. As a robustness check, a test sample of 18 truthful stories (with 180 additional evaluations) is used to determine the reliability of our RST-VSM method in determining deception. The contribution is in demonstration of the discourse structure analysis as a significant method for automated deception detection and an effective complement to lexicosemantic analysis. The potential is in developing novel discourse-based tools to alert information users to potential deception in computer-mediated texts.},

Alongside these promising features, however, comes the threat of misinformation propagation which can lead to undesirable effects. Due to the sheer number of online social network (OSN) users and the highly clustered structures commonly shared by these kinds of networks, there is a substantial challenge to efficiently contain viral spread of misinformation in large-scale social networks. In this paper, we focus on how to limit viral propagation of misinformation in OSNs. Particularly, we study a set of problems, namely the βTI-Node Protectors problems, which aim to find the smallest set of highly influential nodes from which disseminating good information helps to contain the viral spread of misinformation, initiated from a set of nodes I, within a desired fraction (1-β) of the nodes in the entire network in T time steps. For this family of problems, we analyze and present solutions including their inapproximability results, greedy algorithms that provide better lower bounds on the number of selected nodes, and a community-based method for solving these problems. We further conduct a number of experiments on real-world traces, and the empirical results show that our proposed methods outperform existing alternative approaches in finding those important nodes that can help to contain the spread of misinformation effectively."

In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of identifying rumors, i.e., fake information, out of microblog posts based on their propagation structure. We firstly model microblog posts diffusion with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how an original message is transmitted and developed over time. We then propose a kernel-based method called Propagation Tree Kernel, which captures high-order patterns differentiating different types of rumors by evaluating the similarities between their propagation tree structures. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed kernel-based approach can detect rumors more quickly and accurately than state-of-the-art rumor detection models.",

    "abstract": "It was recently discovered that a crystalline many-body state can exist in\nthe phase space of a closed dynamical system. Phase space crystal can be\nanomalous Chern insulator that supports chiral topological transport without\nbreaking physical time-reversal symmetry [L. Guo et al., Phys. Rev. B 105,\n094301 (2022)]. In this work, we further study the effects of open dissipative\nenvironment with thermal noise, and identify the existence condition of\nclassical phase space crystals in realistic scenarios. By defining a crystal\norder parameter, we plot the phase diagram in the parameter space of\ndissipation rate, interaction and temperature. Our present work paves the way\nto realise phase space crystals and explore anomalous chiral transport in\nexperiments.",

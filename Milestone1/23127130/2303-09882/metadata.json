    "abstract": "We present a strongly conservative and pressure-robust hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the coupled time-dependent Navier-Stokes and Darcy problem. We show existence and uniqueness of a solution and present an optimal a priori error analysis for the fully discrete problem when using Backward Euler time stepping. The theoretical results are verified by numerical examples.",

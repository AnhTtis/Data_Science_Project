    "abstract": "Supernova remnants act as particle accelerators, providing the cosmic-ray protons that permeate the interstellar medium and initiate the ion-molecule reactions that drive interstellar chemistry. Enhanced fluxes of cosmic-ray protons in close proximity to supernova remnants have been inferred from observations tracing particle interactions with nearby molecular gas. Here I present observations of H$_3^+$ and CO absorption, molecules that serve as tracers of the cosmic-ray ionization rate and gas density, respectively, in sight lines toward the W28 and Vela supernova remnants. Cosmic-ray ionization rates inferred from these observations range from about 2--10 times the average value in Galactic diffuse clouds ($\\sim 3\\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$), suggesting that the gas being probed is experiencing an elevated particle flux. While it is difficult to constrain the line-of-sight location of the absorbing gas with respect to the supernova remnants, these results are consistent with a scenario where cosmic rays are diffusing away from the acceleration site and producing enhanced ionization rates in the surrounding medium.",

    "abstract": "In this study, an optimization model for offline scheduling policy of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is proposed to improve the decoding efficiency of the belief propagation (BP). The optimization model uses the number of messages passed (NMP) as a metric to evaluate complexity, and two metrics, average entropy (AE), and gap to maximum a posteriori (GAP), to evaluate BP decoding performance. Based on this model, an algorithm is proposed to optimize the scheduling sequence for reduced decoding complexity and superior performance compared to layered BP. Furthermore, this proposed algorithm does not add the extra complexity of determining the scheduling sequence to the decoding process.",

  abstract = {Although IEEE 754-2008 binary128 (with a 15-bit exponent and 113-bit significand, i.e., quadruple-precision) is not currently implemented on x86 in hardware, software emulation is available on some compilers. However, the performance is significantly slower compared to the binary64 operation, which is supported natively in hardware. This study proposes a fast implementation of matrix multiplication on matrices stored in the binary128 format on x86 CPUs. The proposed implementation utilizes the Ozaki scheme, which is an accurate matrix multiplication algorithm proposed by Ozaki et al. in 2012. This scheme enables one to perform most computations using the binary64 matrix multiplication (the DGEMM routine in Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)); it can exploit the high-performance of highly-optimized vendor BLAS. Although the achievable performance depends on the input matrices (the inner-product dimension, the absolute range, and the significand bit length), the proposed implementation can achieve better performance and accuracy compared to naive matrix multiplication performed using the GCC's binary128 emulation in many cases. In addition, we discuss GPU acceleration, performance on reduced precision inputs, an implementation based on binary32 matrix multiplication (SGEMM), application to memory-intensive operations, and the possibility of a distributed parallel implementation.},

This law relates the flux of energy (angular momentum) radiated to null infinity and through the event horizon to the local change in the secondary's orbital energy (angular momentum) for generic (non-resonant) bound orbits in Kerr spacetime. As an explicit example we compute these quantities for a spin-aligned body moving on a circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We perform this calculation both analytically, via a high-order post-Newtonian expansion, and numerically in two different gauges. Using these results we demonstrate explicitly that our new balance law holds.},

  abstract = {A new algorithm is developed for computing \$e\^\{tA\}B\$, where A is an \$n\textbackslash times n\$ matrix and B is \$n\textbackslash times n\_0\$ with \$n\_0 \textbackslash ll n\$. The algorithm works for any A, its computational cost is dominated by the formation of products of A with \$n\textbackslash times n\_0\$ matrices, and the only input parameter is a backward error tolerance. The algorithm can return a single matrix \$e\^\{tA\}B\$ or a sequence \$e\^\{t\_kA\}B\$ on an equally spaced grid of points \$t\_k\$. It uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential. It determines the amount of scaling and the Taylor degree using the recent analysis of Al-Mohy and Higham [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 31 (2009), pp. 970\textendash 989], which provides sharp truncation error bounds expressed in terms of the quantities \$\textbackslash |A\^k\textbackslash |\^\{1/k\}\$ for a few values of k, where the norms are estimated using a matrix norm estimator. Shifting and balancing are used as preprocessing steps to reduce the cost of the algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm performs in a numerically stable fashion across a wide range of problems, and analysis of rounding errors and of the conditioning of the problem provides theoretical support. Experimental comparisons with MATLAB codes based on Krylov subspace, Chebyshev polynomial, and Laguerre polynomial methods show the new algorithm to be sometimes much superior in terms of computational cost and accuracy. An important application of the algorithm is to exponential integrators for ordinary differential equations. It is shown that the sums of the form \$\textbackslash sum\_\{k=0\}\^p \textbackslash varphi\_k(A)u\_k\$ that arise in exponential integrators, where the \$\textbackslash varphi\_k\$ are related to the exponential function, can be expressed in terms of a single exponential of a matrix of dimension \$n+p\$ built by augmenting A with additional rows and columns, and the algorithm of this paper can therefore be employed.},

This prediction is verified using numerical time evolutions of the Teukolsky equation. We argue that the observed behavior can be understood in terms of the presence of a ``superradiance resonance cavity'' immediately outside the black hole, and discuss whether it may be relevant for astrophysical black holes.},

The -dependent asymptotics on Kerr spacetimes differ significantly from the non-rotating Schwarzschild setting (``Price's law''). The main differences with Schwarzschild are slower decay rates for higher angular frequencies and oscillations along the null generators of the event horizon. We introduce a physical space-based method that resolves the following two main difficulties for establishing -dependent asymptotics in the Kerr setting: 1) the coupling of angular modes and 2) a loss of ellipticity in the ergoregion. Our mechanism identifies and exploits the existence of conserved charges along null infinity via a time invertibility theory, which in turn relies on new elliptic estimates in the full black hole exterior. This framework is suitable for resolving the conflicting numerology in Kerr late-time asymptotics that appears in the numerics literature.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a spectral decomposition of solutions to relativistic wave equations described on horizon penetrating hyperboloidal slices within a given Schwarzschild-black-hole background. The wave equa- tion in question is Laplace-transformed which leads to a spatial differential equation with a complex parameter. For initial data which are analytic with respect to a compactified spatial coordinate, this equation is treated with the help of the Mathematica-package in terms of a sophisticated Taylor series analysis. Thereby, all ingredients of the desired spectral decomposition arise explicitly to arbitrarily prescribed accuracy, including quasi normal modes, quasi normal mode amplitudes as well as the jump of the Laplace-transform along the branch cut. Finally, all contributions are put together to obtain via the inverse Laplace transformation the spectral de- composition in question. The paper explains extensively this procedure and includes detailed discussions of relevant aspects, such as the definition of quasi normal modes and the question regarding the contribution of infinity frequencies modes to the early time response of the black hole.},

In this approach, the GSF is computed directly from a certain scalarlike self-potential that satisfies the time-domain Teukolsky equation on the Kerr background. The approach is computationally much cheaper than existing time-domain methods, which rely on a direct integration of the linearized Einstein's equations and are impaired by mode instabilities. At the same time, it retains the utility and flexibility of a time-domain treatment, allowing calculations for any type of orbit (including highly eccentric or unbound ones) and the possibility of self-consistently evolving the orbit under the effect of the GSF. Here we formulate our method, and present a first numerical application, for circular geodesic orbits in Schwarzschild geometry. We discuss further applications.},

The resulting Hamiltonian is in complete agreement with corresponding terms in state-of-the-art expressions at fourth post-Newtonian order as well as the probe limit at all orders in velocity.

  abstract = {The Fokker action governing the motion of compact binary systems without spins is derived in harmonic coordinates at the fourth post-Newtonian approximation (4PN) of general relativity. Dimensional regularization is used for treating the local ultraviolet (UV) divergences associated with point particles, followed by a renormalization of the poles into a redefinition of the trajectories of the point masses. Effects at the 4PN order associated with wave tails propagating at infinity are included consistently at the level of the action. A finite part procedure based on analytic continuation deals with the infrared (IR) divergencies at spatial infinity, which are shown to be fully consistent with the presence of near zone tails. Our end result at 4PN order is Lorentz invariant and has the correct self-force limit for the energy of circular orbits. However, we find that it differs from the recently published result derived within the ADM Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity [T. Damour, P. Jaranowski, and G. Scha\textasciidieresis fer, Phys. Rev. D 89, 064058 (2014)]. More work is needed to understand this discrepancy.},

We discuss these Laplacians both in the Newman-Penrose formalism and in the Geroch-Held-Penrose variant for an arbitrary vacuum spacetime. Perturbative expansion of these wave equations results in a recursive scheme valid for higher orders. This approach, apart from the obvious implications for the gravitational and electromagnetic wave propagation on a curved spacetime, explains and extends the results in the literature for perturbative analysis by clarifying their true origins in the exact theory.},

  abstract = {Extreme and very-near-extreme spin J Kerr black holes have been conjectured to be holographically dual to two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFTs) with left and right central charges c\_L=c\_R=12J. In this paper it is observed that the 2D conformal symmetry of the scalar wave equation at low frequencies persists for generic non-extreme values of the mass M. Interestingly, this conformal symmetry is not derived from a conformal symmetry of the spacetime geometry except in the extreme limit. The periodic identification of the azimuthal angle is shown to correspond to a spontaneous breaking of the conformal symmetry by left and right temperatures (T\_L,T\_R). The well-known low-frequency scalar-Kerr scattering amplitudes coincide with correlators of a 2D CFT at these temperatures. Moreover the CFT microstate degeneracy inferred from the Cardy formula agrees exactly with the Bekenstein-Hawking area law for all M and J. These observations provide evidence for the conjecture that the Kerr black hole is dual to a c\_L=c\_R=12J 2D CFT at temperatures (T\_L,T\_R) for every value of M and J.},

We express the equations in a suitable double null gauge. To obtain decay, one must in fact add a residual pure gauge solution which we prove to be itself quantitatively controlled from initial data. Our result a fortiori includes decay statements for general solutions of the Teukolsky equation (satisfied by gauge-invariant null-decomposed curvature components). These latter statements are in fact deduced in the course of the proof by exploiting associated quantities shown to satisfy the Regge\textendash Wheeler equation, for which appropriate decay can be obtained easily by adapting previous work on the linear scalar wave equation. The bounds on the rate of decay to linearised Kerr are inverse polynomial, suggesting that dispersion is sufficient to control the non-linearities of the Einstein equations in a potential future proof of nonlinear stability. This paper is self-contained and includes a physical-space derivation of the equations of linearised gravity around Schwarzschild from the full non-linear Einstein vacuum equations expressed in a double null gauge.},

As noted previously by Conlon and Herdeiro, for electron number densities \$n\_e\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-3\}\$ cm\$\^\{-3\}\$ (such as those measured in the interstellar medium) the effective mass induced by the plasma is \$\textbackslash mu \textbackslash sim 10\^\{-12\}\$ eV. This would cause superradiant instabilities for spinning black holes of a few tens of solar masses. An obvious problem with this picture is that densities in the vicinity of black holes are much higher than in the interstellar medium because of accretion. We have conducted numerical simulations of the superradiant instability in spinning black holes surrounded by a plasma with density increasing closer to the black hole, in order to mimic the effect of accretion. While we confirm that superradiant instabilities appear for plasma densities that are sufficiently low near the black hole, we find that astrophysically realistic accretion disks are unlikely to trigger such instabilities.},

  abstract = {This is the third in a series of papers aimed at developing a practical time-domain method for self-force calculations in Kerr spacetime. The key elements of the method are (i) removal of a singular part of the perturbation field with a suitable analytic "puncture", (ii) decomposition of the perturbation equations in azimuthal (\$m\$-)modes, taking advantage of the axial symmetry of the Kerr background, (iii) numerical evolution of the individual \$m\$-modes in 2+1-dimensions with a finite difference scheme, and (iv) reconstruction of the local self-force from the mode sum. Here we report a first implementation of the method to compute the gravitational self-force. We work in the Lorenz gauge, solving directly for the metric perturbation in 2+1-dimensions. The modes \$m=0,1\$ contain nonradiative pieces, whose time-domain evolution is hampered by certain gauge instabilities. We study this problem in detail and propose ways around it. In the current work we use the Schwarzschild geometry as a platform for development; in a forthcoming paper---the fourth in the series---we apply our method to the gravitational self-force in Kerr geometry.},

  abstract = {In the context of metric perturbation theory for non-spinning black holes, extreme mass ratio binary (EMRB) systems are described by distributionally forced master wave equations. Numerical solution of a master wave equation as an initial boundary value problem requires initial data. However, because the correct initial data for generic-orbit systems is unknown, specification of trivial initial data is a common choice, despite being inconsistent and resulting in a solution which is initially discontinuous in time. As is well known, this choice leads to a "burst" of junk radiation which eventually propagates off the computational domain. We observe another unintended consequence of trivial initial data: development of a persistent spurious solution, here referred to as the Jost junk solution, which contaminates the physical solution for long times. This work studies the influence of both types of junk on metric perturbations, waveforms, and self-force measurements, and it demonstrates that smooth modified source terms mollify the Jost solution and reduce junk radiation. Our concluding section discusses the applicability of these observations to other numerical schemes and techniques used to solve distributionally forced master wave equations.},

We show that WENO methods outperform higher-order finite-difference methods, standard in the discretization of the Teukolsky equation, due to the need to add dissipation for stability purposes in the latter. In particular, as the WENO scheme uses no additional dissipation, it is well suited for scenarios requiring long-time evolution such as the study of price tails and gravitational wave emission from extreme mass ratio binaries. In the mixed-precision approach, the expensive computation of the WENO weights is performed in reduced floating-point precision that results in a significant speedup factor of \$\$\textbackslash approx 3.3\$\$. In addition, we use state-of-the-art Nvidia general-purpose graphics processing units and cluster parallelism to further accelerate the WENO computations. Our optimized WENO solver can be used to quickly generate accurate results of significance in the field of black hole and gravitational wave physics. We apply our solver to study the behavior of the Aretakis charge\textemdash a conserved quantity, that if detected by a gravitational wave observatory like LIGO/Virgo would prove the existence of extremal black holes.},

We highlight the key role that the so-called algebraically special solutions play in the black hole Darboux theory and show that a similar relation exists between the Chandrasekhar-Detweiler equations for Kerr perturbations.

Considering an extreme Kerr black hole, we show that the large number of virtually undamped quasinormal modes (that exist for nonzero values of the azimuthal eigenvalue m) combine in such a way that the field (as observed at infinity) oscillates with an amplitude that decays as 1/t at late times. This is in clear contrast to the standard late time power-law falloff familiar from studies of nonrotating black holes. This long-lived oscillating ``tail'' will, however, not be present for nonextreme (presumably more astrophysically relevant) black holes, for which we find that many quasinormal modes (individually excited to a very small amplitude) combine to give rise to an exponentially decaying field. At very late times this slowly damped quasinormal-mode signal gives way to the standard power-law tail (corresponding to a mixture of multipoles depending on the initial data). These results could have implications for the detection of gravitational-wave signals from rapidly spinning black holes, since the required theoretical templates need to be constructed from linear combinations of many modes. Our main results are obtained analytically, but we support the conclusions with numerical time evolutions of the Teukolsky equation. These time evolutions provide an interesting insight into the notion that the quasinormal modes can be viewed as waves trapped in the spacetime region outside the horizon. They also suggest that a plausible mechanism for the behavior we observe for extreme black holes is the presence of a ``superradiance resonance cavity'' immediately outside the black hole.},

  abstract = {We prove the linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes as solutions of the Einstein vacuum equation: linearized perturbations of a Kerr metric decay at an inverse polynomial rate to a linearized Kerr metric plus a pure gauge term. We work in a natural wave map/DeTurck gauge and show that the pure gauge term can be taken to lie in a fixed 7-dimensional space with a simple geometric interpretation. Our proof rests on a robust general framework, based on recent advances in microlocal analysis and non-elliptic Fredholm theory, for the analysis of resolvents of operators on asymptotically flat spaces. With the mode stability of the Schwarzschild metric as well as of certain scalar and 1-form wave operators on the Schwarzschild spacetime as an input, we establish the linear stability of slowly rotating Kerr black holes using perturbative arguments; in particular, our proof does not make any use of special algebraic properties of the Kerr metric. The heart of the paper is a detailed description of the resolvent of the linearization of a suitable hyperbolic gauge-fixed Einstein operator at low energies. As in previous work by the second and third authors on the nonlinear stability of cosmological black holes, constraint damping plays an important role. Here, it eliminates certain pathological generalized zero energy states; it also ensures that solutions of our hyperbolic formulation of the linearized Einstein equation have the stated asymptotics and decay for general initial data and forcing terms, which is a useful feature in nonlinear and numerical applications.},

Such a formula will be useful in modelling precessing systems. We also provide a comprehensive description of the oscillations in the ringdown frequency in an inertial frame where the spin of the final black hole is in the \$z\$-direction. These oscillations arise due to the superposition of the prograde and retrograde frequencies. Our understanding of these oscillations can be used to extract the ratio of the amplitudes of the prograde and retrograde frequencies from numerical data. Alternatively, knowledge of this ratio of the amplitudes can be used to produce a simple model of the time domain oscillations in the ringdown frequency.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach to solve the 2+1 Teukolsky equation for gravitational perturbations of a Kerr black hole. Our approach relies on a new horizon penetrating, hyperboloidal foliation of Kerr spacetime and spatial compactification. In particular, we present a framework for waveform generation from point-particle perturbations. Extensive tests of a time domain implementation in the Teukode code are presented. The code can efficiently deliver waveforms at future null infinity. The accuracy and convergence of the waveforms' phase and amplitude is demonstrated. As a first application of the method, we compute the gravitational waveforms from inspiraling and coalescing black-hole binaries in the large-mass-ratio limit. The smaller mass black hole is modeled as a point particle whose dynamics is driven by an effective-one-body-resummed analytical radiation reaction force. We compare the analytical, mechanical angular momentum loss (computed using two different prescriptions) to the gravitational wave angular momentum flux. We find that higher-order post-Newtonian corrections are needed to improve the consistency for rapidly spinning binaries. We characterize the multipolar waveform as a function of the black-hole spin. Close to merger, the subdominant multipolar amplitudes (notably the m = 0 ones) are enhanced for retrograde orbits with respect to prograde ones. We argue that this effect mirrors nonnegligible deviations from the circularity of the dynamics during the late-plunge and merger phase. For the first time, we compute the gravitational wave energy flux flowing into the black hole during the inspiral using a time-domain formalism proposed by Poisson. Finally, a self-consistent, iterative method to compute the gravitational wave fluxes at leading-order in the mass of the particle is developed. The method can be used alternatively to the analytical radiation reaction in cases where the analytical information is poor or not sufficient. Specifically, we apply it to compute dynamics and waveforms for a rapidly rotating black hole with dimensionless spin parameter . For this case, the simulation with the consistent flux differs from the one with the analytical flux by gravitational wave cycles over a total of about 250 cycles. In this simulation the horizon absorption accounts for about gravitational wave cycles.},

  abstract = {We study axisymmetric solution to the conformally invariant wave equation on a Kerr background by means of numerical and analytical methods. Our main focus is on the behaviour of the solutions near spacelike infinity, which is appropriately represented as a cylinder. Earlier studies of the wave equation on a Schwarzschild background have revealed important details about the regularity of the corresponding solutions. It was found that, on the cylinder, the solutions generically develop logarithmic singularities at infinitely many orders. Moreover, these singularities also `spread' to future null infinity. However, by imposing certain regularity conditions on the initial data, the lowest-order singularities can be removed. Here we are interested in a generalisation of these results to a rotating black hole background and study the influence of the rotation rate on the properties of the solutions. To this aim, we first construct a conformal compactification of the Kerr solution which yields a suitable representation of the cylinder at spatial infinity. Besides analytical investigations on the cylinder, we numerically solve the wave equation with a fully pseudospectral method, which allows us to obtain highly accurate numerical solutions. This is crucial for a detailed analysis of the regularity of the solutions. In the Schwarzschild case, the numerical problem could effectively be reduced to solving (1 + 1)-dimensional equations. Here we present a code that can perform the full 2 + 1 evolution as required for axisymmetric waves on a Kerr background.},

Symmetric hyperbolic systems are shown to render the initial boundary value problem well-posed with maximally dissipative boundary conditions. I discuss the Laplace-Fourier method for analyzing the initial boundary value problem. Finally I state how these notions extend to systems that are first order in time and second order in space. In the second lecture I discuss the effect that the gauge freedom of electromagnetism has on the PDE status of the initial value problem. I focus on gauge choices, strong-hyperbolicity and the construction of constraint preserving boundary conditions. I show that strongly hyperbolic pure gauges can be used to build strongly hyperbolic formulations. I examine which of these formulations is additionally symmetric hyperbolic and finally demonstrate that the system can be made boundary stable.},

We then use our data together with results in the literature to calibrate simple explicit expressions for the final spin and radiated energy. Equipped with our prediction for the final state we then develop a simple and accurate merger-ringdown model based on modified Lorentzians in the gravitational-wave amplitude and phase, and we discuss a simple method to represent the low frequency signal augmenting the TaylorF2 post-Newtonian approximant with terms corresponding to higher orders in the post-Newtonian expansion.

The construction of the Schwarzschild QNM pseudospectrum reveals: i) the stability of the slowest decaying QNM under perturbations respecting the asymptotic structure, reassessing the instability of the fundamental QNM discussed by Nollert [1] as an "infrared" effect; ii) the instability of all overtones under small scale ("ultraviolet") perturbations of sufficiently high frequency, that migrate to a universal class of QNM branches along pseudospectra boundaries, shedding light on Nollert \& Price's analysis [1,2]. Methodologically, a compactified hyperboloidal approach to QNMs is adopted to cast the QNM calculation as the spectral problem of a non-selfadjoint operator. In such a setting, spectral (in)stability is naturally addressed through the notion of pseudospectrum, that we construct numerically via Chebyshev spectral methods and foster in gravity physics. After illustrating the approach with the P\textbackslash "oschl-Teller potential, we address the Schwarzschild black hole case, where QNM (in)stabilities are physically relevant in the context of black hole spectroscopy in gravitational wave physics and, conceivably, as probes into fundamental high-frequency spacetime fluctuations at the Planck scale.},

  abstract = {We present new results from two open source codes, using finite differencing and pseudo-spectral methods for the wave equations in (3+1) dimensions. We use a hyperboloidal transformation which allows direct access to null infinity and simplifies the control over characteristic speeds on Kerr-Schild backgrounds. We show that this method is ideal for attaching hyperboloidal slices or for adapting the numerical resolution in certain spacetime regions. As an example application, we study late-time Kerr tails of sub-dominant modes and obtain new insight into the splitting of decay rates. The involved conformal wave equation is freed of formally singular terms whose numerical evaluation might be problematically close to future null infinity.},

  abstract = {In this, the first of two companion papers, we present a method for finding the gravitational self-force in a modified radiation gauge for a particle moving on a geodesic in a Schwarzschild or Kerr spacetime. An extension of an earlier result by Wald is used to show the spin-weight \$\textbackslash pm 2\$ perturbed Weyl scalar (\$\textbackslash psi\_0\$ or \$\textbackslash psi\_4\$) determines the metric perturbation outside the particle up to a gauge transformation and an infinitesimal change in mass and angular momentum. A Hertz potential is used to construct the part of the retarded metric perturbation that involves no change in mass or angular momentum from \$\textbackslash psi\_0\$ in a radiation gauge. The metric perturbation is completed by adding changes in the mass and angular momentum of the background spacetime outside the radial coordinate \$r\_0\$ of the particle in any convenient gauge. The resulting metric perturbation is singular on the trajectory of the particle and discontinuous across the sphere \$r=r\_0\$. A mode-sum method can be used to renormalize the self-force, but the justification given in the published version of this paper \textbackslash cite\{sf2\} referred to work by Sam Gralla \textbackslash cite\{gralla10\} to justify the use of the renormalized self-force, and the radiation gauge we use does not satisfy the regularity conditions required by Gralla.

The model is calibrated to 19 hybrid effective-one-body\textendash numerical-relativity waveforms up to mass ratios of 1{$:$}18 and black-hole spins of |a/m|{$\sim$}0.85 (0.98 for equal-mass systems). The inspiral part of the model consists of an extension of frequency-domain post-Newtonian expressions, using higher-order terms fit to the hybrids. The merger ringdown is based on a phenomenological ansatz that has been significantly improved over previous models. The model exhibits mismatches of typically less than 1\% against all 19 calibration hybrids and an additional 29 verification hybrids, which provide strong evidence that, over the calibration region, the model is sufficiently accurate for all relevant gravitational-wave astronomy applications with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. Beyond the calibration region the model produces physically reasonable results, although we recommend caution in assuming that any merger-ringdown waveform model is accurate outside its calibration region. As an example, we note that an alternative nonprecessing model, SEOBNRv2 (calibrated up to spins of only 0.5 for unequal-mass systems), exhibits mismatch errors of up to 10\% for high spins outside its calibration region. We conclude that waveform models would benefit most from a larger number of numerical-relativity simulations of high-aligned-spin unequal-mass binaries.},

We show that if a diagonally split Runge\textendash Kutta method is unconditionally contractive in the maximum norm, then it has orders p, r which satisfy p{$\leq$}4p{$\leq$}4p \textbackslash leq 4,r{$\leq$}1r{$\leq$}1r \textbackslash leq 1.}

To first order in the angular momentum of the black hole, the scalar wave equation yields two coupled one-dimensional evolution equations. In this approximation, the late time dynamics of a massless scalar field exhibit the same power-law behavior as in the case of a Schwarzschild background. Solutions to the wave equation are also obtained for rapidly rotating black holes. In this case, owing to higher order terms in the angular momentum, the wave equation does not admit complete separation of variables and yields a two-dimensional evolution equation. The study shows that, depending on initial conditions, the late-time dynamics of a massless scalar field is dominated by the lowest-allowed mode with respect to l for a fixed value of m.},

  abstract = {For scalar, electromagnetic, or gravitational wave propagation on a background Schwarzschild blackhole, we describe the exact nonlocal radiation outer boundary conditions (robc) appropriate for a spherical outer boundary of finite radius enclosing the blackhole. Derivation of the robc is based on Laplace and spherical\textendash harmonic transformation of the Regge\textendash Wheeler equation, the pde governing the wave propagation, with the resulting radial ode an incarnation of the confluent Heun equation. For a given angular integer l the robc feature integral convolution between a time\textendash domain radiation boundary kernel (tdrk) and each of the corresponding 2l + 1 spherical\textendash harmonic modes of the radiating wave field. The tdrk is the inverse Laplace transform of a frequency\textendash domain radiation kernel (fdrk) which is essentially the logarithmic derivative of the asymptotically outgoing solution to the radial ode. We numerically implement the robc via a rapid algorithm involving approximation of the fdrk by a rational function. Such an approximation is tailored to have relative error {$\epsilon$} uniformly along the axis of imaginary Laplace frequency. Theoretically, {$\epsilon$} is also a long\textendash time bound on the relative convolution error. Via study of one\textendash dimensional radial evolutions, we demonstrate that the robc capture the phenomena of quasinormal ringing and decay tails. Moreover, carrying out a numerical experiment in which a wave packet strikes the boundary at an angle, we find that the robc yield accurate results in a three\textendash dimensional setting. Our work is a partial generalization to Schwarzschild wave propagation and Heun functions of the methods developed for flatspace wave propagation and Bessel functions by Alpert, Greengard, and Hagstrom (agh), save for one key difference. Whereas agh had the usual armamentarium of analytical results (asymptotics, order recursion relations, bispectrality) for Bessel functions at their disposal, what we need to know about Heun functions must be gathered numerically as relatively less is known about them. Therefore, unlike agh, we are unable to offer an asymptotic analysis of our rapid implementation.},

The condition on the background geometry to allow asymptotic conserved charges for a current introduced by Kastor and Traschen is found and a number of other new aspects of this current are commented on.

  abstract = {The Klein\textendash Gordon equation with nonlinear potential occurs in a wide range of application areas in science and engineering. Its computation represents a major challenge. The main theme of this paper is the construction of symmetric and arbitrarily high-order time integrators for the nonlinear Klein\textendash Gordon equation by integrating Birkhoff\textendash Hermite interpolation polynomials. To this end, under the assumption of periodic boundary conditions, we begin with the formulation of the nonlinear Klein\textendash Gordon equation as an abstract second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) and its operator-variation-of-constants formula. We then derive a symmetric and arbitrarily high-order Birkhoff\textendash Hermite time integration formula for the nonlinear abstract ODE. Accordingly, the stability, convergence and long-time behaviour are rigorously analysed once the spatial differential operator is approximated by an appropriate positive semi-definite matrix, subject to suitable temporal and spatial smoothness. A remarkable characteristic of this new approach is that the requirement of temporal smoothness is reduced compared with the traditional numerical methods for PDEs in the literature. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage and efficiency of our time integrators in comparison with the existing numerical approaches.},

  abstract = {Self-force methods can be applied in calculations of the scatter angle in two-body hyperbolic encounters, working order by order in the mass ratio (assumed small) but with no recourse to a weak-field approximation. This, in turn, can inform ongoing efforts to construct an accurate model of the general-relativistic binary dynamics via an effective-one-body description and other semi-analytical approaches. Existing self-force methods are to a large extent specialised to bound, inspiral orbits. Here we develop a technique for (numerical) self-force calculations that can efficiently tackle scatter orbits. The method is based on a time-domain reconstruction of the metric perturbation from a scalar-like Hertz potential that satisfies the Teukolsky equation, an idea pursued so far only for bound orbits. The crucial ingredient in this formulation are certain jump conditions that (each multipole mode of) the Hertz potential must satisfy along the orbit, in a 1+1-dimensional multipole reduction of the problem. We obtain a closed-form expression for these jumps, for an arbitrary geodesic orbit in Schwarzschild spacetime, and present a full numerical implementation for a scatter orbit. In this paper we focus on method development, and go only as far as calculating the Hertz potential; a calculation of the self-force and its physical effects on the scatter orbit will be the subject of forthcoming work.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the need of a robust geometrical framework for the calculation of long, and highly accurate waveforms for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, this work presents an extensive study of the hyperboloidal formalism for the Kerr spacetime and the Teukolsky equation. In a first step, we introduce a generic coordinate system foliating the Kerr spacetime into hypersurfaces of constant time extending between the black-hole horizon and future null infinity, while keeping track of the underlying degrees of freedom. Then, we express the Teukolsky equation in terms of these generic coordinates with focus on applications in both the time and frequency domains. Specifically, we derive a wave-like equation in \$2+1\$ dimensions, whose unique solution follows directly from the prescription of initial data (no external boundary conditions). Moreover, we extend the hyperboloidal formulation into the frequency domain. A comparison with the standard form of the Teukolsky equations allows us to express the regularisation factors in terms of the hyperboloidal degrees of freedom. In the second part, we discuss several hyperboloidal gauges for the Kerr solution. Of particular importance, this paper introduces the minimal gauge. The resulting expressions for the Kerr metric and underlying equations are simple enough for eventual (semi)-analytical studies. Despite the simplicity, the gauge has a very rich structure as it naturally leads to two possible limits to extremality, namely the standard extremal Kerr spacetime and its near-horizon geometry. When applied to the Teukolsky equation in the frequency domain, we show that the minimal gauge actually provides the spacetime counterpart of the well-known Leaver's formalism. Finally, we recast the hyperboloidal gauges for the Kerr spacetime available in the literature within the framework introduced here.},

Although development of black-hole gravitational-wave templates in the past decade has been revolutionary, the corresponding work for double neutron-star systems has lagged. Neutron stars can be well-modelled as simple barotropic fluids during the part of binary inspiral most relevant to gravitational wave astronomy, but the crucial geometric and mathematical consequences of this simplification have remained computationally unexploited. In particular, Carter and Lichnerowicz have described barotropic fluid motion via classical variational principles as conformally geodesic. Moreover, Kelvin's circulation theorem implies that initially irrotational flows remain irrotational. Applied to numerical relativity, these concepts lead to novel Hamiltonian or Hamilton-Jacobi schemes for evolving relativistic fluid flows. Hamiltonian methods can conserve not only flux, but also circulation and symplecticity, and moreover do not require addition of an artificial atmosphere typically required by standard conservative methods. These properties can allow production of high-precision gravitational waveforms at low computational cost. This canonical hydrodynamics approach is applicable to a wide class of problems involving theoretical or computational fluid dynamics.},

Some common remedies come with a cost in accuracy near discontinuities, or in computational cost, or in complexity of implementation. However, for certain classes of problems involving piecewise analytic functions, the jump in the function and its derivatives are known or easy to compute. We show that high-order or spectral accuracy can then be recovered by simply adding to the Lagrange interpolation formula a linear combination of the jumps. Discretizations developed for smooth problems are thus easily extended to nonsmooth problems. Furthermore, in the context of one-dimensional finite-difference or pseudospectral discretizations, numerical integration and differentiation amount to matrix multiplication. We construct the matrices for such operations, in the presence of known discontinuities, by operating on the corrected Lagrange formula. In a method-of-lines framework, this provides a simple and efficient way to obtain solutions with moving discontinuities to evolution partial differential equations.},

It is known that there exists no numerical integration method that in general preserves both the energy and the symplectic structure of a Hamiltonian system. One is thus normally forced to make a choice. Nevertheless, a symmetric integration formula, obtained by Lanczos-Dyche via two-point Taylor expansion (or Hermite interpolation), is shown here to preserve both energy as well as symplectic structure for linear systems. This formula shares similarities with the Euler-Maclaurin formula, but is superconvergent rather than asymptotically convergent. For partial differential equations, the resulting evolution methods are unconditionally stable, i.e, not subject to a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy limit. Although generally implicit, these methods become explicit for linear systems.},

The formalism is gauge invariant, and it is also covariant under two-dimensional coordinate transformations that leave the angular coordinates unchanged. The formalism is applied to the typical problem of calculating the gravitational waves produced by material sources moving in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We examine the radiation escaping to future null infinity as well as the radiation crossing the event horizon. The waveforms, the energy radiated, and the angular-momentum radiated can all be expressed in terms of two gauge-invariant scalar functions that satisfy one-dimensional wave equations. The first is the Zerilli-Moncrief function, which satisfies the Zerilli equation, and which represents the even-parity sector of the perturbation. The second is the Cunningham-Price-Moncrief function, which satisfies the Regge-Wheeler equation, and which represents the odd-parity sector of the perturbation. The covariant forms of these wave equations are presented here, complete with covariant source terms that are derived from the stress-energy tensor of the matter responsible for the perturbation. Our presentation of the formalism is concluded with a separate examination of the monopole and dipole components of the metric perturbation.},

More recent work, motivated within the context of self-force physics, extends the procedure to metric perturbations sourced by a particle in a bound geodesic orbit. However, the existing procedure leaves undetermined a certain stationary, axially-symmetric piece of the metric perturbation. In the vacuum region away from the particle, this "completion" piece corresponds simply to mass and angular-momentum perturbations of the Kerr background, with amplitudes that are, however, a priori unknown. Here we present and implement a rigorous method for finding the completion piece. The key idea is to impose continuity, off the particle, of certain gauge-invariant fields constructed from the full (completed) perturbation, in order to determine the unknown amplitude parameters of the completion piece. We implement this method in full for bound (eccentric) geodesic orbits in the equatorial plane of the Kerr black hole. Our results provide a rigorous underpinning of recent results by Friedman \{\textbackslash it et al.\}\textbackslash{} for circular orbits, and extend them to non-circular orbits.},

  abstract = {The perturbation equation in a Kerr background is written as a coupled system of one dimensional equations for the different modes in the time domain. Numerical simulations show that the dominant mode in the gravitational response is the one corresponding to the mode of the initial perturbation, allowing us to conjecture that the coupling among the modes has a weak influence in our system of equations. We conclude that by neglecting the coupling terms it can be obtained as a one dimensional harmonic equation which indeed describes with good accuracy the gravitational response from the Kerr black hole with low spin, while only a few couplings are necessary to describe a high-spin one. This result may help us to understand the structure of test fields in a Kerr background and even to generate accurate waveforms for various cases in an efficient manner.},

  abstract = {The scheduled launch of the LISA Mission in the next decade has called attention to the gravitational self-force problem. Despite an extensive body of theoretical work, long-time numerical computations of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio-inspirals remain challenging. This work proposes a class of numerical evolution schemes suitable to this problem based on Hermite integration. Their most important feature is time-reversal symmetry and unconditional stability, which enables these methods to preserve symplectic structure, energy, momentum and other Noether charges over long time periods. We apply Noether's theorem to the master fields of black hole perturbation theory on a hyperboloidal slice of Schwarzschild spacetime to show that there exist constants of evolution that numerical simulations must preserve. We demonstrate that time-symmetric integration schemes based on a 2-point Taylor expansion (such as Hermite integration) numerically conserve these quantities, unlike schemes based on a 1-point Taylor expansion (such as Runge-Kutta). This makes time-symmetric schemes ideal for long-time EMRI simulations.},

We divide this work into two broad parts: the first provides an overview of the theory of general relativity along with the basic mathematical methods underlying it, focusing on its canonical formulation and perturbation techniques; the second presents our novel work in these areas, focusing on the problems of entropy, motion and the self-force in general relativity. We begin here with a study of entropy theorems in classical Hamiltonian systems, and in particular, the issue of the second law of thermodynamics in classical mechanics and general relativity. Then, we develop a general approach based on conservation laws for calculating the correction to the motion of a sufficiently small object due to gravitational perturbations in general relativity. When the perturbations are attributed to the small object itself, this effect is known as the gravitational self-force. It is what drives the orbital evolution of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals: compact binary systems where one mass is much smaller than\textemdash thus effectively orbiting and eventually spiralling into\textemdash the other, expected to be among the main sources for the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA. Finally, we present some work on the numerical computation of the scalar self-force using an approach called the Particle-without-Particle method, as well as the generalization of this method to general partial differential equations and applications to other areas of applied mathematics.},

The first chapter collects together (but does not prove) those aspects of Lie group theory which are of importance to differential equations. Applications covered in the body of the book include calculation of symmetry groups of differential equations, integration of ordinary differential equations, including special techniques for Euler-Lagrange equations or Hamiltonian systems, differential invariants and construction of equations with pre\- scribed symmetry groups, group-invariant solutions of partial differential equations, dimensional analysis, and the connections between conservation laws and symmetry groups. Generalizations of the basic symmetry group concept, and applications to conservation laws, integrability conditions, completely integrable systems and soliton equations, and bi-Hamiltonian systems are covered in detail. The exposition is reasonably self-contained, and supplemented by numerous examples of direct physical importance, chosen from classical mechanics, fluid mechanics, elasticity and other applied areas.},

Our approach is to rewrite the Teukolsky equation as a system of first order differential equations. In this way we get a system that has the form of an advection equation. This is used in combination with a series expansion of the solution in powers of time. To obtain a fourth order scheme we kept terms up to fourth derivative in time and use the advection-like system of differential equations to substitute the temporal derivatives by spatial derivatives. A local stability study leads to a Courant factor of 1.5 for the nonrotating case. This scheme is used to evolve gravitational perturbations in Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds. Our numerical method proved to be fourth order convergent in r* and theta directions. The correct power-law tail, \textasciitilde 1/t\^\{2\textbackslash ell+3\}, for general initial data, and \textasciitilde 1/t\^\{2\textbackslash ell+4\}, for time symmetric data, was found in the simulations where the duration in time of the tail phase was long enough. We verified that it is crucial to resolve accurately the angular dependence of the mode at late times in order to obtain these values of the exponents in the power-law decay. In other cases, when the decay was too fast and round-off error was reached before a tail was developed, the quasinormal modes frequencies provided a test to determine the validity of our code.},

  abstract = {Calculations of the gravitational self-force (GSF) in curved spacetime require as input the metric perturbation in a sufficiently regular gauge. A basic challenge in the program to compute the GSF for orbits around a Kerr black hole is that the standard procedure for reconstructing the perturbation is formulated in a class of radiation gauges, in which the particle singularity is non-isotropic and extends away from the particle's location. Here we present two practical schemes for calculating the GSF using a radiation-gauge reconstructed metric as input. The schemes are based on a detailed analysis of the local structure of the particle singularity in the radiation gauges. We identify 3 types of radiation gauges: two containing a radial string-like singularity emanating from the particle, either in one direction ("half-string" gauges) or both directions ("full-string" gauges); and a third type containing no strings but with a jump discontinuity across a surface intersecting the particle. Based on a flat-space example, we argue that the standard mode-by-mode reconstruction procedure yields the "regular half" of a half-string solution, or (equivalently) either of the regular halves of a no-string solution. For the half-string case, we formulate the GSF in a locally deformed radiation gauge that removes the string singularity near the particle. We derive a mode-sum formula for the GSF in this gauge, analogous to the standard Lorenz-gauge formula but with modified regularization parameters. For the no-string case, we formulate the GSF directly, without a local deformation, and we derive a mode-sum formula that requires no correction to the parameters but involves a certain averaging procedure. We explain the consistency of our results with Gralla's invariance theorem, and discuss the correspondence between our method and a related approach by Friedman et al.},

Nevertheless, even in the case of 4D Schwarzschild spacetime\textemdash which is known to be stable\textemdash manifest positivity of the canonical energy is difficult to establish, due to the presence of constraints on the initial data as well as the gauge dependence of the canonical energy integrand. Consideration of perturbations generated by a Hertz potential would appear to be a promising way to improve this situation, since the constraints and gauge dependence are eliminated when the canonical energy is expressed in terms of the Hertz potential. We prove that the canonical energy of a metric perturbation of Schwarzschild that is generated by a Hertz potential is positive. We relate the energy quantity arising in the linear stability proof of Dafermos, Holzegel and Rodnianski (DHR) to the canonical energy of an associated metric perturbation generated by a Hertz potential. We also relate the Regge\textendash Wheeler variable of DHR to the ordinary Regge\textendash Wheeler and twist potential variables of the associated perturbation. Since the Hertz potential formalism can be generalized to a Kerr black hole, our results may be useful for the analysis of the linear stability of Kerr.},

  abstract = {When a nearly spherical star gravitationally collapses through its event horizon, it cannot leave behind a static gravitational field with nonspherical perturbations. The dynamics of these perturbations during collapse is studied with a scalar-field analog. Computations in comoving coordinates show that the field neither vanishes nor becomes singular as the star falls inside its gravitational radius. The scalar field on the surface of the star must vary as a1+a2exp(-t2M) due to time dilation. An analysis is presented of the evolution of the exterior scalar field, based on a simple wave equation containing a space-time-curvature-induced potential barrier. This barrier is shown to be impenetrable to zero-frequency waves and thus a1, the final value of the field on the surface of the star, is not manifested in the exterior; the exterior field vanishes. The detailed nature of the falloff of the field depends on backscattering off the potential. It is shown that an initially static l pole dies out as t-(2l+2). If there is no initial l pole but one develops during the collapse it must fall off as t-(2l+3). Wave equations with curvature-induced potential barriers have been derived by Regge and Wheeler and by Zerilli for gravitational perturbations. With these equations the analysis of gravitational perturbations is precisely the same as for the scalar ones. In particular, gravitational multipole perturbations (with l{$\geq$}2) fall off at large t as t-(2l+2) or t-(2l+3), depending on initial conditions. (In an accompanying paper it is shown that this result applies as well to the radiatable multipoles of a zero-rest-mass field of any integer spin.)},

Nonspherical perturbations exist in its density, pressure, electromagnetic field, and gravitational field, and in other (hypothetical) zero-rest-mass, integer-spin fields coupled to sources in the stars. Paper I analyzed the evolution of scalar-field and gravitational-field perturbations. This paper treats fields of arbitrary integer spin and zero rest mass, using the Newman-Penrose tetrad formalism. The analysis of each multipole (order=l) of each field (spin=s) is reduced to the study of a two-dimensional wave equation, with a "curvature potential" that differs little from one field to another. The analysis of this wave equation for the scalar case (s=0) carries over completely to fields of arbitrary spin s. In particular, any radiatable multipole (l{$\geq$}s) gets radiated away completely in the late stages of collapse; if the multipole is static prior to the onset of collapse, it will die out as t-(2l+2) at late times.

  abstract = {As an important and challenging problem, the study of black hole stability has attracted considerable interest over the last 60 years. With many stability results appearing over the years, it came as a surprise when Aretakis discovered a peculiar horizon instability of extremal black holes. He proved that while perturbations on an extremal black hole background themselves decay, sufficiently high-order transverse derivatives of the fields grow at late times precisely on the horizon. In this thesis, we have advanced our understanding of this instability. General proofs of the instability rely on the extremal horizon having compact topology. We find the first example of a system having a planar (non-compact) horizon topology that exhibits this instability---the planar Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in five spacetime dimensions that is asymptotically Anti-de-Sitter (AdS). Asymptotically AdS black holes are particularly interesting in light of the AdS/CFT correspondence (holography) where these systems can be mapped to strongly coupled field theories that 'live' on the boundary of these spacetimes. We find that the horizon instability is crucial in preserving temporal conformal symmetry of correlators in the corresponding strongly coupled field theory. To obtain a glimpse of a unifying picture of the horizon instability of extremal black holes, we investigate the instability in the simplest possible setting---the BTZ black hole. We show that the instability is associated with a class of null geodesics that orbit near the event horizon arbitrarily many times before falling in. This provides a physical interpretation of perturbations being trapped near the event horizon for arbitrarily long periods, causing the horizon to be unstable. Prior work has associated the appearance of the horizon instability to an AdS2-factored near horizon geometry, a feature common to all extremal black holes. However, extremal black branes that arise in string theory have different near-horizon geometries. We study the extremal D3 brane, which has an AdS5-factored near horizon geometry. We find evidence that such an instability does not arise in this geometry, which bolsters the idea that an AdS2-factored near horizon geometry is crucial for the horizon instability to occur.},

  abstract = {The characteristic damping times of the natural oscillations of a Kerr black hole become arbitrarily large as the extremal limit is approached. This behavior is associated with the so-called zero damped modes (ZDMs), and suggests that extremal black holes are characterized by quasinormal modes whose frequencies are purely real. Since these frequencies correspond to oscillations whose angular phase velocity matches the horizon angular velocity of the black hole, they are sometimes called "synchronous frequencies". Several authors have studied the ZDMs for near-extremal black holes. Recently, their correspondence to branch points of the Green's function of the wave equation was linked to the Aretakis instability of extremal black holes. Here we investigate the existence of ZDMs for extremal black holes, showing that these real-axis resonances of the field are unphysical as natural black hole oscillations: the corresponding frequency is always associated with a scattering mode. By analyzing the behavior of these modes near the event horizon we obtain new insight into the transition to extremality, including a simple way to understand the Aretakis instability.},

We excise the singular interior of the black hole and assume a marginally outer trapped surface as inner boundary of the computational domain. The momentum and Hamiltonian constraints are solved by means of pseudo-spectral methods and we find exponential rates of convergence of our numerical solutions.

  abstract = {In quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, a Schr\"odinger field, named after Erwin Schr\"odinger, is a quantum field which obeys the Schr\"odinger equation. While any situation described by a Schr\"odinger field can also be described by a many-body Schr\"odinger equation for identical particles, the field theory is more suitable for situations where the particle number changes. A Schr\"odinger field is also the classical limit of a quantum Schr\"odinger field, a classical wave which satisfies the Schr\"odinger equation. Unlike the quantum mechanical wavefunction, if there are interactions between the particles the equation will be nonlinear. These nonlinear equations describe the classical wave limit of a system of interacting identical particles. The path integral of a Schr\"odinger field is also known as a coherent state path integral, because the field itself is an annihilation operator whose eigenstates can be thought of as coherent states of the harmonic oscillations of the field modes. Schr\"odinger fields are useful for describing Bose\textendash Einstein condensation, the Bogolyubov\textendash de Gennes equation of superconductivity, superfluidity, and many-body theory in general. They are also a useful alternative formalism for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. A Schr\"odinger field is the nonrelativistic limit of a Klein\textendash Gordon field.},

  abstract = {This is the second of two companion papers on computing the self-force in a radiation gauge; more precisely, the method uses a radiation gauge for the radiative part of the metric perturbation, together with an arbitrarily chosen gauge for the parts of the perturbation associated with changes in black-hole mass and spin and with a shift in the center of mass. We compute the conservative part of the self-force for a particle in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. The gauge vector relating our radiation gauge to a Lorenz gauge is helically symmetric, implying that the quantity h\_\{\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash beta\} u\^\textbackslash alpha u\^\textbackslash beta (= h\_\{uu\}) must have the same value for our radiation gauge as for a Lorenz gauge; and we confirm this numerically to one part in 10\^\{13\}. As outlined in the first paper, the perturbed metric is constructed from a Hertz potential that is in term obtained algebraically from the the retarded perturbed spin-2 Weyl scalar, \textbackslash psi\_0 . We use a mode-sum renormalization and find the renormalization coefficients by matching a series in L = \textbackslash ell + 1/2 to the large-L behavior of the expression for the self-force in terms of the retarded field h\_\{\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash beta\}\^\{ret\}; we similarly find the leading renormalization coefficients of h\_\{uu\} and the related change in the angular velocity of the particle due to its self-force. We show numerically that the singular part of the self-force has the form f\_\{\textbackslash alpha\} \textbackslash propto {$<$} \textbackslash nabla\_\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash rho\^\{-1\}{$>$}, the part of \textbackslash nabla\_\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash rho\^\{-1\} that is axisymmetric about a radial line through the particle. This differs only by a constant from its form for a Lorenz gauge. It is because we do not use a radiation gauge to describe the change in black-hole mass that the singular part of the self-force has no singularity along a radial line through the particle and, at least in this example, is spherically symmetric to subleading order in \textbackslash rho.},

  abstract = {We present a novel analytic extraction of high-order post-Newtonian (pN) parameters that govern quasi-circular binary systems. Coefficients in the pN expansion of the energy of a binary system can be found from corresponding coefficients in an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) computation of the change \$\textbackslash Delta U\$ in the redshift factor of a circular orbit at fixed angular velocity. Remarkably, by computing this essentially gauge-invariant quantity to accuracy greater than one part in \$10\^\{225\}\$, and by assuming that a subset of pN coefficients are rational numbers or products of \$\textbackslash pi\$ and a rational, we obtain the exact analytic coefficients. We find the previously unexpected result that the post-Newtonian expansion of \$\textbackslash Delta U\$ (and of the change \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash Omega\$ in the angular velocity at fixed redshift factor) have conservative terms at half-integral pN order beginning with a 5.5 pN term. This implies the existence of a corresponding 5.5 pN term in the expansion of the energy of a binary system. Coefficients in the pN series that do not belong to the subset just described are obtained to accuracy better than 1 part in \$10\^\{265-23n\}\$ at \$n\$th pN order. We work in a radiation gauge, finding the radiative part of the metric perturbation from the gauge-invariant Weyl scalar \$\textbackslash psi\_0\$ via a Hertz potential. We use mode-sum renormalization, and find high-order renormalization coefficients by matching a series in \$L=\textbackslash ell+1/2\$ to the large-\$L\$ behavior of the expression for \$\textbackslash Delta U\$. The non-radiative parts of the perturbed metric associated with changes in mass and angular momentum are calculated in the Schwarzschild gauge.},

  abstract = {In special functions, a topic in mathematics, spin-weighted spherical harmonics are generalizations of the standard spherical harmonics and\textemdash like the usual spherical harmonics\textemdash are functions on the sphere.  Unlike ordinary spherical harmonics, the spin-weighted harmonics are U(1) gauge fields rather than scalar fields: mathematically, they take values in a complex line bundle.  The spin-weighted harmonics are organized by degree l, just like ordinary spherical harmonics, but have an additional spin weight s that reflects the additional U(1) symmetry.  A special basis of harmonics can be derived from the Laplace spherical harmonics Ylm, and are typically denoted by sYlm, where l and m are the usual parameters familiar from the standard Laplace spherical harmonics.  In this special basis, the spin-weighted spherical harmonics appear as actual functions, because the choice of a polar axis fixes the U(1) gauge ambiguity.  The spin-weighted spherical harmonics can be obtained from the standard spherical harmonics by application of spin raising and lowering operators.  In particular, the spin-weighted spherical harmonics of spin weight s = 0 are simply the standard spherical harmonics:                                                                      0                                        Y                        l             m                             =                    Y                        l             m                                       .                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \{\}\_\{0\}Y\_\{lm\}=Y\_\{lm\}\textbackslash{} .\}   Spaces of spin-weighted spherical harmonics were first identified in connection with the representation theory of the Lorentz group (Gelfand, Minlos \& Shapiro 1958).  They were subsequently and independently rediscovered by Newman \& Penrose (1966) and applied to describe gravitational radiation, and again by Wu \& Yang (1976) as so-called "monopole harmonics" in the study of Dirac monopoles.},

  abstract = {Conserved currents associated with the time translation and axial symmetries of the Kerr spacetime and with scaling symmetry are constructed for the Teukolsky Master Equation (TME). Three partly different approaches are taken, of which the third one applies only to the spacetime symmetries. The results yielded by the three approaches, which correspond to three variants of Noether's theorem, are essentially the same, nevertheless. The construction includes the embedding of the TME into a larger system of equations, which admits a Lagrangian and turns out to consist of two TMEs with opposite spin weight. The currents thus involve two independent solutions of the TME with opposite spin weights. The first approach provides an example of the application of an extension of Noether's theorem to nonvariational differential equations. This extension is also reviewed in general form. The variant of Noether's theorem applied in the third approach is a generalization of the standard construction of conserved currents associated with spacetime symmetries in general relativity, in which the currents are obtained by the contraction of the symmetric energy-momentum tensor with the relevant Killing vector fields. Symmetries and conserved currents related to boundary conditions are introduced as well, and Noether's theorem and its variant for nonvariational differential equations are extended to them. The extension of the latter variant is used to construct conserved currents related to the Sommerfeld boundary condition.},

One approach to the numerical quadrature of such integrals is to apply the trapezoid rule on a Hankel contour defined by a suitable change of variables. Optimal parameters for three classes of such contours have recently been derived: (a) parabolas, (b) hyperbolas, and (c) cotangent contours, following Talbot in 1979. The convergence rates for these optimized quadrature formulas are very fast: roughly O(3-N), where N is the number of sample points or function evaluations. On the other hand, convergence at a rate apparently about twice as fast, O(9.28903-N), can be achieved by using a different approach: best supremum-norm rational approximants to ezfor z{$\in$}(\textendash{$\infty$},0], following Cody, Meinardus and Varga in 1969. (All these rates are doubled in the case of self-adjoint operators or real integrands.) It is shown that the quadrature formulas can be interpreted as rational approximations and the rational approximations as quadrature formulas, and the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches are discussed in the light of these connections. A MATLAB function is provided for computing Cody\textendash Meinardus\textendash Varga approximants by the method of Carath\'eodory\textendash Fej\'er approximation.},

  abstract = {Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) will be key sources for LISA. However, accurately extracting system parameters from a detected EMRI waveform will require self-force calculations at second order in perturbation theory, which are still in a nascent stage. One major obstacle in these calculations is the strong divergences that are encountered on the worldline of the small object. Previously, it was shown by one of us [Phys. Rev. D 95, 104056 (2017)] that a class of "highly regular" gauges exist in which the singularities have a qualitatively milder form, promising to enable more efficient numerical calculations. Here we derive expressions for the metric perturbation in this class of gauges, in a local expansion in powers of distance \$r\$ from the worldline, to sufficient order in \$r\$ for numerical implementation in a puncture scheme. Additionally, we use the highly regular class to rigorously derive a distributional source for the second-order field and a pointlike second-order stress-energy tensor (the Detweiler stress-energy) for the small object. This makes it possible to calculate the second-order self-force using mode-sum regularisation rather than the more cumbersome puncture schemes that have been necessary previously. Although motivated by EMRIs, our calculations are valid in an arbitrary vacuum background, and they may help clarify the interpretation of point masses and skeleton sources in general relativity more broadly.},

However, such an approach cannot be employed to define `conserved quantities' in a situation where symplectic current can be radiated away (such as occurs at null infinity in general relativity) because there does not, in general, exist a Hamiltonian which generates the given asymptotic symmetry. (This fact is closely related to the fact that the desired `conserved quantities' are not, in general, conserved!) In this paper we give a prescription for defining `conserved quantities' by proposing a modification of the equation that must be satisfied by a Hamiltonian. Our prescription is a very general one, and is applicable to a very general class of asymptotic conditions in arbitrary diffeomorphism covariant theories of gravity derivable from a Lagrangian, although we have not investigated existence and uniqueness issues in the most general contexts. In the case of general relativity with the standard asymptotic conditions at null infinity, our prescription agrees with the one proposed by Dray and Streubel from entirely different considerations.},

  abstract = {We review the mathematically rigorous formulation of the quantum theory of a linear field propagating in a globally hyperbolic spacetime. This formulation is accomplished via the algebraic approach, which, in essence, simultaneously admits all states in all possible (unitarily inequivalent) Hilbert space constructions. The physically nonsingular states are restricted by the requirement that their two-point function satisfy the Hadamard condition, which insures that the ultra-violet behavior of the state be similar to that of the vacuum state in Minkowski spacetime, and that the expected stress-energy tensor in the state be finite. We briefly review the Unruh and Hawking effects from the perspective of the theoretical framework adopted here. A brief discussion also is given of several open issues and questions in quantum field theory in curved spacetime regarding the treatment of ``backreaction'', the validity of some version of the ``averaged null energy condition'', and the formulation and properties of quantum field theory in causality violating spacetimes.},

We first discuss in greater detail the two distinct types of quasinormal mode frequencies presented in a recent paper (arXiv:1212.3271). One set of modes, that we call "zero-damping modes", has vanishing imaginary part in the extremal limit, and exists for all corotating perturbations (i.e., modes with azimuthal index m being nonnegative). The other set (the "damped modes") retains a finite decay rate even for extremal Kerr black holes, and exists only for a subset of corotating modes. As the angular momentum approaches its extremal value, the frequency spectrum bifurcates into these two distinct branches when both types of modes are present. We discuss the physical reason for the mode branching by developing and using a bound-state formulation for the perturbations of generic Kerr black holes. We also numerically explore the specific case of the fundamental l=2 modes, which have the greatest astrophysical interest. Using the results of these investigations, we compute the quasinormal mode response of a nearly extremal Kerr black hole to perturbations. We show that many superimposed overtones result in a slow power-law decay of the quasinormal ringing at early times, which later gives way to exponential decay.

  abstract = {There is a well-known, intuitive geometric correspondence between high-frequency QNMs of Schwarzschild black holes and null geodesics that reside on the light-ring : the real part of the mode's frequency relates to the geodesic's orbital frequency, and the imaginary part of the frequency corresponds to the Lyapunov exponent of the orbit. For slowly rotating black holes, the QNM real frequency is a linear combination of a the orbit's precessional and orbital frequencies, but the correspondence is otherwise unchanged. In this paper, we find a relationship between the QNM frequencies of Kerr black holes of arbitrary (astrophysical) spins and general spherical photon orbits, which is analogous to the relationship for slowly rotating holes. To derive this result, we first use the WKB approximation to compute accurate algebraic expressions for large-l QNM frequencies. Comparing our WKB calculation to the leading-order, geometric-optics approximation to scalar-wave propagation in the Kerr spacetime, we then draw a correspondence between the real parts of the parameters of a QNM and the conserved quantities of spherical photon orbits. At next-to-leading order in this comparison, we relate the imaginary parts of the QNM parameters to coefficients that modify the amplitude of the scalar wave. With this correspondence, we find a geometric interpretation to two features of the QNM spectrum of Kerr black holes: First, for Kerr holes rotating near the maximal rate, a large number of modes have nearly zero damping; we connect this characteristic to the fact that a large number of spherical photon orbits approach the horizon in this limit. Second, for black holes of any spins, the frequencies of specific sets of modes are degenerate; we find that this feature arises when the spherical photon orbits corresponding to these modes form closed (as opposed to ergodically winding) curves.},

  abstract = {The numerical investigation of wave propagation in the asymptotic domain of Kerr spacetime has only recently been possible thanks to the construction of suitable hyperboloidal coordinates. The asymptotics revealed an apparent puzzle in the decay rates of scalar fields: the late-time rates seemed to depend on whether finite distance observers are in the strong field domain or far away from the rotating black hole, an apparent phenomenon dubbed "splitting". We discuss far-field "splitting" in the full field and near-horizon "splitting" in certain projected modes using horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates. For either case we propose an explanation to the cause of the "splitting" behavior, and we determine uniquely decay rates that previous studies found to be ambiguous or immeasurable. The far-field "splitting" is explained by competition between projected modes. The near-horizon "splitting" is due to excitation of lower multipole modes that back excite the multipole mode for which "splitting" is observed. In both cases "splitting" is an intermediate effect, such that asymptotically in time strong field rates are valid at all finite distances. At any finite time, however, there are three domains with different decay rates whose boundaries move outwards during evolution. We then propose a formula for the decay rate of tails that takes into account the inter--mode excitation effect that we study.},

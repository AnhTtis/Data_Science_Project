    "abstract": "Phylogenetic and discrete-trait evolutionary inference depend heavily on appropriate characterization of the underlying substitution process. In this paper, we present random-effects substitution models that extend common continuous-time Markov chain models into a richer class of processes capable of capturing a wider variety of substitution dynamics. As these random-effects substitution models often require many more parameters than their usual counterparts, inference can be both statistically and computationally challenging. Thus, we also propose an efficient approach to compute an approximation to the gradient of the data likelihood with respect to all unknown substitution model parameters. We demonstrate that this approximate gradient enables scaling of both sampling-based (Bayesian inference via HMC) and maximization-based inference (MAP estimation) under random-effects substitution models across large trees and state-spaces. Applied to a dataset of 583 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, an HKY model with random-effects shows strong signals of nonreversibility in the substitution process, and posterior predictive model checks clearly show that it is more adequate than a reversible model. When analyzing the pattern of phylogeographic spread of 1441 influenza A virus (H3N2) sequences between 14 regions, a random-effects phylogeographic substitution model infers that air travel volume adequately predicts almost all dispersal rates. A random-effects state-dependent substitution model reveals no evidence for an effect of arboreality on the swimming mode in the tree frog subfamily Hylinae. On a dataset of 28 taxa spanning the Metazoa, a random-effects amino acid substitution model finds evidence of notable departures from the current best-fit amino acid model in seconds. We show that our gradient-based inference approach is over an order of magnitude more time efficient than conventional approaches.",

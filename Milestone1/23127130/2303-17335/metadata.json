    "abstract": "Given a subshift of finite type and a finite set $\\mathcal{W}$ of admissible words, we consider two types of points in the shift space. One are the admissible sequences in which the words in $\\mathcal{W}$ appear frequently, and the other are those in which arbitrarily long consecutive repetitions of words in $\\mathcal{W}$ cannot appear. We investigate the $u$-dimension of the set of such types of points at which the Birkhoff sums of some given function are bounded. The results have a natural implication on the upper and lower \\holder derivatives of the cumulative distribution function of a Gibbs measure on an interval.",

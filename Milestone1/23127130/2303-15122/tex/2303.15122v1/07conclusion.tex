\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This work presents \OURNAME, an implicit neural representation-based face parsing network. We exploit the human face's regular and locally consistent structure to propose a low-parameter, local implicit image function-based network that can predict per-pixel labels for a human face image. Our model is $1/26^{th}$ or lesser in size compared to the current SOTA models of face parsing but outperforms them on mean-F1 and mean-IoU over multiple datasets like CelebAMask-HQ and LaPa. This network can also generate outputs at multiple resolutions, which can be very useful in reducing the inference time of segmentation by generating output at a lower resolution. These properties make it feasible to use this architecture on low-resource devices. 

Future work will address misprediction in regions with fewer class labels. We would also extend Implicit neural representation-based segmentation to domains with a regular and consistent structure, like medical imaging, human body parts, etc., and to domains where structure uniformity is not guaranteed, like in the wild images.

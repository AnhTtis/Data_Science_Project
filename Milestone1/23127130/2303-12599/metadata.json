    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a local-refinement procedure to investigate stability data on an abelian category, and provide a sufficient and necessary condition for a stability data to be finest. We classify all the finest stability data for the categories of coherent sheaves over certain weighted projective curves, including the classical projective line, smooth elliptic curves and certain weighted projective lines. As applications, we obtain a classification of torsion pairs for these categories via stability data approach. As a by-product, a new proof for the classification of torsion pairs in any tube category is also provided.",

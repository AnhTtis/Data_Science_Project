    "abstract": "Here, we describe synthesis of TMD crystals using a two-step flux growth method that eliminates a major potential source of contamination. Detailed characterization of TMDs grown by this two-step method reveals charged and isovalent defects with densities an order of magnitude lower than in TMDs grown by a single-step flux technique. Initial temperature-dependent electrical transport measurements of monolayer WSe2 yield room-temperature hole mobility above 840 cm2/Vs and low-temperature disorder-limited mobility above 44,000 cm2/Vs. Electrical transport measurements of graphene-WSe2 heterostructures fabricated from the two-step flux grown WSe2 also show superior performance: higher graphene mobility, lower charged impurity density, and well-resolved integer quantum Hall states.",

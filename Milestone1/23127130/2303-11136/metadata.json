    "abstract": "We provide relationships between the spectral convergences in Bérard-Besson-Gallot sense, in Kasue-Kumura sense and the measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, for compact finite dimensional RCD spaces. As an independent interest, a canonical approximation map between such spaces with respect to spectral datas is obtained.",

                  array in order to acquire an array of spectrally multiplexed modulated sub-images. Then the original
                  HS image is reconstructed using a compressive sensing reconstruction algorithm. The HS camera has high
                  optical throughput and enables acquisition of almost gigapixel HS datacubes with hundreds of spectral
                  bands. Using our camera, we demonstrate optical compression of approximately 37:1.},

  abstract  = {The acquisition of hyperspectral (HS) image datacubes with available 2D sensor arrays involves a time
                  consuming scanning process. In the last decade, several compressive sensing (CS) techniques were
                  proposed to reduce the HS acquisition time. In this paper, we present a method for near-infrared (NIR)
                  HS imaging which relies on our rapid CS resonator spectroscopy technique. Within the framework of CS,
                  and by using a modified Fabry-Perot resonator, a sequence of spectrally modulated images is used to
                  recover NIR HS datacubes. Owing to the innovative CS design, we demonstrate the ability to reconstruct
                  NIR HS images with hundreds of spectral bands from an order of magnitude fewer measurements, i.e. with
                  a compression ratio of about 10:1. This high compression ratio, together with the high optical
                  throughput of the system, facilitates fast acquisition of large HS datacubes.},

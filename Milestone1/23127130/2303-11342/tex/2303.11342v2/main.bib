   abstract = {There have been many techniques developed in recent years to in silico model a variety of cancer behaviors. Agent-based modeling is a specific discrete-based hybrid modeling approach that allows simulating the role of diversity in cell populations as well as within each individual cell; it has therefore become a powerful modeling method widely used by computational cancer researchers. Many aspects of tumor morphology including phenotype-changing mutations, the adaptation to microenvironment, the process of angiogenesis, the influence of extracellular matrix, reactions to chemotherapy or surgical intervention, the effects of oxygen and nutrient availability, and metastasis and invasion of healthy tissues have been incorporated and investigated in agent-based models. In this review, we introduce some of the most recent agent-based models that have provided insight into the understanding of cancer growth and invasion, spanning multiple biological scales in time and space, and we further describe several experimentally testable hypotheses generated by those models. We also discuss some of the current challenges of multiscale agent-based cancer models.},

   abstract = {Cancer biology involves complex, dynamic interactions between cancer cells and their tissue microenvironments. Single-cell effects are critical drivers of clinical progression. Chemical and mechanical communication between tumor and stromal cells can co-opt normal physiologic processes to promote growth and invasion. Cancer cell heterogeneity increases cancer’s ability to test strategies to adapt to microenvironmental stresses. Hypoxia and treatment can select for cancer stem cells and drive invasion and resistance. Cell-based computational models (also known as discrete models, agent-based models, or individual-based models) simulate individual cells as they interact in virtual tissues, which allows us to explore how single-cell behaviors lead to the dynamics we observe and work to control in cancer systems. In this review, we introduce the broad range of techniques available for cell-based computational modeling. The approaches can range from highly detailed models of just a few cells and their morphologies to millions of simpler cells in three-dimensional tissues. Modeling individual cells allows us to directly translate biologic observations into simulation rules. In many cases, individual cell agents include molecular-scale models. Most models also simulate the transport of oxygen, drugs, and growth factors, which allow us to link cancer development to microenvironmental conditions. We illustrate these methods with examples drawn from cancer hypoxia, angiogenesis, invasion, stem cells, and immunosurveillance. An ecosystem of interoperable cell-based simulation tools is emerging at a time when cloud computing resources make software easier to access and supercomputing resources make large-scale simulation studies possible. As the field develops, we anticipate that high-throughput simulation studies will allow us to rapidly explore the space of biologic possibilities, prescreen new therapeutic strategies, and even re-engineer tumor and stromal cells to bring cancer systems under control.},

   abstract = {<p>The hypoxic conditions within avascular solid tumours may trigger the secretion of chemical factors, which diffuse to the nearby vasculature and promote the formation of new vessels eventually joining the tumour. Mathematical models of this process, known as tumour angiogenesis, have mainly investigated the formation of the new capillary networks using reaction-diffusion equations. Since angiogenesis involves the growth dynamics of the endothelial cells sprouting, we propose in this work an alternative mechanistic approach, developing a surface growth model for studying capillary formation and network dynamics. The model takes into account the proliferation of endothelial cells on the pre-existing capillary surface, coupled with the bulk diffusion of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The thermo-dynamical consistency is imposed by means of interfacial and bulk balance laws. Finite element simulations show that both the morphology and the dynamics of the sprouting vessels are controlled by the bulk diffusion of VEGF and the chemo-mechanical and geometric properties at the capillary interface. Similarly to dendritic growth processes, we suggest that the emergence of tree-like vessel structures during tumour angiogenesis may result from the free boundary instability driven by competition between chemical and mechanical phenomena occurring at different length-scales.</p>},

   abstract = {We propose a cellular automaton model of solid tumour growth, in which each cell is equipped with a micro-environment response network. This network is modelled using a feed-forward artificial neural network, that takes environmental variables as an input and from these determines the cellular behaviour as the output. The response of the network is determined by connection weights and thresholds in the network, which are subject to mutations when the cells divide. As both available space and nutrients are limited resources for the tumour, this gives rise to clonal evolution where only the fittest cells survive. Using this approach we have investigated the impact of the tissue oxygen concentration on the growth and evolutionary dynamics of the tumour. The results show that the oxygen concentration affects the selection pressure, cell population diversity and morphology of the tumour. A low oxygen concentration in the tissue gives rise to a tumour with a fingered morphology that contains aggressive phenotypes with a small apoptotic potential, while a high oxygen concentration in the tissue gives rise to a tumour with a round morphology containing less evolved phenotypes. The tissue oxygen concentration thus affects the tumour at both the morphological level and on the phenotype level. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This work demonstrates that such residual solid stresses can provoke a buckling instability in heterogeneous tumor spheroids. The growth rate ratio between the outer shell of proliferative cells and the inner necrotic core is the control parameter of this instability. The buckled morphology is found to depend both on the elastic and the geometric properties of the tumor components, suggesting a key role of residual stresses for promoting tumor invasiveness.

   abstract = {Inherited lung cancer risk, particularly in nonsmokers, is poorly understood. Genomic and ancestry analysis of 1,153 lung cancers from Latin America revealed striking associations between Native American ancestry and their somatic landscape, including tumor mutational burden, and specific driver mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and STK11. A local Native American ancestry risk score was more strongly correlated with EGFR mutation frequency compared with global ancestry correlation, suggesting that germline genetics (rather than environmental exposure) underlie these disparities. SIGNIFICANCE: The frequency of somatic EGFR and KRAS mutations in lung cancer varies by ethnicity, but we do not understand why. Our study suggests that the variation in EGFR and KRAS mutation frequency is associated with genetic ancestry and suggests further studies to identify germline alleles that underpin this association.See related commentary by Gomez et al., p. 534.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 521.},

   abstract = {Curvature is a central morphological feature of tissues, cells, and sub-cellular structures. A challenge for computational biology is to measure the curvature of these structures from biological image data. We present an open-source Fiji plugin for measuring curvature using B-splines. The plugin is named Kappa after the Greek symbol for curvature, κ. Kappa is semi-automated: users create an initialization curve by a point-click method, and the initialization curve is fit to the underlying data using an iterative minimization algorithm. We demonstrate Kappa's applicability on images of cytoskeletal filaments in vitro, the cell wall of budding yeast, and whole worms moving in an agar dish. In order to verify the accuracy and precision of Kappa, we created a bank of synthetic images of known curvature using sine waves and golden spirals, which we digitized with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), pixel sizes, and point-spread functions (PSF). For synthetic images with characteristics similar to real data, the measured curvatures of those images show a high correlation with the theoretical curvatures. Our fitting algorithms perform better with higher SNR, smaller pixel sizes, and especially PSFs equivalent to super-resolution microscopy data (surprise, surprise). Kappa is freely available under the MIT license for simple integration into Fiji-based workflows. The source code and documentation can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/brouhardlab/Kappa.

   abstract = {The circulatory system is one of the first to function during development. The earliest event in the system's development is vasculogenesis, whereby vascular progeniter cells form clusters called blood islands, which later fuse to form capillary networks. There exists a very good in vitro system that mimics this process. When HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) are cultured on Matrigel, they spontaneously form a capillary network structure. Two theoretical models have been proposed to explain the pattern formation of this in vitro system. Both models utilize chemotaxis to generate spatial instability, and one model specifies VEGF as the chemoattractant. However, there are several unknown factors concerning the experimental model. First, the pattern formation process occurs at the interface between the liquid medium and Matrigel, and it is unclear whether diffusion in the liquid or gel is critical. Second, the diffusion coefficient of VEGF, which determines the spatial scale of the capillary structure, has not been properly measured. In the present study, we modified the experimental system to clarify the effect of diffusion in Matrigel, and experimentally measured the diffusion coefficient of VEGF in this system. The relationship with the spatial scale of the pattern generated is discussed. Â© EDP Sciences, 2009.},

This is most apparent in the early stages of tumor development, whereby different routes of tumor development are taken when either Clara cells or alveolar type 2 cells serve as the initiating cell type. Both the physical site of onset and the marker expression of the early lesions are distinct.

Here we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with inÂ vivo lineage tracing and organoid models to finely map the trajectories of alveolar-lineage cells during injury repair and lung regeneration. We identified a distinct AT2-lineage population, damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs), that arises during alveolar regeneration. We found that interstitial macrophage-derived IL-1Î² primes a subset of AT2 cells expressing Il1r1 for conversion into DATPs via a HIF1Î±-mediated glycolysis pathway, which is required for mature AT1 cell differentiation. Importantly, chronic inflammation mediated by IL-1Î² prevents AT1 differentiation, leading to aberrant accumulation of DATPs and impaired alveolar regeneration. Together, this stepwise mapping to cell fate transitions shows how an inflammatory niche controls alveolar regeneration by controlling stem cell fate and behavior.},

   abstract = {Mutant KRAS is a common driver in epithelial cancers. Nevertheless, molecular changes occurring early after activation of oncogenic KRAS in epithelial cells remain poorly understood. We compared transcriptional changes at single-cell resolution after KRAS activation in four sample sets. In addition to patient samples and genetically engineered mouse models, we developed organoid systems from primary mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived lung epithelial cells to model early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. In all four settings, alveolar epithelial progenitor (AT2) cells expressing oncogenic KRAS had reduced expression of mature lineage identity genes. These findings demonstrate the utility of our inÂ vitro organoid approaches for uncovering the early consequences of oncogenic KRAS expression. This resource provides an extensive collection of datasets and describes organoid tools to study the transcriptional and proteomic changes that distinguish normal epithelial progenitor cells from early-stage lung cancer, facilitating the search for targets for KRAS-driven tumors.},

   abstract = {<p> Interferons (IFNs) are central to antiviral immunity. Viral recognition elicits IFN production, which in turn triggers the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which engage in various antiviral functions. Type I IFNs (IFN-Î± and IFN-Î²) are widely expressed and can result in immunopathology during viral infections. By contrast, type III IFN (IFN-Î») responses are primarily restricted to mucosal surfaces and are thought to confer antiviral protection without driving damaging proinflammatory responses. Accordingly, IFN-Î» has been proposed as a therapeutic in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other such viral respiratory diseases (see the Perspective by Grajales-Reyes and Colonna). Broggi <italic>et al.</italic> report that COVID-19 patient morbidity correlates with the high expression of type I and III IFNs in the lung. Furthermore, IFN-Î» secreted by dendritic cells in the lungs of mice exposed to synthetic viral RNA causes damage to the lung epithelium, which increases susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections. Similarly, using a mouse model of influenza infection, Major <italic>et al.</italic> found that IFN signaling (especially IFN-Î») hampers lung repair by inducing p53 and inhibiting epithelial proliferation and differentiation. Complicating this picture, Hadjadj <italic>et al.</italic> observed that peripheral blood immune cells from severe and critical COVID-19 patients have diminished type I IFN and enhanced proinflammatory interleukin-6â€“ and tumor necrosis factor-Î±â€“fueled responses. This suggests that in contrast to local production, systemic production of IFNs may be beneficial. The results of this trio of studies suggest that the location, timing, and duration of IFN exposure are critical parameters underlying the success or failure of therapeutics for viral respiratory infections. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cancer in the world. Activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations are a positive predictive factor for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). For common EGFR mutations (Del19, L858R), the standard first-line treatment is actually third-generation TKI, osimertinib. In the case of first-line treatment by first (erlotinib, gefitinib)- or second-generation (afatinib) TKIs, osimertinib is approved in second-line treatment for patients with T790M EGFR mutation. Despite the excellent disease control results with EGFR TKIs, acquired resistance inevitably occurs and remains a biological challenge. This leads to the discovery of novel biomarkers and possible drug targets, which vary among the generation/line of EGFR TKIs. Besides EGFR second/third mutations, alternative mechanisms could be involved, such as gene amplification or gene fusion, which could be detected by different molecular techniques on different types of biological samples. Histological transformation is another mechanism of resistance with some biological predictive factors that needs tumor biopsy. The place of liquid biopsy also depends on the generation/line of EGFR TKIs and should be a good candidate for molecular monitoring. This article is based on the literature and proposes actual and future directions in clinical and translational research.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Physiological and pathological processes including embryogenesis and tumorigenesis rely on the ability of individual cells to work collectively to form multicell patterns. In these heterogeneous multicell systems, cell-cell signaling induces differential adhesion between cells that leads to tissue-level patterning. However, the sensitivity of pattern formation to changes in the strengths of signaling or cell adhesion processes is not well understood. Prior work has explored these issues using synthetically engineered heterogeneous multicell spheroid systems, in which cell subpopulations engage in bidirectional intercellular signaling to regulate the expression of different cadherins. While engineered cell systems provide excellent experimental tools to observe pattern formation in cell populations, computational models of these systems may be leveraged to explore more systematically how specific combinations of signaling and adhesion parameters can drive the emergence of unique patterns. We developed and validated two- and three-dimensional agent-based models (ABMs) of spheroid patterning for previously described cells engineered with a bidirectional signaling circuit that regulates N- and P-cadherin expression. Systematic exploration of model predictions, some of which were experimentally validated, revealed how cell seeding parameters, the order of signaling events, probabilities of induced cadherin expression, and homotypic adhesion strengths affect pattern formation. Unsupervised clustering was also used to map combinations of signaling and adhesion parameters to these unique spheroid patterns predicted by the ABM. Finally, we demonstrated how the model may be deployed to design new synthetic cell signaling circuits based on a desired final multicell pattern.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common clinical problem in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients; however, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Recent studies indicate that the frequency of the L858R mutant form of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-L858R) is higher in lung adenocarcinoma with MPE than in surgically resected specimens, suggesting that lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring this mutation tend to invade the adjacent pleural cavity. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between the EGFR-L858R mutation and cancer cell invasion ability and to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of MPE. We found that expression of EGFR-L858R in lung cancer cells resulted in up-regulation of the CXCR4 in association with increased cancer cell invasive ability and MPE formation. Ectopic expression of EGFR-L858R in lung cancer cells acted through activation of ERK signaling pathways to induce the expression of CXCR4. We also indicated that Inhibition of CXCR4 with small interfering RNA, neutralizing antibody, or receptor antagonist significantly suppressed the EGFR-L858R–dependent cell invasion. These results suggest that targeting the production of CXCR4 and blocking the CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway might be effective strategies for treating NSCLCs harboring a specific type of EGFR mutation.</p>},

The population frequencies of these three blood disorders fit well with a hierarchical model of hematopoiesis. The fate of any mutant clone will depend on the target cell and on the fitness advantage, if any, that the mutation confers on the cell. In general, we can expect that only a mutation in a hematopoietic stem cell will give long-term disease; the same mutation taking place in a cell located more downstream may produce just a ripple in the hematopoietic ocean.},

Using a classic, well-studied model of tumor evolution (a passenger-driver mutation model) we systematically alter spatial constraints and cell mixing rates to show how tissue structure influences functional (driver) mutations and genetic heterogeneity over time. This approach explores a key mechanism behind both inter-patient and intratumoral tumor heterogeneity: competition for space. Time-varying competition leads to an emergent transition from Darwinian premalignant growth to subsequent invasive neutral tumor growth. Initial spatial constraints determine the emergent mode of evolution (Darwinian to neutral) without a change in cell-specific mutation rate or fitness effects. Driver acquisition during the Darwinian precancerous stage may be modulated en route to neutral evolution by the combination of two factors: spatial constraints and limited cellular mixing. These two factors occur naturally in ductal carcinomas, where the branching topology of the ductal network dictates spatial constraints and mixing rates.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Contact-inhibition of proliferation constrains epithelial tissue growth, and the loss of contact-inhibition is a hallmark of cancer cells. In most physiological scenarios, cell–cell contact inhibits proliferation in the presence of other growth-promoting cues, such as soluble growth factors (GFs). How cells quantitatively reconcile the opposing effects of cell–cell contact and GFs, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), remains unclear. Here, using quantitative analysis of single cells within multicellular clusters, we show that contact is not a “master switch” that overrides EGF. Only when EGF recedes below a threshold level, contact inhibits proliferation, causing spatial patterns in cell cycle activity within epithelial cell clusters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the onset of contact-inhibition and the timing of spatial patterns in proliferation may be reengineered. Using micropatterned surfaces to amplify cell–cell interactions, we induce contact-inhibition at a higher threshold level of EGF. Using a complementary molecular genetics approach to enhance cell–cell interactions by overexpressing E-cadherin also increases the threshold level of EGF at which contact-inhibition is triggered. These results lead us to propose a state diagram in which epithelial cells transition from a contact-uninhibited state to a contact-inhibited state at a critical threshold level of EGF, a property that may be tuned by modulating the extent of cell–cell contacts. This quantitative model of contact-inhibition has direct implications for how tissue size may be determined and deregulated during development and tumor formation, respectively, and provides design principles for engineering epithelial tissue growth in applications such as tissue engineering.</p>},

   abstract = {Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is a branch of mathematics which considers populations of individuals interacting with each other to receive pay-offs. An individual's pay-off is dependent on the strategy of its opponent(s) as well as on its own, and the higher its pay-off, the higher its reproductive fitness. Its offspring generally inherit its interaction strategy, subject to random mutation. Over time, the composition of the population shifts as different strategies spread or are driven extinct. In the last 25 years there has been a flood of interest in applying EGT to cancer modelling, with the aim of explaining how cancerous mutations spread through healthy tissue and how intercellular cooperation persists in tumour-cell populations. This review traces this body of work from theoretical analyses of well-mixed infinite populations through to more realistic spatial models of the development of cooperation between epithelial cells. We also consider work in which EGT has been used to make experimental predictions about the evolution of cancer, and discuss work that remains to be done before EGT can make large-scale contributions to clinical treatment and patient outcomes.},

The dynamics are complex, with highly variable patterns of genetic diversity and resulting clonal architecture. Therapeutic intervention may destroy cancer clones and erode their habitats, but it can also inadvertently provide a potent selective pressure for the expansion of resistant variants. The inherently Darwinian character of cancer is the primary reason for this therapeutic failure, but it may also hold the key to more effective control.},

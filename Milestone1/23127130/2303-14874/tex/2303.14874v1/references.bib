	Abstract = {Purpose IEEE Ontologies for Robotics and Automation Working Group were divided into subgroups that were in charge of studying industrial robotics, service robotics and autonomous robotics. This paper aims to present the work in-progress developed by the autonomous robotics (AuR) subgroup. This group aims to extend the core ontology for robotics and automation to represent more specific concepts and axioms that are commonly used in autonomous robots.Design/methodology/approach For autonomous robots, various concepts for aerial robots, underwater robots and ground robots are described. Components of an autonomous system are defined, such as robotic platforms, actuators, sensors, control, state estimation, path planning, perception and decision-making.Findings AuR has identified the core concepts and domains needed to create an ontology for autonomous robots.Practical implications AuR targets to create a standard ontology to represent the knowledge and reasoning needed to create autonomous systems that comprise robots that can operate in the air, ground and underwater environments. The concepts in the developed ontology will endow a robot with autonomy, that is, endow robots with the ability to perform desired tasks in unstructured environments without continuous explicit human guidance.Originality/value Creating a standard for knowledge representation and reasoning in autonomous robotics will have a significant impact on all R\&A domains, such as on the knowledge transmission among agents, including autonomous robots and humans. This tends to facilitate the communication among them and also provide reasoning capabilities involving the knowledge of all elements using the ontology. This will result in improved autonomy of autonomous systems. The autonomy will have considerable impact on how robots interact with humans. As a result, the use of robots will further benefit our society. Many tedious tasks that currently can only be performed by humans will be performed by robots, which will further improve the quality of life. To the best of the authors'knowledge, AuR is the first group that adopts a systematic approach to develop ontologies consisting of specific concepts and axioms that are commonly used in autonomous robots.},

The goal of this survey is to focus on the perspective of user profiling and behavioral adaptation. On the one hand, human-robot interaction requires a human-oriented perception to model and recognize the human actions and capabilities, the intentions and goals behind such actions, and the parameters characterizing the social interaction. On the other hand, the robot behavior should be adapted in its physical movement within the space, in the actions to be selected to achieve collaboration, and by modulating the parameters characterizing the interaction. In this direction, this survey of the current literature introduces a general classification scheme for both the profiling and the behavioral adaptation research topics in terms of physical, cognitive, and social interaction viewpoints.},

	Abstract = {Modern production systems are increasingly using artificial agents (e.g., robots) of different kinds. Ideally, these agents should be able to recognize the state of the world, to act optimizing their work toward the achievement of a set of goals, to change the plan of action when problems arise, and to collaborate with other artificial and human agents. The development of such an ideal agent presents several challenges. We concentrate on two of them: the construction of a single and coherent knowledge base which includes different types of knowledge with which to understand and reason on the state of the world in a human-like way; and the isolation of types of contexts that the agent can exploit to make sense of the actual situation from a perspective and to interact accordingly with humans. We show how to build such a knowledge base (KB) and how it can be updated as time passes. The KB we propose is based on a foundational ontology, is cognitively inspired, and includes a notion of context to discriminate information. The KB has been partially implemented to test the use and suitability of the knowledge representation for the agent's control model via a temporal planning and execution system. Some experimental results showing the feasibility of our approach are reported.},

	Abstract = {The deployment of autonomous robots capable to both socially interact and proactively offer support to human users in a common life scenario remains challenging despite the recent technical advancements. For instance, research for endowing autonomous robots with the capability of acting in ``non-ideal'' and partially observable environments as well as socially interacting with humans is still an area in which improvements are specifically needed. To this aim, this paper elaborates on the need for integrating different Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to foster the development of personal robotic assistants continuously supporting older adults. Recently, the authors have been working on proposing an AI-based cognitive architecture that integrates knowledge representation and automated planning techniques in order to endow assistive robots with proactive and context situated abilities. This paper particularly describes a goal triggering mechanism to allow a robot to reason over the status of the user and the living environment with the aim of dynamically generating high-level goals to be planned accordingly.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the work done on a telepresence robot named GIRAFF and part of a telecare AAL system derived from the GIRAFFPLUS project for supporting and monitoring elderly people at home. Specifically, from the long term trials in real houses, a number of user requirements have emerged that inspired changes and improvements on the robotic platform. The implementation of both multimodal communication capabilities and enhanced information services introduced new interesting questions related to human-robot interaction and specifically to usability, valence of interaction, and cognitive load required to interact with and through the robot. An experimental session based on a combination of physiological and psychological methods showed that the enhanced platform is usable, the interaction pleasant and the required workload limited. The analysis of psychophysiological correlates supported the findings from self-report measures and provides further information. It has been possible to discriminate physiological responses between multimodal interaction and the use of new services. Specifically, while usability can be specifically related to the usage of multichannel commands, positive emotions elicited by the interaction with GIRAFF seems to be mostly ascribable to the usage of services provided for the communication with another person.},

The language has roughly the the expressiveness of Pednault's ADL [10] for propositions, and roughly the expressiveness of UMCP [6] for actions. Our hope is to encourage empirical evaluation of planner performance, and development of standard sets of problems all in comparable notations.}},

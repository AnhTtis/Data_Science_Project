    "abstract": "Currently, transport planning has changed its paradigm from projects oriented to guarantee service levels to projects oriented to guarantee accessibility to opportunities. In this context, a number of studies and tools aimed at calculating accessibility are being made available, however these tools depend on job location data that are not always easily accessible. Thus, this work proposes the creation of a database with the locations of formal jobs in Brazilian cities. The method uses the RAIS jobs database and the CNEFE street faces database to infer the location of jobs in urban regions from the zip code and the number of non-residential addresses on street faces. As a result, jobs can be located more accurately in large and medium-sized cities and approximately in single zip code cities. Finally, the databases are made available openly so that researchers and planning professionals can easily apply accessibility analyzes throughout the national territory.",

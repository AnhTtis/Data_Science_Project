    "abstract": "It was conjectured by Milnor in 1968 that the fundamental group of a complete manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature is finitely generated. The main result of this paper is a counterexample, which provides an example $M^7$ with ${\\rm Ric}\\geq 0$ such that $π_1(M)=\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$ is infinitely generated.\n  There are several new points behind the result. The first is a new topological construction for building manifolds with infinitely generated fundamental groups, which can be interpreted as a smooth version of the fractal snowflake. The ability to build such a fractal structure will rely on a very twisted gluing mechanism. Thus the other new point is a careful analysis of the mapping class group $π_0\\text{Diff}(S^3\\times S^3)$ and its relationship to Ricci curvature. In particular, a key point will be to show that the action of $π_0\\text{Diff}(S^3\\times S^3)$ on the standard metric $g_{S^3\\times S^3}$ lives in a path connected component of the space of metrics with ${\\rm Ric}>0$.",

    "abstract": "The virtual braid group $VB_n$, the virtual twin group $VT_n$ and the virtual triplet group $VL_n$ are extensions of the symmetric group $S_n$, which are motivated by the Alexander-Markov correspondence for virtual knot theories. The kernels of natural epimorphisms of these groups onto the symmetric group $S_n$ are the pure virtual braid group $VP_n$, the pure virtual twin group $PVT_n$ and the pure virtual triplet group $PVL_n$, respectively. In this paper, we investigate commutator subgroups, pure subgroups and crystallographic quotients of these groups. We derive explicit finite presentations of the pure virtual triplet group $PVL_n$, the commutator subgroup $VT_n^{'}$ of $VT_n$ and the commutator subgroup $VL_n^{'}$ of $VL_n$. Our results complete the understanding of these groups, except that of $VB_n^{'}$, for which the existence of a finite presentations is not known for $n \\ge 4$. We also prove that $VL_n/PVL_n^{'}$ is a crystallographic group and give an explicit construction of infinitely many torsion elements in it.",

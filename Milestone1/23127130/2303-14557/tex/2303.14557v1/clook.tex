\section{Introduction}
Time is a fascinating concept, encompassing both objective and subjective dimensions. On one hand, it can be precisely measured and represented through the steady, periodic movement of a clock's hands. On the other hand, time can feel fluid and elusive, easily slipping away unnoticed as we become engrossed in our tasks. 

Furthermore, time is a universal experience that connects us across the world. When it is 3 AM in Boston, it is also 3 PM in Beijing, and this shared knowledge allows us to communicate across vast time zones without social faux pas.

Disney movies like \textit{Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs}~\cite{snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs} and \textit{Beauty and the Beast}~\cite{beauty-and-the-beast} bring ordinary objects to life, imbuing them with human-like emotions and behavior. What if a clock could have its own distinct character too? What if it had the ability to see and interact with humans in its unique way? This thought-provoking concept opens up intriguing possibilities for human-clock interactions that are both playful and creative.

Motivated by the desire to explore the intricacies of human-time interaction~\cite{mcgrath1986time}, I designed and built the Clo(o)k - a clock that looks.

% The system is flexible: you can print your frames and customize movements. 

\section{Related Work}
Previous research has explored the practical use of clock, such as visualizing upcoming event~\cite{10.1145/506443.506505}, tracking sleep patterns~\cite{10.1145/1517664.1517672}, and supporting planning and reflection~\cite{10.1145/3334480.3382830,10.1145/3357236.3395439}. However, this work takes a more playful approach to clock design, aiming to create an interactive experience that encourages users to reflect on the concept of time. 

In a similar vein, telepresence technology has used various sensory modalities, including sound~\cite{10.1145/1935701.1935705}, touch~\cite{10.1145/1120212.1120435,10.1145/2642918.2647377}, and sight~\cite{10.1145/142750.142977} to enable people to feel the presence of others even when they are far apart. This work builds upon these ideas by exploring how time can be integrated into such interactions, creating new possibilities for connecting with others across time and space.



\section{Interactions}
This section showcases three interactive applications using the Clo(o)k, as depicted in Figures~\ref{fig:1}, \ref{fig:2}, and \ref{fig:3}.

\section{\cl{} System}
This section details the design and construction process of the \cl{}. The relevant files are available for download at \href{https://zhuoyuelyu.com/clook}{\textbf{zhuoyuelyu.com/clook}}.

% 这里全用过去时也不对，全现在时似乎也不对...咋搞嘞
\subsection{Design}
To achieve a simple and clean design for \cl{}, I used basic shapes, such as circles and triangles, to represent the clock face and base. The camera is positioned at the center of the clock face to maintain the appearance of a standard clock. This subtle placement allows users to initially perceive it as a normal clock, only to be pleasantly surprised by its intriguing behavior once they realize the central element is actually a camera. However, this design choice meant that the traditional clock mechanism, where all hands are attached to the centerpiece, could not be used. To overcome this, I utilized the hollow clock mechanism~\cite{hallow-clock} - the minute and hour hands are two rings driven by two sets of gears hidden in the base (Figure~\ref{fig:gear}). 

% \begin{figure}[htb!]

\begin{figure}[!htb]

   \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{pic/clook-5.jpg}
    \caption{These gears drive the rings.}
     \label{fig:gear}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Fabrication}
The 3D design was created using Fusion 360~\cite{fusion-360} and Blender~\cite{blender}, and then exported as STL files to be printed. The rings and gears were printed with PLA using Prusa~\cite{prusa}, while the hands were spray-painted red. The base (Figure~\ref{fig:base}) was printed using Fuse 1~\cite{fuse1} with powder for better quality.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic/clook-2.jpg}
    \caption{The base that holds everything.}
     \label{fig:base}
\end{figure}





\subsection{Hardware}
% TODO: 讲到的每个hardware最好都在图片里面指出来是哪个否则外人不知道鸭...
\cl{} utilizes an ESP32-CAM~\cite{esp32-cam} with a modified lens to capture the video, control one of the stepper motors, and wirelessly communicate with the computer and other clocks. A D11C~\cite{d11c} board was designed and milled to extend the pins of the ESP32-CAM so it can receive the serial signal from the ESP32-CAM to control another stepper motor. Two 28BYJ-48 stepper motors~\cite{stepper} with driver boards are used to control the rings. An FTDI Converter~\cite{ftdi} is used to program ESP32-CAM and provide the power (Figure~\ref{fig:10}).

\subsection{Software}
% TODO 讲一下怎么检测三个interaction的，或者写在interaction那里？就是靠几个人头这样...
Both ESP32-CAM and D11C were programmed using Arduino~\cite{arduino}. Although there is a reduced version of OpenCV~\cite{opencv-esp32} for ESP32-CAM, for more flexibility and convenience,  a separate laptop running Python script using OpenCV~\cite{opencv} is used for facial detection, which gets the video stream from ESP32-CAM wirelessly. ESP32-CAM updates the movements of the stepper motors based on the information (number of faces) it receives from Python through the USB serial connection.

\section{Feedback and Limitations}
\cl{} was showcased at an Open House event at the MIT Media Lab, attended by over 100 participants. Below are some of the feedback and comments gathered during the event.
\begin{itemize}
\item Attendees consistently smiled upon hearing about the user interactions with the clock, finding the exploration of time's dual nature – both subjective and objective – particularly intriguing.
\item The minimalist design of the clock caught the attention of many participants, and they were pleasantly surprised to learn that the rings were detachable from the base.
\item Several international students, who have loved ones living in different time zones, found the third interaction to be incredibly useful. They appreciated the ability to feel a sense of presence from their distant family and friends.
\end{itemize}






However, there are still areas for improvement that can be addressed:

\begin{itemize}
\item The poor lighting conditions affected the system's ability to accurately identify faces.
\item The serial connections between ESP32-CAM and D11C were slightly laggy, resulting in a noticeable delay between the minute hand and hour hand.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

% \vspace{-0.5cm}
\end{figure}

% One participant suggested since the rings are detachable, there could be more rings, where different rings represent different things or people. They said the ring itself could also be combined with different LED lighting to provide richer information.

\section{Future Work}
\cl{} is a versatile system that offers a multitude of potential interactions. The three interactions presented in this paper are just examples of what can be achieved. The detachable rings provide the opportunity to explore different ring styles and the novel interactions they can generate. For instance, users can customize their rings to suit their preferences (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ring} on the left), or turn them into storytelling devices (as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ring} on the right). As such, in addition to addressing the current limitations of the system and performing formal evaluations, further research will be pursued conducted to explore the vast possibilities for interactions that \cl{} can offer.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents the design and build of \cl{}, a system that supports playful interactions with time. This work proposes an innovative approach to employing a tangible, everyday object for stimulating reflections on intangible concepts such as time. It is hoped that this research will inspire further exploration and spark new ideas within the CHI community.

abstract = {In this paper, we present SpiraClock, a new visualization technique for nearby events. SpiraClock fills a gap between static calendar displays and pop-up reminders by giving the user a continuous and non-intrusive feedback on nearby events. Events are displayed inside an analog clock that can be used as a regular computer clock. We used SpiraClock for displaying bus schedules, and collected user feedback.},

abstract = {This paper presents the Digital Hourglass, an alarm clock that focuses on the amount of sleep, rather than wake-up times. It follows a simple approach, lighting one LED for each hour of sleep, and physically resembles the interaction with a conventional hourglass: Tilting the hourglass moves 'time' between its chambers, placing it in an upright position activates it, turning it by 180° snoozes it and placing it horizontally on a surface turns it off.},

abstract = {Time and its lack of play a central role in our everyday lives. Despite increasing productivity, many people experience "time stress" exhaustion and longing for time affluence, and at the same time, a fear of not being busy enough. All this leads to a neglect of natural time, especially the patterns and rhythms created by physiological processes, subsumed under the heading of chronobiology. The present paper presents and evaluates a calendar application, which uses chronobiological knowledge to support people's planning activities. Participants found our calendar to be interesting and engaging. It especially made them think more about their bodies and appropriate times for particular activities. All in all, it supported participants in negotiating external demands and personal health and wellbeing. This shows that technology does not necessarily has to be neutral or even further current (mal-)practices. Our calendar cares about changing perspectives and thus about enhancing users' wellbeing.},

abstract = {We introduce DayClo, an interactive clock visualizing schedule data for supporting users to reflect and self-track themselves in their daily lives. DayClo is designed by applying the form and time representation method of analog clocks. It shows the user's upcoming schedules through the sequential movement of two clock hands with hidden LEDs and a display. We deployed DayClo in eight participants' working spaces for a month to explore how the design and its interaction could support their reflections on their scheduling practices. The findings revealed that DayClo supported users' casual access to the schedule data and motivated self-tracking of their plans. Moreover, the moving clock hands revealed the empty time of their schedules and helped to draw new plans for their implicit goal. Our findings suggest new opportunities for designing everyday objects as a medium of delivering and fostering spontaneous interaction with personal data for self-reflection.},

abstract = {Playing a musical instrument involves a complex set of continuous gestures, both to play the notes and to convey expression. To learn an instrument, a student must learn not only the music itself but also how to perform these bodily gestures. We present MirrorFugue, a set of three interfaces on a piano keyboard designed to visualize hand gesture of a remote collaborator. Based their spatial configurations, we call our interfaces Shadow, Reflection, and Organ. We describe the configurations and detail studies of our designs on synchronous, remote collaboration, focusing specifically on remote lessons for beginners. Based on our evaluations, we conclude that displaying the to-scale hand gestures of a teacher at the locus of interaction can improve remote piano learning for novices.},

In this paper, we describe the concept of shape transmission, and propose interaction techniques to manipulate remote physical objects and physical renderings of shared digital content. We investigate how the representation of user's body parts can be altered to amplify their capabilities for teleoperation. We also describe the details of building and testing prototype Physical Telepresence workspaces based on shape displays. A preliminary evaluation shows how users are able to manipulate remote objects, and we report on our observations of several different manipulation techniques that highlight the expressive nature of our system.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel shared drawing medium called ClearBoard. It realizes (1) a seamless shared drawing space and (2) eye contact to support realtime and remote collaboration by two users. We devised the key metaphor: “talking through and drawing on a transparent glass window” to design ClearBoard. A prototype of ClearBoard is implemented based on the “Drafter-Mirror” architecture. This paper first reviews previous work on shared drawing support to clarify the design goals. We then examine three methaphors that fulfill these goals. The design requirements and the two possible system architectures of ClearBoard are described. Finally, some findings gained through the experimental use of the prototype, including the feature of “gaze awareness”, are discussed.},

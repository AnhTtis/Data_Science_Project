  abstract = "This paper (see also [1]) extends the alternating Turing machine (A-TM) of Chandra, Kozen and Stockmeyer [2], the private and the blind alternating machines of Reif [3,4] to model multiplayer games of incomplete information. We use these machines to provide matching lower bounds for our decision algorithms described in our companion paper [5]. We also apply multiple person alternation to other machine types.\par
     We show that multiplayer games of incomplete information can be undecidable general. However, one form of incomplete information games that is decidable we term as hierarchical games (defined later in this paper). In hierarchical multiplayer games, each additional clique (subset of players with same information) increases the complexity of the outcome problem by a further exponential. Consequently, if a multiplayer game of incomplete information with $k$ cliques has a space bound of $S(n)$, then its outcome can be $k$ repeated exponentials harder than games of complete information with the same space bound $S(n)$. This paper proves that this exponential blow-up must occur in the worst case.\par
     We define TEAM-PRIVATE-PEEK and TEAM-BLIND-PEEK, extending the previous models of PEEK. These new games can be shown to be complete for their respective classes. We use these games to establish lower bounds on complexity of multiplayer games of incomplete information and blindfold multiplayer games.\par
     We analyze the time bounded alternating machines, and conclude that time is not a very critical resource for multiplayer alternation. We also show DQBF (a variant of QBF) to be complete in NEXPTIME.",

Bounded synthesis is the approach to bound the maximum size of the system that we accept as a solution to the reactive synthesis problem. As a result, bounded synthesis is decidable whenever the corresponding verification problem is decidable, and can be applied in settings where classic synthesis fails, such as in the synthesis of distributed systems. In this paper, we study the constraint solving problem behind bounded synthesis. We consider different reductions of the bounded synthesis problem of linear-time temporal logic (LTL) to constraint systems given as boolean formulas (SAT), quantified boolean formulas (QBF), and dependency quantified boolean formulas (DQBF). The reductions represent different trade-offs between conciseness and algorithmic efficiency. In the SAT encoding, both inputs and states of the system are represented explicitly; in QBF, inputs are symbolic and states are explicit; in DQBF, both inputs and states are symbolic. We evaluate the encodings systematically using benchmarks from the reactive synthesis competition (SYNTCOMP) and state-of-the-art solvers. Our key, and perhaps surprising, empirical finding is that QBF clearly dominates both SAT and DQBF.},

      Driven by the needs of various applications which
      can be encoded by DQBFs in a natural, compact, and elegant way,
      research on DQBF solving has emerged in the past few years.
      However, research focused on closed DQBFs in prenex form (where all quantifiers

      while non-prenex DQBFs have almost not been studied in the literature.
      In this paper, we provide a formal definition for syntax and semantics of
      non-closed non-prenex DQBFs and prove useful properties enabling quantifier localization.
      Moreover, we make use of our theory by integrating quantifier localization into
      a state-of-the-art DQBF solver. Experiments with prenex DQBF benchmarks, including all instances from
      the QBFEVAL'18--'20 competitions,

In this paper, we lift the clausal abstraction algorithm for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) to DQBF. Clausal abstraction for QBF is an abstraction refinement algorithm that operates on a sequence of abstractions that represent the different quantifier levels. For DQBF we need to generalize this principle to partial orders of abstractions. The two challenges to overcome are: (1) Clauses may contain literals with incomparable dependencies, which we address by the recently proposed proof rule called Fork Extension, and (2) existential variables may have spurious dependencies, which we prevent by tracking consistency requirements during the execution. Our implementation DCAQE solves significantly more formulas than the existing DQBF algorithms.},

    "abstract": "Generation and detection of entanglement is at the forefront of most quantum information technologies. There is a plethora of techniques that reveal entanglement on the basis of only partial information about the underlying quantum state including, in particular, entanglement witnesses. Superradiance refers to the phenomenon of highly synchronized photon emission from an ensemble of quantum emitters that is caused by correlations among the individual particles and has been connected by Dicke himself to the presence of multipartite entangled states. We investigate this connection in a quantitative way and discuss, whether or not signatures of superradiance from semiconductor nanolasers, manifesting themselves as a modification of the spontaneous-emission time, can be interpreted as a witness to detect entanglement in the underlying state of the emitters.",

    "abstract": "When students make a mistake in an exercise, they can consolidate it by ``similar exercises'' which have the same concepts, purposes and methods. Commonly, for a certain subject and study stage, the size of the exercise bank is in the range of millions to even tens of millions, how to find similar exercises for a given exercise becomes a crucial technical problem. Generally, we can assign a variety of explicit labels to the exercise, and then query through the labels, but the label annotation is time-consuming, laborious and costly, with limited precision and granularity, so it is not feasible. In practice, we define ``similar exercises'' as a retrieval process of finding a set of similar exercises based on recall, ranking and re-rank procedures, called the \\textbf{FSE} problem (Finding similar exercises). Furthermore, comprehensive representation of the semantic information of exercises was obtained through representation learning. In addition to the reasonable architecture, we also explore what kind of tasks are more conducive to the learning of exercise semantic information from pre-training and supervised learning. It is difficult to annotate similar exercises and the annotation consistency among experts is low. Therefore this paper also provides solutions to solve the problem of low-quality annotated data. Compared with other methods, this paper has obvious advantages in both architecture rationality and algorithm precision, which now serves the daily teaching of hundreds of schools.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates new technology for enhancing the sensitivity of low-mass dark matter detection by analyzing charge transport in a p-type germanium detector at 5.2 K. To achieve low-threshold detectors, precise calculations of the binding energies of dipole and cluster dipole states, as well as the cross-sections of trapping affected by the electric field, are essential. The detector was operated in two modes: depleted at 77 K before cooling to 5.2 K and cooled directly to 5.2 K with various bias voltages. Our results indicate that the second mode produces lower binding energies and suggests different charge states under varying operating modes. Notably, our measurements of the dipole and cluster dipole state binding energies at zero fields were $8.716\\pm 0.435$ meV and $6.138\\pm 0.308$ meV, respectively. These findings have strong implications for the development of low-threshold detectors for detecting low-mass dark matter in the future.",

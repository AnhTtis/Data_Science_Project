    "abstract": "We prove some nice properties of anti-homomorphisms, some of which are analogic to that of homomorphisms. Meanwhile, we develop a new kind of composition called $*$-composition such that the $*$-composition of two anti-homomorphisms is still an anti-homomorphism. Moreover, we develop a certain kind of categories called factorization categories, which generalize anti-homomorphisms and provide a general framework to study \"anti\" phenomenon. We deduce several results of anti-homomorphisms in great generality.",

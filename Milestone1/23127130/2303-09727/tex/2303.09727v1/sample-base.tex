% CONTEXT: To identify projects, the mining process can involve a data pipeline that extracts and reports findings, increasing the confidence in the results and ensuring reproducibility.

These findings can create research opportunities and potentially identify available open-source resources that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. \textit{Goals:} We mined GitHub to identify projects focusing on gender-related topics, helping better understand the open-source community's efforts and interests in this domain through active projects. Our goals are to report on a preponderance of projects focusing on certain gender topics and identify those topics with limited focus. This includes further examining projects focusing on gender bias and how they address this non-inclusive behaviour. \textit{Method:} We use an existing pipeline to identify active GitHub projects, applying quantitative methods to examine the projects' attributes and qualitative methods to classify them within a gender social structure and a gender bias taxonomy. \textit{Results:} Results show a propensity of GitHub projects focusing on recognition and detection of an individual's gender and a dearth of projects concentrating on the cultural expectations placed on women and men. In the gender bias domain, the projects mainly focus on occupational bias. These findings raise opportunities to address the limited focus on GitHub towards gender-related topics through the development of projects that mitigate exclusive behaviours.

\section{Introduction}

The open-source community uses GitHub to exchange and share software applications and services of interest to them. As of July 2022, GitHub had over 46 million public projects that can be used to report emerging technologies and trends across varying domains.\footnote{https://github.com/search?q=is:public} The paper's motivation is to identify the active gender-related projects by the open-source community on GitHub and report on a preponderance of projects focusing on specific gender topics and identify those topics with limited focus. We are interested in understanding the resources provided on GitHub by the open-source community that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. We define \textit{gender-related projects} as projects that focus on sexual discrimination, gender bias, and stereotyping, along with feminism, health, family, and sexuality \cite{runyan:2014}. These topics appear within society's gender structure, influencing the roles and norms created by society for women and men \cite{risman:2013} at different dimensions, such as individual and institutional.

To find active gender-related projects, we use data mining, a technique previously used on GitHub to find information on the changing landscape for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) \cite{gonzalez:2020}. Data mining helped understand librarians' usage of the GitHub platform \cite{eaton:2021}. Analysing and reporting on GitHub projects can be done using data pipelines, tools that perform data processing to allow researchers and organisations to understand the collected data better \cite{munappy:2020}. Prior research has mined GitHub to understand the gender dynamics during software development, such as the gender-biased behaviours during Pull Requests (PRs), a submission process for software changes \cite{terrell:2017}. We use a pipeline to identify the open-source community's interests in gender-related topics through projects currently active on GitHub. We use the following research questions to guide our study:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} \textit{How do the attributes of the gender-related projects compare to other active GitHub projects?}
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} \textit{How do the gender-related projects align within the gender social structure?}
    \item \textbf{RQ3:} \textit{What types of gender bias are actively explored within GitHub projects?}
\end{itemize}

%To identify available gender-related projects, we use a data pipeline \cite{shen:2019} designed for open-source clinical software projects. Though other pipelines exist, such as a pipeline to identify Internet of Things (IoT) projects on the open web \cite{hwang:2016}, we selected the clinical software pipeline because it provided analysis and visualisations appropriate for our research.

%In addition, there are frameworks, such as PyDriller \cite{spadini:2018} that supports researchers in developing pipelines, but we selected this pipeline because it provided analysis and visualisations we felt were appropriate for mining GitHub. 

%We reuse the pipeline to identify trends and characteristics in GitHub project focusing on gender issues and topics.

\end{itemize}
\fi

To answer the research questions, we apply a comparison study that uses quantitative and qualitative methods to analyse gender-related projects collected from a pipeline and compare them to a random selection of active GitHub projects to understand the open-source community's interests in this domain. The qualitative methods classify all gender-related projects within a gender social structure, helping to identify the concentration of GitHub projects within the gender social structure while opening future opportunities to address those areas with a narrow focus. We then align projects to a taxonomy focusing on gender bias, the conscious or unconscious awareness that influences a person's behaviour \cite{wang:2019} that can promote inequitable and non-inclusive environments. The open-source community might respond to gender bias through open-source services and applications, and we examine how they address this non-inclusive behaviour. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first attempt to identify and report on the open-source community's interest in gender-related topics on the GitHub platform. The results show 235 active projects where most focus on recognising and detecting an individual's gender, with a slight interest in interactional behaviours, the cultural expectations placed on men and women \cite{risman:2013}. Within the gender bias domain, most of the projects address occupational bias, with discrimination having minimal representation.

%The show 10175 gender-related GitHub projects created over a ten-year (2011-2021) period, with , such as facial and gender recognition software applications. Our findings show missing metadata in GitHub projects, a situation also observed by \citet{kalliamvakou:2014}, making it difficult and unreliably to identify the purpose of problems. 

%Our findings echo prior research [] missing metadata, such as keywords, programming languages and labels, making it difficult for users to identify projects.

%In addition, our work contributed to modifying the systematic review pipeline to make it generic for others to apply it to other research topics. We presented the work performed on the data pipeline to apply to other research areas.

\section{Background} \label{section_related_work}

%This section presents the background in two sections: Section \ref{subsection_bkgd_mining} discusses mining projects on GitHub and Section \ref{subsection_bkgd_gender} presents gender-related research within the open-source community.

\subsection{Mining GitHub Projects} \label{subsection_bkgd_mining}

%MSR enables researchers ``to support the maintenance of software systems, improve software design/reuse, and empirically validate novel ideas and techniques'' \cite[p.~89]{chaturvedi:2013}.

Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is a field of research that analyses data from software repositories and reports on the collected data \cite{herzig:2011}. Prior research has used MSR to examine gender diversity in software teams \cite{prana:2021}, identify the geolocations of GitHub contributors \cite{gousios:2014}, describe a Pull Development model \cite{gousios:2014}, and present the social features \cite{begel:2013} on GitHub. These exemplars demonstrate the diverse research opportunities from mining GitHub.

%Before Github, mining software was performed on SourceForge []. 
%Some of the previously mentioned research \cite{gousios:2014, gousios:2017} uses GHTorrent, using the collected timestamped data to mine software repositories. 

Technologies and tools are available to mine GitHub, such as the GitHub REST API used to create applications that extract data.\footnote{https://docs.github.com/en/rest} GHTorrent is a project that uses the GitHub REST API to collect, timestamp, and archive public projects.\footnote{https://ghtorrent.org} Like GHTorrent, GitHub Archive archives data hourly, making the data accessible via HTTP.\footnote{https://www.gharchive.org} Mining technologies can extract GitHub data, but additional work is required for interpretation since collected data can include biased results \cite{gousios:2017}, such as personal projects \cite{kalliamvakou:2014}. Avoidance strategies can identify active projects that contain a balance of commits, Pull Requests, and stars \cite{kalliamvakou:2014}. Stars represent interested users watching projects through update notifications \cite{zhang:2017}.

%Both GHTorrent and GH Archive provides historical data \cite{mombach:2018}. 
%since the findings ``can alter research conclusions if care is not taken to first establish that the data fits the research purpose'' \cite[p.~92]{kalliamvakou:2014}. 

 %A high number of project stars can signify a high-quality project []. 

%Query languages have also been developed to assist with mining GitHub projects. For example, Orion \cite{bissyande:2013} is a declarative query language that examines projects' metadata, their issue tracking systems, and source code to find relevant projects faster. Boa is another query language that provides users with a web interface to identify Java-based projects, reducing their programming efforts to find relevant projects \cite{dyer:2013}.

%MUDABlue also allowing the user to visualise the accurately categorised projects, along with providing the 
%Two techniques, CLAN (Closely reLated ApplicatioNs) and RepoPal, were evaluated by \cite{zhang:2017} to evaluate performance. 

%A comparison study \cite{zhang:2017} of these two techniques show RepoPal produced more accurate results than CLAN. 

%MUDABlue \cite{kawaguchi:2004} is a tool that identifies projects. Unlike RepoPal which uses metadata, MUDABlue examines the projects' source code, presenting the findings, such as their architectures and libraries, through a web interface.
%RepoPal is another technique that leverages projects' stars and \texttt{README} files to determine similarities. 

There are tools and techniques to mine projects. CLAN (Closely reLated ApplicatioNs) \cite{mcmillan:2012} is a technique that identifies similarities between Java projects through API method calls. A tool, \texttt{reaper} \cite{munaiah:2017}, identifies engineered software projects on GitHub. These projects leverage ``sound software engineering practices in one or more of its dimensions such as documentation, testing, and project management'' \cite[p.~3222]{munaiah:2017}. The \texttt{reaper} tool removes biased results, such as assignment projects, and identified 24.07\% of the 1,857,423 queried projects as engineered software projects. Frameworks support pipeline construction, like PyDriller \cite{spadini:2018}, a Python-based framework that reduces the complexity of mining projects but does not have features for presenting the findings. The tools, techniques, and mining approaches presented in this section provide researchers with various methods to construct pipelines for finding and reporting on extracted GitHub data. However, these approaches mainly focus on programming-related projects and our interests include software development projects and gender-related projects residing in other application domains, such as gender policy. 

%But through our research, we demonstrate how researchers can reuse existing pipelines for their data mining research. 

%Though these techniques find projects, additional work is required to analyse and report the findings.

%Seven dimensions were identified to establish engineered software projects, such as community, continuous integration, documentation, history, issues, license, and unit testing. Through the use of \texttt{reaper},

\vspace{-1mm}\subsection{Gender-Related Research in the Open-Source Community} \label{subsection_bkgd_gender}

%Because our research focus on gender issues and topics within GitHub, 
%We identify gender in OSS because it is well established that women are under-represented in the computing disciplines. In 2016 in the United States, 19\% of the CS Bachelor's degrees were awarded to women, a record decline from the 27\% awarded in 1997 \cite{nces:2016}.
%A report \cite{robles:2010} from 2016 shows that 2-5\% of the open-source participation comes from female contributors.

%The under-representation of women in Tech could be explained by the \textit{Social Construction Theory}. The theory argues socio-cultural factors influence the relationship people have with technologies \cite{marini:1990}, potentially contributing to the perception that Tech is a male domain.

We review the literature on gender-related topics within the open-source community to understand better how our work resides in this research area. One research area examines gender diversity in software teams, demonstrating women are under-represented as project contributors \cite{powell:2010}. A 2019 study \cite{bosu:2019} showed that 10\% of the GitHub project contributors were women, with 2.3\% comprising the core developers  \cite{canedo:2020}. This gender imbalance within teams can influence software products. For example, the under-representation of female developers within the FLOSS community has resulted in more unfriendly software towards women \cite{lin:2005}. Equal gender representation in software teams can bring together different perspectives and approaches to the development process; however, ``the software development profession does not reflect the people who use technology'' \cite[p.~20]{albusays:2021}. Gender diversity within teams can promote higher team performance \cite{rogelberg:1996}, helping to reduce \textit{community smells} \cite{catolino:2019} and the sub-optimal conditions within the software development communities \cite{tamburri:2015}. Diverse teams can handle issues well and resolve disagreements quickly \cite{earley:2000}, leading to higher team performance. A study \cite{vasilescu:2015} examining software commits showed diverse teams were more productive, concluding gender diversity can positively influence team productivity. To promote team diversity, Vasilescu et al. \cite{vasilescu:2015} suggest educational and professional incentives, such as training and outreach programs, to increase the presence of female contributors.

%Though there is support for having diversity in the software development process, there is gender differences in the open-source software development community, 

%A potential reason for the under-representation of women in the open-source community is the barriers they encounter within the community. 

Another research area examines causes for the under-representation of women in open source. Barriers, such as sexism and inequitable pay \cite{trinkenreich:2022}, challenge gender diversity and are a form of gender bias previously observed during the Pull Requests (PRs) process. PRs are source code changes that project maintainers review and comment on before acceptance \cite{kononenko:2018}. Terrell et al. \cite{terrell:2017} conducted a study that demonstrated when women's gender was identifiable during PRs, their requests were more likely to be rejected than male contributors. Another study by Imtiaz et al. \cite{imtiaz:2019} used a framework \cite{williams:2014} to examine contributors' GitHub PRs. The framework describes workplace patterns that influence women's career advancements. This study concluded that women concentrated their efforts on smaller sections of projects and a smaller group of organisations. Another study \cite{lee:2019} surveyed FLOSS contributors to collect their awareness of gender bias in the community, showing contributors' awareness of gender bias during software collaboration. Still, some contributors ``did not see the purpose of attempting to be inclusive, expressing that a discussion of gender has no place in FLOSS'' \cite[p.~677]{lee:2019}. Lee and Carver \cite{lee:2019} suggest a zero-tolerance policy for sexist behaviours to reduce challenges and make open source more inclusive. Women in the software industry recommend establishing role models and mentoring and creating inclusive events and groups to mitigate barriers \cite{trinkenreich:2022}.

The literature presented in this section examines gender disparity and bias women encounter in the open-source community. We reviewed literature that uses mining techniques on open-source projects to understand the diversity and dynamics in software teams. However, from reviewing the literature and to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to identify the open-source community’s interests in gender-related topics through open-source projects.

%s In a survey with Free-Libre/Open-Source Software (FLOSS) contributors across 15 projects, they were aware of gender bias in the community, such as sexism. 

%[ADD CONTENT] female contributors encounter with OSS culture \cite{holliger:2007}.

%Evaluating gender on GitHub has been performed in various areas on the platform, examining the diversity of contributors \cite{prana:2021} and the acceptance of Pull Requests by genders []. 

%Our literature review demonstrates prior work examining gender related topics, such as diversity and inclusion, in the OSS community, but prior research exploring gender on GitHub examined diversity with contributors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt examining GitHub projects that focus on gender issues and topics.

\section{Research Methodology} \label{section_study_method}

%This section presents the methods we used to report our findings. Section \ref{subsection_pipeline_design} describes the changes we made to the data pipeline, while Section \ref{subsection_data_collection} describes the how the information was extracted from the repositories. Section \ref{subsection_qual_analysis} describes the qualitative analysis performed on the projects that have high interest and software development.
 
We use a comparison study \cite{coccia:2018}, applying quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate gender-related projects. Figure \ref{fig:data_pipeline_figure} presents an overview of how the data is collected (See Section \ref{section_pipeline_design}) and active projects selected (See Section \ref{subsection_selection_criteria}). Section \ref{subsection_quan_analysis} describes the quantitative analysis that compares attributes of the active gender-related projects with a random selection of active GitHub projects, indicating the level of interest in the gender-related projects. We refer to the random selection of the active GitHub projects as the \textit{baseline dataset} in Figure \ref{fig:data_pipeline_figure}. The qualitative analysis (See Section \ref{subsection_qual_analysis}) provides an in-depth view of the active GitHub projects. The comma-separated values (CSV) files discussed in this section are in our online appendix hosted on Figshare.\footnote{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19619034}

%The pipeline supports our work in initially identifying gender-related GitHub projects. Because the pipeline helps in identifying all the gender-related projects, we apply the selection criteria, described in 

%to establish the active projects. This step is shown in Figure \ref{fig:data_pipeline_figure} and is the first manual intervention performed in the research methodology. The remaining manual interventions perform analysis of the collected data. 

\subsection{Data Pipeline} \label{section_pipeline_design}

%In this section, we describe the data pipeline used in this research. We present the pipeline's design, which includes how it extracts and analyses the data.

%\subsection{Pipeline Structure and Data Extraction} %\label{subsection_pipeline_structure}

%The pipeline performs both numeric and textual analysis. The figure shows the analysis process with the textual analysis being an option section in the pipeline. The additional findings are related to the projects' \texttt{README} files and association to research publications. %Other mining approaches use GHTorrent due to time and cost \cite{gousios:2017}. A prior meta-analysis has shown 

 

%The original data pipeline by \citet{shen:2019} processes required information to use the pipeline, such as logins, passwords, and API tokens, through different mechanisms. Some of this information was embedded in the pipeline or extracted as operating system environment variables. 

%The initial search keywords used was \textit{``gender'' OR ``bias''}, but this produced unrelated repositories, such as a pool-based blockchain tool \cite{artefact2:2022} for bitcoin mining. When reducing the keyword search to \textit{``gender''}, we received results appropriate for our research goals. In addition, we did not want to narrow the scope with another keyword, such as \textit{``language''} since that also produced misleading results, such as bringing people together using \textit{gitdate} \cite{gitdate:2022} for matching people's interests in programming languages. Instead, the \textit{``gender''} keyword and manually evaluated the repositories based on the \textit{Description} field. 

%The first script, \texttt{query\_query.py}, queries GitHub using a query string defined in the script. We switched the query string from \textit{``(clinical OR medical) OR (patient OR doctor)''} identifies clinical open-source software and replaced the query string with \textit{``(gender)''}. By using \textit{``gender''}, we wanted to capture all projects related to this term. Like the clinical open-source software search, our query also focused on English language-based projects. We set the query search for a ten-year (2011-2021) period, 

We used a Python-based pipeline (See Figure \ref{fig:data_pipeline_figure}, ``Open-Source Clinical Software Project'') by Shen and Spruit \cite{shen:2019} that identifies open-source clinical software projects for reuse in the healthcare industry. This pipeline was selected for its extraction and analysis features, allowing us to mine GitHub projects within a different domain. Though other pipelines exist, such as a pipeline to identify Internet of Things (IoT) projects on the open web \cite{hwang:2016} and a Validation Pipeline \cite{hardle:2017} that evaluates YAML annotated software projects, these pipelines do not report the data necessary for this study's qualitative analysis (See Section \ref{subsection_qual_analysis}). 

%We used two scripts, where Figure \ref{fig:data_pipeline_figure} displays the scripts' features available in the scripts but displays the features and analysis processes we applied to our research. 

% and Plotly Chart Studio\footnote{https://plotly.com/python/chart-studio}

%and to save the generated files to a different directory on the local computer. 

%Reusing a data pipeline required setup, which included creating a token for the GitHub REST API and two accounts for the IBM-Watson and Plotly Chart Studio APIs. 

The pipeline uses the GitHub REST API to collect data, querying projects' ``name, description, \texttt{README} files, stars, forks, the number of contributors, and the number of commits'' \cite[p.~3]{shen:2019}. The pipeline provides the query as a string which we modified to \textit{``gender''}, identifying English-based projects created over ten years (2012-2021). The query results were saved as a CSV file, storing the projects' 17 attributes as separate columns. Table \ref{tbl:extracted_data} presents the attributes, organising them alphabetically within their data types: numerical and textual. 

%The pipeline does not analyse the numeric data, which required the authors to perform the quantitative analysis. We describe this analysis process in Section \ref{subsection_quan_analysis}. 

%Shen and Spruit \cite{shen:2019} used the query {``clinical''} to demonstrate the number of projects using this term but refined to \textit{``(clinical OR medical) OR (patient OR doctor'')} to exclude biological research, such as genome sequencing. We decided on one keyword \textit{``gender''} to identify as many projects as possible within the gender domain.

%The \texttt{github\_query.py} script was executed ten times, where the primary author adjusted the search date for each year because the GitHub REST API has a quota on querying data that impeded data collection \cite{cosentino:2016}. The latest GitHub REST API documentation\footnote{https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api\#rate-limiting} explains the requests vary depending on the user's account. The Basic Account can perform 5,000 requests per hour, while an Enterprise Cloud Account can perform 15,000 requests per hour. 

We examined the CSV file for data corruption that would impact our analysis and found two projects with corrupted data in the \textit{Description} field. Then, we used the pipeline for textual analysis on the \textit{Description} field to identify informative keywords. IBM-Watson was used for the textual analysis, saving the results to a CSV file for qualitative analysis (See Section \ref{subsection_qual_analysis}) to classify the projects.\footnote{https://pypi.org/project/ibm-watson} 

%The pipeline generates informative keywords using IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding, Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies insightful words from the projects' \textit{Description} fields, storing the results as a CSV file.\footnote{https://www.ibm.com/au-en/cloud/watson-natural-language-understanding} 

%Watson Natural Language Understanding is an activity that performs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate a list of projects' descriptive keywords. ``Natural Language Processing (in short, NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that mainly uses machine learning to linguistically analyse text'' \cite[p.~105]{quarteroni:2018}. 

%Textual analysis was then performed in the script using the generated keywords. This included creating lists and a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model that clusters the keywords to help realise projects' themes. 

%ascertains topics from projects' keywords 

%The \texttt{data\_analysis.py} script also provides a visualisation of the project owners' geolocations. For geolocations, manual intervention by the authors was required to adjust the project owners' locations, converting them to country codes. For example, \textit{``Berlin''}, and \textit{``University of California, Berkeley''} were converted to \texttt{``DEU''} and \texttt{``USA''}, respectively. Some project owners provided more than one location, such as \textit{``NY | Tokyo''}. Multiple locations were removed from the geolocation dataset, to avoid misrepresentation of the number of owners in the identified projects. The country codes were aggregated in a separate CSV file, \texttt{allGenderRelatedProjects\_CountryCodes.csv}, to create the geolocation visualisation. Though the pipeline has a feature to generate a geolocation visualisation, the authors generated the visualisation outside the pipeline because it assumed a certain data model that did not align with the authors generated CSV file, using the same technology \textemdash~Plotly's world choropleth map\footnote{https://plotly.com/python/choropleth-maps}, a python-based graphing library \textemdash~ as the pipeline.

%Some locations were university names, for example, . which we used to identify the county. For geolocations, we want to provide an accurate view of these users' locations, providing a 1-1 relationship between the user and their location. 

%The data pipeline provided additional textual analysis through another script, \texttt{google\_scholar.py}. It uses projects' keywords to identify Google Scholar publications. Unfortunately, the script could not extract publications from Google Scholar because the parsing script \textemdash~last modified in February 2017 \textemdash~had issues with the output, resulting in our inability to report Google Scholar findings. The paper by Shen and Spruit \cite{shen:2019} did not report on the Google Scholar results, and it is uncertain whether lack of reporting might be due to the issues parsing the Google Scholar output.

%This file is required before proceeding to the analysis portion on the pipeline. The pipeline uses a quantitative approach to identify existing repositories over the last 10 years and their attributes. These methods produced top owners, development trends, topics, and common programming languages.

%\subsection{Pipeline Data Analysis} \label{subsection_data_collection}

%The pipeline also uses the keywords to find Google Scholar\footnote{https://scholar.google.com} publications related to the projects. The pipeline's \texttt{google\_scholar.py} script incorporates another script\footnote{https://github.com/ckreibich/scholar.py} to parse output from Google Scholar to identify publications and to save in a separate CSV file.

%The data pipeline also provides visualisations to model the data, such as a linear regression model that predicts ``the number of stars of a repository based on several predictors: Forks, the number of issues, the repository size, owner type, the size of the \texttt{README} files, the total number of commits, and creation year'' \cite[p.~5]{shen:2019}. The pipeline's \texttt{data\_analysis.py} script generates a visualisation to present the geolocations of the project owners using Plotly's world choropleth map\footnote{https://plotly.com/python/choropleth-maps}, a python-based graphing library.

%Prior to process the repositories through the analysis portion of the pipeline (See Figure X), we examined the raw data. The examination helped the analysis process produced accurate results.


\subsection{Selection Criteria for Active Projects} \label{subsection_selection_criteria}

%For our study, we seek to identify active gender-related projects, to better understand the open-source community's interest in developing products that focus on gender topics and issues. 

We developed the selection criteria to ensure we analysed valid projects and removed biased results, such as students' homework and dormant projects. The selection criteria select active projects with recent updates, commits, and Pull Requests. We applied recommendations by Kalliamvakou et al. \cite{kalliamvakou:2014} to construct the selection criteria considering nine perils to avoid biased results in findings. Table \ref{tbl:qual_selection_criteria} shows the four perils we used and how we applied them to identify active projects. We did not consider the five perils because they focus on software-based projects\textemdash~for example, \textit{Peril IV. A large portion of repositories is not for software development} \cite{kalliamvakou:2014}. These five perils may exclude projects from our research that do not require programming languages, such as those specialising in gender policy.

%, and software development processes, such as \textit{Perils VI}, \textit{VII}, and \textit{VIII} that focus on Pull Requests. We did not want to exclude projects that focus on gender policy or language. and we want to include these in our results.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We converted these perils into selection rules, shown in Table \ref{tbl:qual_selection_criteria}. For example, we addressed \textit{Peril III. Most projects are inactive} by selecting projects that demonstrate activity, such as commits, forks, and updates within six months (2021-08-01 to 2022-02-01). Six months was the duration because Kalliamvakou et al. \cite{kalliamvakou:2014} identified that 54\% of the GitHub projects were active during this period through commits and Pull Requests. We included project updates to the selection criteria because non-software projects might not use Pull Requests to make changes. The selection criteria also filtered dormant projects using a manual intervention similar to Tang et al. \cite{tang:2021} that used the keywords \textit{``deprecated''}, \textit{``no longer maintained''}, \textit{``out-of-date''}, and \textit{``unsupported''} to identify unsupported APIs in applications. In our study, we searched for the exact keywords in the projects' \textit{Description} field to exclude dormant projects. The selection process applied the selection rules in Table \ref{tbl:qual_selection_criteria} serially, which generated a CSV file with all active gender-related projects. We describe the analysis further in this section. 

%After identifying t￼ We used spreadsheets to perform median analysishe active projects, we analysed the projects using approaches described further in this section.

\subsection{Quantitative Analysis} \label{subsection_quan_analysis}

We used quantitative analysis to compare two datasets: the active gender-related projects and a baseline dataset containing a random selection of active GitHub projects. We construct the baseline dataset through random selection, a process previously used by Eaton \cite{eaton:2021} to create a baseline with GitHub users. But for our baseline, we randomly selected active projects using the selection criteria described in Section \ref{subsection_selection_criteria} and reviewed their descriptions to confirm they did not contain gender-related projects.

  \caption{Gender Social Structure Framework \cite{risman:2013}} %to Classify Active Gender-Related Projects}
  \label{fig:risman_figure}
\end{figure*}

We used exploratory analysis to compare the projects' user types, forks, and stars. We selected these attributes because they provide a view into the open-source community's involvement (user type and forks) and interest (stars) in these projects. Exploratory analysis was previously applied to GitHub data, evaluating automotive projects \cite{kochanthara:2022} and examining the behaviours of librarians on GitHub \cite{eaton:2021}. The exploratory analysis was conducted on the two datasets in Excel, performing median analysis of the projects' user types, forks, and stars. 

Confirmatory analysis was used to determine the statistical significance of the gender-related projects. Pearson's chi-squared test (${\chi}^2$) was applied to the two datasets' user types. We also used two-sample t-tests to compare differences in the projects' forks and stars within the two datasets.

Comparative analysis was applied in this study to determine and compare the application domains used in the projects within the two datasets. This analysis provides a view into how the open-source community addresses gender-related topics using GitHub. Zanartu et al. \cite{zanartu:2022} designed a categorisation tool to identify open-source projects' application domains by processing their information using machine learning and natural language processing. The tool maps the projects across five application domains classified by Hudson et al. \cite{hudson:2016}. These application domains are \textit{Application \& System Software} that represents end-user systems, \textit{Documentation}, \textit{Non-Web Libraries \& Frameworks} that support the construction of non-web-based software applications and services, \textit{Software Tools} that support engineers in the development of software applications and services, and \textit{Web Libraries \& Frameworks} that support the construction of web-based software applications and services. The categorisation tool has a command-line interface that takes the projects' names as a CSV file and produces another CSV file containing the projects' application domains. After identifying the application domains, we performed frequency analysis in the Excel spreadsheets to create a distribution of application domains in the two datasets. 

%\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
%    \item \textbf{Application \& System Software:} Providing end-user systems, such as text editors.
%    \item \textbf{Documentation:} Focusing on documentation, such as coding exemplars and training materials.
%    \item \textbf{Non-Web Libraries \& Frameworks:} Providing frameworks and libraries to construct non-web-based software applications and services.
%    \item \textbf{Software Tools:} Providing tools that support engineers in the development of software applications and services, such as compilers and integrated development environments (IDEs).
%    \item \textbf{Web Libraries \& Frameworks:} Providing frameworks and libraries for web-based software applications and services.
%\end{enumerate}

%The Python-based categorisation tool processes the two datasets by importing the projects' names from their respective CSV files. 

We also used frequency analysis to evaluate the projects' programming languages. We identified the distribution of programming languages using a spreadsheet to compare the two datasets and to determine any differences in the languages used within these datasets. We performed the Mann-Whitney U Test \cite{greasley:2008} using IBM SPSS Statistics v25 to help identify any statistical differences between the projects' programming languages between the two datasets.

%which is provided by the project owners. Pre-processing the metadata was required to accurately quantify the data. For example, we adjusted the value \textit{``Python3''} to \textit{``Python''}. After pre-processing the programming languages, 

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis} \label{subsection_qual_analysis}

Qualitative analysis was used to classify the gender-related projects twofold. Section \ref{subsub_qual_all_projects} describes the first classification process, while Section \ref{subsub_qual_gb_projects} describes the second classification of projects focusing on gender bias.

\subsubsection{Classification of All Gender-Related Projects}\label{subsub_qual_all_projects}

We classified the active gender-related projects using thematic content analysis \cite{marshall:1999}. For the initial coding framework, we used a gender-social structure framework by Risman and Davis \cite{risman:2013} to help identify the concentration of projects within society's gender structure. The framework describes the roles and norms created by society for women and men within the social structure. Figure \ref{fig:risman_figure} shows the framework's three dimensions. The \textit{Individual} dimension focuses on the progress of gender identity and how the individual socialises. The \textit{Interactional} dimension focuses on the cultural expectations for women and men and the presumptions placed on them even when performing equivalent societal roles. The \textit{Institutional} dimension examines how culture influences actions through regulations and gender-specific organisational schemas. Risman and Davis posit the framework's dimensions have a cyclic relationship,  influencing the dynamics in the social structure that can contribute to society's gender inequalities.

%on two datasets constructed by the pipeline. The first dataset is the Google Scholar results. The data pipeline produced a spreadsheet of the results, including the keywords, publication title, and associated repository. For analysis, we identified the unique publications and identified publications that were associated with gender-related keywords. We analysed the keywords for these publications to identify common these in these papers. We strengthen the classification of these by also examining a subset of the collected repositories to identify the areas of interests the OSS community has on the gender-related topics. 

The initial coding framework contained four nodes: the three gender social structure dimensions and \textit{Unrelated} to represent projects unrelated to the gender topics. The pipeline extracted the projects' informative keywords (See Section \ref{section_pipeline_design}) to classify the projects into four nodes. The qualitative process marked any active project unrelated to gender into the \textit{Unrelated} node. The primary author performed the coding process with the projects' informative keywords. For coding reliability, the authors met to discuss the framework's dimensions to agree on the coding process. The meeting helped establish the accuracy of the coding process by confirming the authors' understanding of how the projects' keywords relate to the framework's dimensions. The authors decided to group \textit{``gender detection''} and \textit{``gender prediction''} keywords and place them within the \textit{Individual} dimension because the projects use the information to identify an individual's gender. The projects were re-coded after the discussion by one author to ensure the agreed-upon coding process was accurately applied to the projects. 

Because the projects contained a variety of informative keywords with similar meanings or goals, such as \textit{``Female Gender Classifier''} and \textit{``gender classifier''}, we used NVivo, a qualitative analysis tool, to consolidate similar keywords and phrases into groups. We used these groups to classify the projects into the framework's dimensions. If projects did not have informative keywords, we evaluated the \texttt{README}s to understand their purpose. Reviewing the \texttt{README} files was performed on 18.72\% of the projects exclusively using the keyword \textit{``gender''}, a broad term that lacks details on the project's purpose. During the classification process, we excluded project keywords (9.36\%) that did not relate to gender, such as \textit{``Javascript''} and \textit{``Must-read papers''}. If all the project's keywords were not gender-related, we placed the project into the \textit{Miscellaneous} group within the \textit{Unrelated} category. For projects (n=60, 20.34\%) containing multiple keywords related to gender, we coded them into more than one dimension. For example, the Inclusive Design Toolkit \cite{ontario:2022} is a project that promotes diversity and inclusion. This project was placed in the \textit{Inclusion} and \textit{Income} groups and classified within the \textit{Institutional} and \textit{Individual} dimensions. The coding process formed a matrix we extracted from NVivo to present the findings.

%The analysis was performed with NVivo, using the keywords to place the project in the appropriate dimension. 

 

 

%If no node existed related to the purpose of the paper, a new node was created. We also assigned papers with keywords to the \textit{``None''} node, helping us to track these repositories. To code project themes, the project keywords related to gender were used to create nodes for the emerging themes. Example of excluded keywords are \textit{``real time''}, \textit{``simple machine''}, and \textit{``R code''}. Any project that did not contain keywords were assigned the \textit{None} code. Projects that contained keywords but these keywords are unrelated to gender-related topics were assigned the \textit{Unrelated} node, to denote the keywords would make it difficult for users interested in identifying gender-related projects.

%During the classification, Some of the keywords, such as \textit{``gender''} did not provide enough detail to discern the appropriate dimension in the social structure framework. To better classify these projects we examined the \textit{description} field for more project details. Some of the projects' keywords were similar, such as \textit{``gender recognition''} and \textit{``gender identification''}, which we consolidated. Other categories remained separated, such as \textit{``gender detection''} from \textit{``gender detection model''}, making a distinction between technical concepts and generalised situations. We made a distinction between gender identification and prediction as well since \textit{``gender detection''} focuses on the physical aspects related to gender, such as age and face. 

%Some of the projects' keywords were unrelated to gender, which required manual examination of the projects' contents for classification. We note the placement of these projects to denote those that required additional inspection. If the manual inspection showed the projects were still unrelated, they remained in the \textit{Unrelated} category. 

%The second qualitative analysis was performed on the the Google Scholar requests produced by the data pipeline, to determine the types of papers that were identified.

\subsubsection{Classification of Gender Bias Projects}\label{subsub_qual_gb_projects}

%was used on the gender bias projects. \citet{doughman:2021} conducted their study on how Artificial Learning (AI), NLP, and ML have all reinforced the current gender biases and stereotypes. Their aim was to develop this taxonomy to aid in identifying these biases in language, specifically with English text. With several works around NLP, they found that although these works were able to minimise the bias, there was no connection between the detection and the societal significance and underlying application. 

We conducted the second classification after the gender-related projects were classified (See Section \ref{subsub_qual_all_projects}), involving the projects from the \textit{Gender Bias} group. We extracted these projects for thematic context analysis using a taxonomy by Doughman et al. \cite{doughman:2021} designed to help identify gender biases and stereotypes in the English language. This taxonomy was formed through observations on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing, propagating and reinforcing prejudices when biased text is integrated into these systems. Table \ref{tbl:gender_bias_taxonomy_table} presents the five gender bias types in the taxonomy, along with the types' definitions. These five types are \textit{Generic Pronouns}, \textit{Semantics}, \textit{Sexism}, and \textit{Exclusionary} and \textit{Occupational Bias}. Each type contains subtypes. For example, the \textit{Sexism} type has \textit{Hostile} and \textit{Benevolent} sexism subtypes.

This classification process involved two authors to ensure coding reliability. The classification required inspecting multiple areas of the project to understand its purpose, such as source code. Using an Excel spreadsheet, the authors separately coded all the projects. After coding, the authors met to agree upon the coding criteria, which included a discussion of the discrepancies from the initial coding. The authors discussed their interpretations of the \textit{Exclusionary Bias} type and the subtypes within the \textit{Generic Pronouns} and \textit{Semantics}. The authors decided to apply \textit{Generic Pronouns} when masculine representation was assumed, while \textit{Semantics} was selected when addressing sexist stereotypes. The authors also negotiated emerging types, agreeing on the types and their labels. After the negotiation, one author re-coded all the gender bias projects using the agreed-upon coding criteria. Re-coding also included reviewing the projects' \texttt{README} files, artefacts, and any associated publications identified within the \texttt{README} files. Upon completion of the re-coding, the results were quantified in the spreadsheet.

\section{Results and Discussion} \label{section_results}

%Before presenting the findings on the active gender-related projects, we provide an overview of all the gender-related projects in the past ten years (2011-2021). This information helps answer the research questions. All the gender-related projects can provide insight into users creating these projects and the open-source community's interest over the ten-year period. 

The pipeline's \textit{gender} query string identified 10,094 gender-related GitHub projects created over the ten years (2011-2021). Figure \ref{results_new_repositories} displays these projects by creation year, showing the number of projects increasing over the subsequent years. The query results show that 2017 to 2020 had over 400 newly created projects, with 2016 (n=397) approaching this figure. A potential reason for the increased number of projects using the term \textit{gender} might be the resurgence of the MeToo movement in 2017 \cite{mendes:2018}. This social movement raises awareness about sexual violence to let survivours know they are not alone. Though the movement was initiated in 2006 by Tarana Burke \cite{datla:2020}, the Twitter \#MeToo hashtag used by actress Alyssa Milano in October 2017 might have promoted interest within the digital space. 

%Majority (95.14\%) of the repositories generated come from individual GitHub users, while the remaining 4.86\% of the repositories generated by organisations.

%We also present the projects' programming languages, shown in Figure \ref{results_programming_languages}, displaying the languages by the projects' creation year. Most (86.18\%, n=8769) of the projects provided this information in the \textit{Language} field. Figure \ref{results_programming_languages} shows the top-10 programming languages used by these projects during a ten-year period. Included in the top-10 programming languages is the \textit{Others} category, a category that collates the remaining languages, which includes ActionScript and PostScript. The figure shows \textit{Jupyter Notebook} and \textit{Python} are popular languages for these projects, whereas \textit{Jupyter Notebook} had higher adoption in the later years (2019-2011). Though Jupyter Notebook was designed as a python-based solution \cite{ipython:2022}, it can support other programming languages, such as Java \cite{barba:2019}. Therefore, we cannot discern Python was the primary programming language used in Jupyter Notebook and require additional examination of the projects' software to confirm the languages used.

%We also identified informative keywords within all the public gender-related projects, where these keywords were found in the projects' \textit{Description} field. Table \ref{results_top_ten_repositories} presents the top-10 of these keywords, along with the total number and percentage of projects applying them. The median value of informative keywords within projects' description is 1 (23814 unique keywords), even though all the gender-related projects provided information in their \textit{Description} field. The table demonstrates the keyword \textit{``gender''} being applied the most (n=5046, 49.99\%) in these projects' \textit{Description} fields. Because the data pipeline used varying fields (See Section \ref{section_pipeline_design}) to query projects for the \textit{``gender''} keyword, the remaining (n=5048, 50.01\%) projects might have applied the keyword in another field, such as name and \texttt{README} files. Most (60\%, n=6) of the top-10 keywords describe an individual, for example, \textit{gender} (n=5046, 7.97\%), \textit{age}, and \textit{user's birthday}. The remaining 40\% (n=4) of the top-10 keywords focus on projects and their components, such as \textit{dataset} and \textit{project}.

%Another representation of these keywords is an LDA model, shown in Figure \ref{results_top_ten_label_keyword} that clusters the keywords into ten topics. We note the construction of the LDA model treats keywords as distinct (case sensitive) and ignores semantically similar words, such \textit{genders} and \textit{gender}. When creating the model, we manually constructed a configuration file with six entries, \texttt{LDAConfigurationFile.csv}, to map the semantically similar keywords. Figure \ref{results_top_ten_label_keyword} shows the ten topics, which are broad terms. For example, the \textit{age} contains the keywords \textit{gender}, \textit{data}, \textit{age}, \textit{analysis}, \textit{project}, and \textit{race}, terms that do not provide details to determine the projects' goals and intentions. A study by Thung et al. \cite{thung:2012} observed that ``not all applications have sufficiently relevant tags'' \cite[p.~603]{thung:2012} which could hinder the knowledge-sharing process. Our research supports the findings by Thung et al. since most of the keywords in our study were broad descriptors for the gender domain. The broad descriptors might challenge users in finding projects of interest. Detailed descriptions could help users find projects and potentially improve the descriptive clustering observed in Figure \ref{results_top_ten_label_keyword}.

%\end{figure*}

%The majority (82.52\%, n=8330) of the owners for these gender-related projects had public profiles, allowing us to visualise their geolocations. Figure \ref{fig:geolocation_figure} shows the 2645 (26.20\%) project owners providing appropriate information to map to geolocations. The majority (41.27\%, n=3438) of the project owners did not provide their locations, and 2086 (25.04\%) of the them provided ``None'' as their location. When constructing the visualisation, 19 (0.23\%) of the owners' geolocations were removed because they contained more than one location, such as \textit{``London | New York | Hong Kong''}. We also removed 128 (1.54\%) of the owners because their locations were indeterminate, for example, they provided \textit{``Internet''}, \textit{``Planet Earth''}, and \textit{``Remote''} as their geolocation. We report the project owners reside in 84 countries (median 6 users/country). The majority (36.78\%, n=978) are from the United States, while India (16.55\%, n=440) had the second most users, followed by Germany (4.36\%, n=116), Canada (4.32\%, n=115), and United Kingdom (4.21\%, n=112). Thirteen (15.78\%) countries had one representative residing in their country. 

The selection criteria identified 235 (2.31\%) active gender-related projects from the 10,094 projects. The exclusion process removed 9661 projects with less than three forks, 160 projects without activity for six months, and 38 with zero stars. In this section, we further discuss the active gender-related projects by answering the paper’s three research questions. 

\subsection{RQ1: How do the attributes of the gender-related projects compare to other active GitHub projects?} \label{subsection_rq3}

%In this section, we compare these active projects to a baseline dataset representing a random selection of active projects on GitHub, evaluating the OSS community's interest (See Section \ref{subsub_user_type}) in the projects and the programming languages (See Section \ref{subsub_program_lang}) used in these projects.

%Five (2.12\%) of these active gender-related projects did not have keywords, which is closely aligned with keywords missing in the baseline dataset (X\%, n=X).

We compare the projects' attributes to understand how the 235 active gender-related projects align with a random selection of active GitHub projects. Figure \ref{fig:user_type_comparison} presents the comparison of the owner types. The table shows a similar composition of users creating gender-related projects and the random selection of active GitHub projects. The results show the majority (Active=82.98\%, Baseline=77.02\%) of the users are \textit{Individuals}, a term used by GitHub to differentiate projects owned by organisations and personal accounts. Our results are supported by Pearson's chi-squared test (${\chi}^2$ = 2.6064, \textit{p}-value = .106434) with a moderate effect size (\textit{p} $\leq$ 0.05) that showed no statistical differences between the datasets' user types.

%\subsubsection{Projects' Forks and Stars}

We also compared the projects' forks and stars attributes. Table \ref{tbl:p_test_comparison} shows a median value of 7 for the active gender-related projects' forks, while the median value for the baseline dataset projects is 44. Comparing the projects' stars also demonstrates similar results. There is a lower number (median=20) of stars for the active gender-related projects compared to the higher median value of 316 for the projects in the baseline dataset. The statistical significance supports these results in the forks ($t(235)_{Forks}$ = -4.05011, \textit{p} $<$ .00003) and stars ($t(235)_{Stars}$ = 9.07231, \textit{p} $<$ .00001) measured with moderate (.05) effect size. These results potentially demonstrate similar user types creating gender-related projects, but more work is required to raise awareness and interest within the open-source community about gender-related projects.

%The median for all gender-related projects' forks is 0 ($\overline{X}$=0.95), where 14.82\% (n=1508) contained more than one fork. The project with the most forks (1557 forks, 16.16\%) is a face classification project, a ``real time face detection and emotion/gender classification using fer 2013/imdb datasets with keras CNN model and openCV" \cite{arriaga:2022}. Reviewing the README for this project shows it has been depreciated and replaced with Perception for Autonomous Systems (PAZ) \cite{arriagapaz:2022}, a project that did not appear in our results because it does not directly reference gender. The median for the projects' stars is 0 ($\overline{X}$=2.85), where 23.66\% (n=2407) of the projects had one or more stars. The project with the most stars (17.84\%, n=5176) is also the face classification by Arriaga \cite{arriaga:2022}. 

\iffalse
\hspace*{-3mm}\fbox{
\begin{minipage}{.95\linewidth}

\textbf{Active Project User Types, Forks, and Stars Summary:}  The results show the projects are created in similar fashion as other active GitHub projects, similar interest by individuals and organisations. However, the open-source software community does not have similar interests to the gender-related projects as the average active projects on GitHub.

Results from the application domains provide insight into the types of projects created. Table \ref{tbl:application_domain_comparison} shows the \textit{Non-Web Libraries \& Frameworks} application domain is the most prominent (n=166, 70.64\%) within the active gender-related projects. In contrast, the random selection of GitHub projects in the baseline dataset focused on the \textit{Web Libraries \& Framework} application domain (n=94, 40.00\%). Both datasets show limited focus on the \textit{Application \& System Software} application domain, where the active gender-related projects had seven (2.98\%) and nine (3.83\%) projects in the baseline dataset. A potential reason for these findings might be that gender-related projects contain task-based scripts, such as automated gender detection. The gender problem domain might not suit the solutions presented as stand-alone applications.

Figure \ref{fig:comparison_programming_languages} compares the top-10 programming languages used by the gender-related projects and the baseline dataset. The results show Python (n=101, 45.29\%) was predominately used by the active gender-related projects, while the random selection of active GitHub projects predominately used JavaScript (n=92, 39.15\%). The Mann-Whitney U Tests (\textit{p}$<$0.05 two-tailed) show significant differences for the \textit{JavaScript}, \textit{Jupyter Notebook}, and \textit{Python} languages when comparing the two datasets. More research is required to understand the different applications of languages in gender-related projects.



%\subsubsection{Projects' Programming Languages} \label{subsub_program_lang}

%With the majority (94.89\%) of the active projects providing programming languages, 

%Of the 235 active projects, 12 (5.11\%) did not declare a programming language. 

%into two different classifications: \textit{``gender detection''} and \textit{``gender prediction''}.

\begin{minipage}{.97\linewidth}

\textbf{RQ1 Summary:}  The active gender-related projects have a similar composition of project owners as a random selection of active GitHub projects; however, the forks and stars results show lower interest by the open-source community in these gender-relate projects. When comparing the two datasets, we found differences in the programming languages used by the projects, but both have limited representation within \textit{Application \& System Software} application domain. Work is required to understand the application scenarios for gender-related projects and how to promote interest in these projects within the open-source community.

%When reporting on the data pipeline output, we report on how the information provided by the project maintainers influenced the results. Areas with limited provided data include the repositories \textit{keywords}, and \textit{programming languages}, potentially making it difficult for users to find projects appropriate for their work. Our findings echo the prior research by \cite{shen:2019} that showed lack of data provided by project maintainers in the metadata. Therefore, we encourage project maintainers to provide information metadata. Presenting the results from the data pipeline shows more accurate information can be provided with additional information manually added by project maintainers.

\subsection{RQ2: How do the active gender-related GitHub projects align within the gender social structure?} \label{subsection_rq4}

We classified 235 active projects within the gender social structure framework \cite{risman:2013}, shown in Table \ref{tbl:risman_gender_results}. The table organises the findings within the three gender social structure dimensions and an \textit{Unrelated} category in descending order. We used the projects' informative keywords for the coding process, but we also evaluated 71 (30.71\%) projects' \texttt{README} files to understand their purpose better. Within these 71 projects, 44 (18.72\%) used the keyword \textit{``gender''}, 22 projects (9.36\%) contained only keywords unrelated to gender, such as \textit{``R package''} and \textit{``Chrome extension''}, and five (2.13\%) projects required further analysis because they did not have keywords. As a result, 25 (8.47\%) projects were placed in the \textit{Unrelated} category to represent projects that could not be classified within the gender social structure. 

%The coding results produced 16 project groups within these four categories, where the projects were represented as 295 nodes. 

Table \ref{tbl:risman_gender_results} shows the coding results with 16 project groups across four categories. The table organises the groups in descending order within the categories, providing group descriptions and an exemplar project as an illustration. For example, the \textit{Gender Diversity} group resides in the \textit{Institutional} (n=32, 10.85\%) dimension and contains seven (2.37\%) projects.

%Further inspection of these projects included examining their documentation, such as \texttt{README} files.

\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

The table contains 295 nodes to represent the coded projects. Some (n=98, 41.70\%) projects included more than one keyword, demonstrating their varying interests. Sixty (20.34\%) projects with more than one keyword were classified in multiple gender dimensions. For example, the project by Van Campenhout \cite{maize:2022} provides an algorithm used in a study \cite{campenhout:2018} that examines gender homophily \textemdash~the preference a person has for interacting with others of the same gender \cite{landiado:2016} \textemdash~during the training of farmers in Uganda. The study investigates gender composition and female and male trainers' roles in acquiring knowledge from farmers. The project contained the keywords \textit{``Gender Role''} and \textit{``Gender Composition''}, placing it in the two groups with the same names and classified within the gender social structure's \textit{Interactional} and \textit{Institutional} dimensions.  

The \textit{Individual} dimension contains the most (n=219, 74.24\%) projects. The majority (n=165, 55.59\%) are concentrated within the \textit{Detectors and Predictors} group. This group focuses on the detection and prediction of an individual's gender by using a person's name or by extracting information from audio and image files. For example, FaceLib \cite{ayoubi:2022} is a Python-based library that recognises an individual's facial expressions and gender through image files. Other projects in the \textit{Individual} dimension use an individual's attributes for \textit{Gender Classification} (n=20, 6.78\%), \textit{Income} (n=3, 1.02\%), and \textit{Sexual Identity and Orientation} (n=3, 1.02\%).

The \textit{Interactional} (n=19, 6.44\%) dimension, focusing on the cultural expectations placed on women and men, contains the least number of projects. For example, some projects concentrate on \textit{Gender Bias} (n=18, 6.10\%) that analyse gender-biased language. For instance, \texttt{gender-bias} \cite{marr:2022} is a project that contains a Python-based tool designed to identify and report gender-biased language in recommendation letters for the medical professions. Also, within the \textit{Gender Bias} group, a project \cite{zhao:2022} uses its \texttt{README} to list URL links to gender-related conferences and journal publications. The \textit{Gender Role} (n=1, 0.34\%) group contains one project \cite{maize:2022} that focuses on  society's expectations of how the genders behave, communicate, and conduct themselves. This previously mentioned project supports a study \cite{campenhout:2018} that examines how gender plays a role in the knowledge acquisition of Ugandan maize farmers educated by female and male trainers. 

The \textit{Institutional} (n=32, 10.85\%) dimension projects examine how culture influences gender-specific actions that emerge from regulations and organisational schemas. These include \textit{Gender Disparity} (n=14, 4.75\%) and \textit{Gender Diversity} (n=7, 2.37\%), which examine and promote gender equity and diversity in Tech. For example, the \textit{Gender Disparity} group contains a PyLadies \cite{pyladies:2022} project for the association's website maintained by their infrastructure team. PyLadies is an association that supports women in becoming active participants in the open-source community. The final category, \textit{Unrelated} (n=25, 8.47\%), contains 25 (8.47\%) projects that did not fit into the framework. Most (n=19, 6.44\%) of these projects focus on \textit{Language}, providing users with educational games and dictionaries. For example, one project \cite{belgacem:2022} contains a French dictionary that contains pronouns and verbs with their gender.

Our results show gender-related projects that promote change and raise awareness of the gender dynamics at the \textit{Institutional} and \textit{Interactional} dimensions. However, there is a limited (n=51, 17.29\%) number of projects focusing on these dimensions. A potential reason for these results might be the methods required to instigate change in these dimensions, which includes policies to promote diversity at educational institutions \cite{timmers:2010} and interventions to mitigate gender bias during the hiring process \cite{isaac:2019}. These methods to promote change and awareness might prominently use policies and documentation, whereas institutions and organisations might use other platforms and services outside of GitHub for their services. These methods might not require software applications and services to promote and disseminate change, which may explain the smaller representation of these projects on GitHub. However, more work is necessary to draw a conclusion.

%With the classification, we notice topics in the \textit{Individual} category focusing on the detection and prediction of a person based on their physical features, such as age, gender, and facial structure. 

%During the classification process, we could not classify the projects using the term \textit{``gender''} since we could not discern the purpose of this generic term and could not contain projects that relate across the framework categories. As a result, we created an emerging topic \textit{Miscellaneous}. 

%Some (X\%, n=1) of the projects were classified under more than one term. For example, ... Table X lists the results under three categories defined in the Risman's framework \cite{risman:2013}, presenting each of the subcategories within the Risman categories.

% We differentiated between gender bias and discrimination since gender bias is concern with the cultural identity of the bias while discrimination focuses on the obstacles that promote inequality.

% We also differentiated between gender disparity and diversity since disparity focuses on the unequal treatment of women and men, while we refer to diversity as equal representation of genders in situations, such as the work environment.

% We separated sexual identity and orientation since identity reflects on how the individual thinks of themselves while orientation is able the sexual preference of the individual.

\subsection{RQ1: What are the challenges in reusing an existing data pipeline in a different domain?} \label{subsection_rq1}

Reusing an existing data pipeline required setup, which included creating a token for the GitHub REST API and two accounts for the IBM-Watson and Plotly Chart Studio APIs. Pipeline modifications were also made to the query and to save the generated files to a different directory on the local computer. 

%on the local drive. These change were made to help with the adoption process, consolidating the dynamic strings into one configuration file stored as a JSON file. Figure X shows the configuration file we used in our illustration.

The pipeline's first script, \texttt{github\_query.py}, was executed ten times, adjusting the search date for each year due to the GitHub REST API's limited quota on querying data, impeding data collection \cite{cosentino:2016}. The latest GitHub REST API documentation\footnote{https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api\#rate-limiting} explains the requests per hour vary on the user's account ranging from 5,000 (Basic Account) to 15,000 (Enterprise Cloud Account) requests per hour. The results were concatenated to a CSV file, which we then examined to remove corrupt data impacting the data analysis. Two projects contained corrupted data in their description fields, resulting in nine additional lines in the CSV file. After removing the corrupted data, the data was numerically and textually analysed.

%in two parts: numerical (Section \ref{subsub_numerical_analysis}) and textual (Section \ref{subsub_textual_analysis}). We describe the analysis process in this section, while reporting the findings in Section \ref{subsection_rq2} to answer the second research question.

%\subsubsection{Numerical Analysis} \label{subsub_numerical_analysis}

The pipeline stored the projects' numeric data as separate columns in the CSV file, shown in Table \ref{tbl:extracted_data}. The pipeline did not analyse the numeric data and required the authors to calculate the median analysis for certain fields, such as the projects' forks, stars, and programming languages. Median analysis was performed using a spreadsheet. 

%The formatting issues were found in the repositories' \textit{Description} field, where return carriages generated the additional lines. We report the results in by addressing the paper's three research questions.

\iffalse

The original data pipeline required users to execute individual scripts. In the redesign, users no longer interacted with individual scripts, but executes as a single program. Figure X shows an example of how to execute the pipeline, calling the command \texttt{msrPipeline}. With no command line interface (CLI) options provided by the user, the data pipeline executes the workflow defined by the YAML script. In addition to allowing users to customise the pipeline through YAML, we also allowed users to skip and add sections using the CLI arguments. Figure X shows these arguments.

%\subsubsection{Textual Analysis} \label{subsub_textual_analysis}

%and generates the projects' keywords. In addition to access GitHub to find the keywords and storing the CSV file as an additional column, 

Textual analysis was also performed on the collected data. The data pipeline's script, \texttt{data\_analysis.py}, provided analysis, such as a top-10 list of projects topics, clustering projects' informative keywords to create a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) visualisation. The LDA model helps realise the projects' themes. 

%ascertains topics from projects' keywords 

%The pipeline also produces a visualisation that represents the project owners' geolocations, but this feature required pre-processing of the data. Geolocations required adjustments to the locations, converting them to country codes. For example, \textit{``Berlin''}, and \textit{``University of California, Berkeley''} were converted to \texttt{``DEU''} and \texttt{``USA''}. Some project owners provided more than one location, such as \textit{``NY | Tokyo''}, which we removed to avoid misrepresentation of the number of owners in the identified projects. The country codes were aggregated in a separate CSV file to create the geolocation visualisation, which the authors generated outside the pipeline since the pipeline assumed a different data model. 

%This metadata was adjusted to select the country code for the first geolocation, to providing a one-to-one relationship of the location with its project owners.

%enerate the presentation. the collected data was adjusted to provide the correct format for the X technology [PLOTLY REF]. Any data that could not help place the project owner in the correct country location, such as location values \textit{``none''}, were removed from the report. [SPLIT COUNTRY LOCATION] The results of the geolocations is discussed in Section \ref{subsection_rq2}.

%Some locations were university names, for example, . which we used to identify the county. For geolocations, we want to provide an accurate view of these users' locations, providing a 1-1 relationship between the user and their location. 

The data pipeline provided additional textual analysis through another script, \texttt{google\_scholar.py}, which uses projects' keywords to identify Google Scholar publications. Unfortunately, the script could not extract publications from Google Scholar because the parsing script \textemdash~last modified in February 2017 \textemdash~had issues with the output, resulting in our inability to report Google Scholar findings. The paper by Shen and Spruit \cite{shen:2019} did not report on the Google Scholar results, and it is uncertain whether lack of reporting might be due to parsing issues. 

%Two (7.41\%) publications were excluded because they were unrelated to gender-related topics, such as \textit{``java''} and \textit{``prediction''}.

%Adjustments were made to the script to fix the query extraction to properly identify the papers. 

%The challenges we faced with the data pipeline is not necessary due to the reuse of an existing tool. We experienced issues due to the data flow, which includes corrupted data from the source, and overlapped and duplicated entries \cite{carretero:2017}. We also encountered additional challenges related to using data pipelines surrounding missing data files and operational errors \cite{munappy:2020}, but challenges might have been heightened due to our unfamiliarity of the pipeline. User documentation explaining the pipeline usage might help with the adoption process.

\hspace*{-3mm}\fbox{
\begin{minipage}{.95\linewidth}

\textbf{RQ1 Summary:} The data pipeline was helpful in identifying and extracting gender-related projects from GitHub and required changes to use in a different domain. For numeric analysis, manual interventions by the authors were required to report findings. For textual analysis, pre-processing the data was required for accurate reporting. A section of the pipeline reporting on Google Scholar publications could not report findings due to issues parsing data.
\end{minipage}}
\fi



%Our use of the pipeline shows inaccurate results from Google Scholar, where more data is required to accurately identify papers that relate to the Google Scholar publications. Future work on the pipeline could include the GitHub owners to determine if there relationships between the projects and publications.

%We report that we had fewer GitHub repositories focused on gender compared to the open-source clinical software on GitHub in Section \ref{section_results}. Though the original pipeline was designed to mine GitHub repositories for clinical software, we generalised a data pipeline, making it more accessible to other researchers using the data pipeline for other research fields.

\subsection{RQ2: What are the attributes for all the gender-related projects on GitHub?}\label{subsection_rq2}


This section presents all the gender-related projects identified by the data pipeline, which produced 10094 projects over a ten-year period (2011-2021), with most (n=2623, 25.99\%) created in 2021. Figure \ref{results_new_repositories} shows the year these projects were created. We calculated two growth rates for project, to understand their growth rate. We performed two calculations because of the significant decline in project creation in 2021. The first growth rate for the entire ten years (2011-2021) is 3.57\%, while the second growth rate (1475.00\%) demonstrates the growth from 2011 to 2020. Both rates demonstrate a growth in gender-related projects on GitHub, but does not explain the significant decline of projects created in 2021. When examining the active projects (See Section \ref{subsection_rq3}), our analysis shows 66.86\% of the active projects were created in 2020. A potential reason for the decline in 2021 might be due to the sustained contributions made in 2020.

%To describe all the projects, we present the project owners' geolocations (Section \ref{subsub_rq2_proj_owners}), the overall interest level by the OSS community for these projects through their forks and stars (Section \ref{subsub_rq2_forks_stars}), and the programming languages and keywords defined by the project owners (Section \ref{subsub_rq2_program_lang}).

%The data pipeline provide 78.76\% of the repositories generated from the open-source clinical software.



%\subsubsection{All Project Owners and Their Geolocations} 
%\label{subsub_rq2_proj_owners}

%When examining the owner types, 60\% (n=181) are organisations, while 40\% (n=54) are individuals.

%The data pipeline generates the top-10 owners for all the projects, where these owners contributed to 1.16\% (n=118) of the projects. The top owner (0.23\%, n=23) is from the education sector. The majority (81.87\%, n=8330) of the owners had public profiles, allowing us to visualise their geolocations. Figure \ref{fig:geolocation_figure} shows their locations for the 2659 (31.92\%) project owners providing location metadata. The results show majority (41.27\%, n=3438) of the owners did not provide their locations, where 2086 (25.04\%) of the them provided ``None''. When constructing the visualisation, 19 (0.23\%) of the geolocations were removed because they contained more than one location, such as \textit{``London | New York | Hong Kong''}. We also removed 128 (1.54\%) of the owners because their locations were indeterminate, for example, the \textit{``Internet''}, \textit{``Planet Earth''}, and \textit{``Remote''}. We report the project owners reside in 84 countries (median 6 users/country). The majority (36.78\%, n=978) are from the United States, while India (16.55\%, n=440) had the second most users, followed by Germany (4.36\%, n=116), Canada (4.32\%, n=115), and United Kingdom (4.21\%, n=112). Thirteen (15.78\%) countries had one representative residing in their country. 

%Of the 109 users provide inaccurate location data, 19 (0.23\%) provided multiple locations, such as \textit{``London | New York | Hong Kong''}, which we excluded from the reporting. 

\subsubsection{All Projects' Forks and Stars} \label{subsub_rq2_forks_stars}

We evaluated the projects' forks and stars to better understand the interest in these projects. The median for all the projects' forks is 0 ($\overline{X}$=0.95), where 14.82\% (n=1508) contained more than one fork. The project with the most forks (1557 forks, 16.16\%) is a face classification project, a ``real time face detection and emotion/gender classification using fer 2013/imdb datasets with keras CNN model and openCV" \cite{arriaga:2022}. Reviewing the README for this project shows it has been depreciated and replaced with Perception for Autonomous Systems (PAZ) \cite{arriagapaz:2022}, a project that did not appear in our results because it does not directly reference gender. The median for the projects' stars is 0 ($\overline{X}$=2.85), where 23.66\% (n=2407) of the projects had one or more stars. The project with the most stars (n=5176, 17.84\%) is also the face classification by Arriaga \cite{arriaga:2022}. 
%but PAZ, its replacement project had 269 stargazers.

%total of 9636 forks across all projects.  

%There was a total of 29019 stars across the repositories.

\begin{minipage}{.95\linewidth}

\textbf{All Projects' Forks and Stars Summary:} For all the gender-related GitHub projects there are few projects (14.82\% forks, 23.66\% stars) that shows activity and interest demonstrated through the forks and stars.

%For all the gender-related GitHub projects there are did not have onverall forks and stars common to projects used by the open-source community, indicating most are inactive or for personal use.

%The results from querying Google Scholar produced 1242 results. The data pipeline created a CSV file with 13 columns that included the papers' titles, excerpts, publication year, and associated keywords that identified the paper. When examining the contents of these 1242 results, we note they are associated with 87 (0.86\%) of the repositories, producing 27 (2.17\%) unique publications.

%We used terms defined in the repositories to categorise their areas of focus.

%, providing the information, while the remaining 13.82\% (n=1406) of the repositories left the \textit{Language} field blank.
 

%From the 10175 projects 202 (1.99\%) of the projects did not provide keywords. Without the keywords, a GitHub user might have difficulty finding the appropriate projects, a sentiment also expressed by \citet{kalliamvakou:2014} that projects ``cannot be reliably and automated identified from the project metadata'' \cite[p.~96]{kalliamvakou:2014}.

Table \ref{results_top_ten_repositories} shows the top-10 keywords provided by the project owners to describe their projects. These results are from a small (n=898, 8.83\%) number of projects containing keywords (Median 1 keyword), generating 1821 unique keywords. Table \ref{results_top_ten_repositories} shows the keyword \textit{python} being applied the most (n=171). Though this table aggregates unique keywords, the data pipeline does not combine semantically similar forms of these words, such as \textit{python} and \textit{python3}. Most (70\%) of the commonly used keywords are related to the technologies and interdisciplinary fields, such as \textit{python}, \textit{machine-learning}, and \textit{keras}, while 20\% provide broad descriptions of gender, for example, \textit{gender} and \textit{gender-class}. As a result, we cannot discern the purpose of these projects. One keyword, \textit{gender-recognition}, provides the projects' (n=55) purpose. Figure \ref{results_top_ten_label_keyword} visually shows the results of the generic terms, a similar finding to Thung et al. \cite{thung:2012} that recommends more meaningful terms to help with project comparison.

%The highest ranking topics related to motivation are \textit{gender-classification} (\#15, n=13), \textit{gender} (\#21, n=10), and \textit{gender-equality} (\#28, n=8).

%When creating the LDA model, the keywords are refined to accurately form the group mappings. The keywords are also case sensitive. For example, in the original data pipeline, the keyword \textit{patient} is analysed and replaced \textit{patients}. For the redesign, 

%The pipeline also generates a LDA model, shown in Figure \ref{results_top_ten_label_keyword}, visualising by identifying keywords in the projects' descriptions and clustering into ten topics. We note the construction of the LDA model treats these keywords as distinct (case sensitive) and ignores semantically similar words, such as \textit{genders} and \textit{gender}. To create a more accurate model, we manually constructed a configuration file to map semantically similar words. We observe the ten topics are not detailed. Project owners can provide more information in the projects' descriptions, helping to better describe the purpose of these projects and more descriptive clustering.  

%rather than changing within the pipeline. For our use, we adjusted \textit{Gender} and \textit{genders} to \textit{gender}, \textit{Age} to \textit{age}, and \textit{gender of the person} to \textit{gender of a person}. Unlike the labels generated in the clinical repositories, such as \textit{medical images analysis} and \textit{application for doctors},

\textbf{RQ2 Summary:}  When reviewing all the gender-related projects on GitHub, there is an interest in gender issues and topics, showing an overall increase of projects created for this topic, where the majority of the project owners are located in the United States and an increase of the Python programming language used within these projects. However, there is limited interest in these projects by the OSS community, as demonstrated by the low number of forks and stars for these projects.

\subsection{RQ3: What types of gender bias are actively explored within GitHub projects?} \label{subsection_rq_gender_bias}

The coding of all active gender-related projects identified 18 focusing on gender bias. Table \ref{tbl:gender_bias_taxonomy_table} shows these 18 projects classified in the gender bias taxonomy, organising the results by types followed by the emerging gender bias types identified during the coding process. The 18 projects produced 39 classification nodes, demonstrating that some projects focused on more than one gender bias type. For example, Table \ref{tbl:gender_bias_taxonomy_table} shows the \texttt{gender-bias} \cite{marr:2022} project \textemdash~a tool that examines letters of recommendation for the medical profession \textemdash~is classified under \textit{Semantics} and \textit{Occupational Bias}.

Table \ref{tbl:gender_bias_taxonomy_table} presents the coding for the gender bias taxonomy, including two emerging types, \textit{Imaging Bias} (n=2, 5.13\%) and \textit{Discrimination} (n=1, 2.57\%). These emerging types did not appear in the initial coding framework because the taxonomy focuses on gender bias in the English language. In contrast, \textit{Imaging Bias} focuses on biases during visual recognition tasks, and \textit{Discrimination} concentrates on a person's prejudicial treatment of a group based on their gender or other backgrounds, such as race. An exemplar project \cite{wang:2022A} for \textit{Imaging Bias} contains a framework that examines and mitigates various biases, including gender, within visual recognition tasks. For \textit{Discrimination}, the \texttt{gender-judicial-bias-india} project \cite{bhowmick:2022A} includes files necessary to replicate a study \cite{bhowmick:2022} evaluating the legal criminal cases in India for in-group bias. We observed the majority (n=11, 61.11\%) of the gender bias projects supporting research, such as \texttt{gender-bias-BERT} \cite{bartl:2022}, that supports a published thesis \cite{bartl:2020} that evaluates gender bias within different professional groups.

The results show the majority (n=13, 33.33\%) of the projects focused on \textit{Occupational Bias}, the stereotypical gendered language applied to societal roles. For example, \texttt{gender-bias-BERT} \cite{bartl:2022} is a project that contains a tool that evaluates the English and German languages for gender bias that exists in various professions, such as medical professions. The results show an equal number of projects (n=8, 20.51\%) within the \textit{Generic Pronouns} and \textit{Semantics} types. An exemplar \textit{Generic Pronouns} project is \texttt{gender-debias} \cite{saunders:2022}, which contains feminine and masculine German pronouns that change due to gender bias. An example of a \textit{Semantics} project is the previously mentioned \texttt{gender-bias} \cite{marr:2022} project that reports on gendered language within letters of recommendation for the medical profession.

The least applied gender bias type is \textit{Exclusionary Bias} (n=2, 5.13\%), a bias that assumes and assigns a gender to a neutral or unknown entity. For example, the \texttt{Double-Hard-Debias} \cite{wang:2022} project focuses on debiasing \textit{word embeddings}, a natural language processing (NLP) concept that analyses text through word representation.

The \textit{Imaging Bias} (n=2, 5.13\%) type contains projects considering the stereotypes and inequities that emerge from visualisation tools. However, we observe from our findings a disparity between those projects (n=2) mitigating imaging bias and (n=164) projects focusing on visual recognition through gender (See Section \ref{subsection_rq4}). Perhaps some 164 projects are considering imaging bias, but additional analysis is necessary to draw a conclusion.

\vspace{2mm}\hspace*{-4mm}\fbox{
\begin{minipage}{.97\linewidth}

\textbf{RQ3 Summary:} We were able to code most (n=15, 83.33\%) of the gender bias projects within the taxonomy. Three projects addressed gender bias behaviours within visualisation tools and discrimination. \textit{Occupational Bias} is the most common type, while \textit{Exclusionary Bias} is the least applied. Though the two emerging types contained a small (n=3, 7.70\%) number of gender bias projects, it demonstrates the open-source community is considering aspects of gender bias within social behaviours and mitigating bias within the software. 

\end{minipage}}

\section{Implications} \label{section_implications}

\textbf{To Educators:}
We encourage educators to teach the ethical implications of gender detection because our findings show a strong interest in automated methods for identifying an individual's gender. \textit{Nature Portfolio} surveyed artificial intelligence (AI) experts, collecting their opinions on facial-recognition research \cite{noorden:2020}. The results showed some experts had ethical concerns in the AI field. Teaching students the implications of unethical projects might help address these concerns. Educators can also help raise students' awareness of interactional topics, such as gender bias, to potentially get them involved in open-source projects that address these topics. This might motivate students to get involved in ethical practices, such as research labs \cite{kumar:2018} that use machine and deep learning technologies to identify hate speech. Educators can also minimise students' exposure to gender-biased software. For example, a checklist exists for K-12 programs \cite{bhargava:2002} for educators to help identify gender biases in software. The checklist can assist educators in making informed decisions on adopting more inclusive software.

%We observed from our findings  that some of the gender-related projects supporting published research. 

\textbf{To Open-Source Community:} The open-source community can increase awareness of the gender-related work being conducted in their community. One way to raise awareness is through the GitHub collections, a curated list of projects posted on GitHub that highlight the work being done in communities and industries on various topics and interests.\footnote{https://github.com/collections} Showcasing these projects as a collection could encourage more members of the open-source community to get involved in these gender-related projects.

\textbf{To Researchers:} The research community may be addressing gender-related topics outside of the GitHub platform in the \textit{Interactional} dimension. We encourage researchers to make available their work on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion on open-source platforms. The presence of this work on open-source platforms might encourage the community to create and adapt projects to address gender-related topics, especially areas with a narrow focus, like \textit{Imaging Bias}.

\section{Threats to Validity} \label{section_threats_to_validity}

There are limitations to this research. The first relates to content validity since our study's reliability depends on the projects identified by the pipeline. We cannot say that the pipeline identified all gender-related projects; however, we used the GitHub REST API to validate the collected data to strengthen the results. Another threat is data consistency. To reduce the margin of variability in the qualitative results, we applied the approaches Silverman \cite{silverman:2009} suggested to improve reliability. The approaches include constant data comparison, in which the authors discuss the coding criteria, process, and results until agreeing.

\iffalse
\subsection{Content Validity} 
The reliability of our study is dependent on the results generated from the GitHub REST API, potentially influencing our findings. In addition, the GitHub REST API cannot access private projects, which might include gender-related projects. Therefore, we cannot say for certain our findings contain all gender-related projects. However, to ensure consistency in the data collection for confirmatory analysis, we used the selection criteria for the datasets.  

%but its wide usage by the community, we consider this a small risk. Another limitation is the use of the GitHub API to mine the data. Though our research produced a small subset (n=10175) of repositories. Other researchers needing to query larger datasets might encounter connection limitations. Future work could investigate the query options, such as GitHub API and GHTorrent, that best suits the user's requirements. 

\subsection{Construct Validity} 
The data pipeline extracts informative keywords from the projects' descriptions, which are used for our textual analysis. Therefore, our analysis process relied on project owners accurately depicting their projects. The potential inaccuracies in the project descriptions might influence the categorisation of the projects within the gender social structure framework.

\subsection{Face Validity} 
For this study, we used two tools developed by other researchers: the data pipeline \cite{shen:2019} and the application domain classification system \cite{zanartu:2022}. We did not perform an audit on these tools to verify their analysis processes. However, both tools were used in prior research \cite{shen:2019, zanartu:2022}. We reviewed portions of the pipeline, such as the data extraction process, when adjusting for the gender domain, which gives us a degree of confidence that it performs as expected.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{section_conclusion}

% A section of the pipeline reporting on Google Scholar publications could not report findings due to issues parsing data.

%active gender-related GitHub projects to better understand the open-source community's efforts and interest in gender-related topics through the development of open-source projects. A

The motivation for this paper is to understand the open-source community's interest in gender-related topics by evaluating their active projects on GitHub. We used a pipeline to identify the active gender-related GitHub projects, classifying them twofold, first identifying the active projects within a gender social structure and then classifying projects within a gender bias taxonomy. The results show most gender-related projects focus on the individual, performing gender detection and recognition. We observed a limited focus on interactional topics, such as projects addressing gender bias. Within gender bias, these projects primarily focus on occupational bias, with a small representation focusing on discrimination.

%For all the gender-related projects, the results show the composition of project owners is similar to other active GitHub projects. However, the interest from the open-source community is lower for these
%For textual analysis, pre-processing the data was required for accurate reporting. Having an existing pipeline can help researchers mine projects faster and reliably, but future work can strengthen the pipeline by including selection criteria to identify active projects, integrate recommendations from the mining software repositories (MSR) community to remove biased results. 

Future research can investigate the dearth of interactional projects to understand better the limited focus on detecting gendered behaviours. As Section \ref{section_implications} mentions, the education, open-source, and research communities can raise awareness of projects focusing on interactional topics, helping promote more project development in this area. There is a possibility GitHub projects focus on interactional topics, but these projects might not specify their intentions through keywords and descriptions. Future research can perform additional queries to identify other gender-related projects and can analyse more projects in-depth to identify their purpose better.

%and potentially focus on other interactional aspects, such as interactions, communications, and cooperation between the genders. 

%providing the number of contributors to these projects, enabling them to view the interests the open-source software community has in this area.

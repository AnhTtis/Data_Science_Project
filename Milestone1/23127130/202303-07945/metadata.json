    "abstract": "Despite the fact that text-to-video (TTV) model has recently achieved\nremarkable success, there have been few approaches on TTV for its extension to\nvideo editing. Motivated by approaches on TTV models adapting from\ndiffusion-based text-to-image (TTI) models, we suggest the video editing\nframework given only a pretrained TTI model and a single <text, video> pair,\nwhich we term Edit-A-Video. The framework consists of two stages: (1) inflating\nthe 2D model into the 3D model by appending temporal modules and tuning on the\nsource video (2) inverting the source video into the noise and editing with\ntarget text prompt and attention map injection. Each stage enables the temporal\nmodeling and preservation of semantic attributes of the source video. One of\nthe key challenges for video editing include a background inconsistency\nproblem, where the regions not included for the edit suffer from undesirable\nand inconsistent temporal alterations. To mitigate this issue, we also\nintroduce a novel mask blending method, termed as sparse-causal blending (SC\nBlending). We improve previous mask blending methods to reflect the temporal\nconsistency so that the area where the editing is applied exhibits smooth\ntransition while also achieving spatio-temporal consistency of the unedited\nregions. We present extensive experimental results over various types of text\nand videos, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to\nbaselines in terms of background consistency, text alignment, and video editing\nquality.",

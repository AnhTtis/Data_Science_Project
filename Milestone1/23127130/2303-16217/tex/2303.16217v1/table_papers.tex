    \caption{{\bf Existing and upcoming scientific analyses that focus on TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxies}, in addition to this reference paper and focusing on more specific and selected topics. We give them in chronological order and include only works based on the galaxy selection proposed here. This list will be kept up to date online, for future reference. All this is in addition to analyses of MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG100 and TNG300 and to scientific publications that use TNG50 MW/M31-like systems that either adopt different selections or do not fully focus on them: a full list of scientific results based on the IllustrisTNG data can be found online.}

    \caption{Subsample of the 198 TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxies that are located within the boundaries of the high time-resolution subboxes of the TNG50 volume at $z=0$. In the subboxes, the data are stored every few million years (see Tables 4 and 5 of \citealt{Nelson.2019}), allowing time evolution analyses that require high time output cadence.}

The galaxy is assembled through a number of high-redshift mergers followed by a period of quiescent accretion after z\textbackslashtextasciitilde1 which lead to the formation of two distinct dynamical components: a spheroid and a disk. The surface brightness profile is very well approximated by the superposition of an R\textasciicircum\{1/4\} spheroid and an exponential disk. The surface brightness profile is remarkably similar to that of Sab galaxy UGC615, but the simulated galaxy rotates significantly faster and has a declining rotation curve dominated by the spheroid near the center. The decline in circular velocity is at odds with observation and results from the high concentration of the dark matter and baryonic components, as well as from the relatively high mass-to-light ratio of the stars in the simulation. The simulated galaxy lies \textbackslashtextasciitilde 1 mag off the I-band Tully-Fisher relation of late-type spirals, but seems to be in reasonable agreement with Tully-Fisher data on S0 galaxies. The angular momentum of the luminous component is an order of magnitude lower than that of late-type spirals of similar rotation speed. This reflects the dominance of the slowly-rotating, dense spheroidal component. The disk component, on the other hand, has properties rather similar to those of late-type spirals. This suggests that a different form of feedback than adopted in this simulation is required to inhibit the efficient collapse and cooling of gas at high redshift that leads to the formation of the spheroid. Reconciling the properties of disk galaxies with the early collapse and high merging rates characteristic of hierarchical scenarios such as Lambda CDM remains a challenging, yet so far elusive, proposition.}},

abstract = {{ABSTRACT Spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way’s stars have revealed spatial, chemical, and kinematical structures that encode its history. In this work, we study their origins using a cosmological zoom simulation, VINTERGATAN, of a Milky Way-mass disc galaxy. We find that in connection to the last major merger at z ∼ 1.5, cosmological accretion leads to the rapid formation of an outer, metal-poor, low-[α/Fe] gas disc around the inner, metal-rich galaxy containing the old high-[α/Fe] stars. This event leads to a bimodality in [α/Fe] over a range of [Fe/H]. A detailed analysis of how the galaxy evolves since z ∼ 1 is presented. We demonstrate the way in which inside-out growth shapes the radial surface density and metallicity profile and how radial migration preferentially relocates stars from the inner disc to the outer disc. Secular disc heating is found to give rise to increasing velocity dispersions and scale heights with stellar age, which together with disc flaring explains several trends observed in the Milky Way, including shallower radial [Fe/H] profiles above the mid-plane. We show how the galaxy formation scenario imprints non-trivial mappings between structural associations (i.e. thick and thin discs), velocity dispersions, α-enhancements, and ages of stars; e.g. the most metal-poor stars in the low-[α/Fe] sequence are found to have a scale height comparable to old high-[α/Fe] stars. Finally, we illustrate how at low spatial resolution, comparable to the thickness of the galaxy, the proposed pathway to distinct sequences in [α/Fe]–[Fe/H] cannot be captured.}},

We perform an extensive parameter study of the main subgrid processes that control how gas is converted into stars and the coupled effect of supernovae feedback. We argue that previous attempts to form disc galaxies have been unsuccessful because of the universal adoption of strong feedback combined with high star formation efficiencies. Unless extreme amounts of energy are injected into the interstellar medium during supernovae events, these star formation parameters result in bulge-dominated S0/Sa galaxies as star formation is too efficient at z∼ 3. We show that a low efficiency of star formation more closely models the subparsec physical processes, especially at high redshift. We highlight the successful formation of extended disc galaxies with scalelengths rd= 4–5 kpc, flat rotation curves and bulge-to-disc ratios of B/D ∼ 1/4. Not only do we resolve the formation of a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy, we also observe the secular evolution of the disc as it forms a pseudo-bulge. The disc properties agree well with observations and are compatible with the photometric and baryonic Tully–Fisher relations, the ΣSFR–Σgas (Kennicutt–Schmidt) relation and the observed angular momentum content of spiral galaxies. We conclude that the underlying small-scale star formation physics plays a greater role than previously considered in simulations of galaxy formation.}},

abstract = {{ABSTRACT In a purely cold dark matter (CDM) universe, the initial matter power spectrum and its subsequent gravitational growth contain no special mass- or time-scales, and so neither do the emergent population statistics of internal dark matter (DM) halo properties. Using 1.5 million haloes from three illustristng realizations of a ΛCDM universe, we show that galaxy formation physics drives non-monotonic features (‘wiggles’) into DM property statistics across six decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. We characterize these features by extracting the halo mass-dependent statistics of five DM halo properties – velocity dispersion, NFW concentration, density- and velocity-space shapes, and formation time – using kernel-localized linear regression (Kllr). Comparing precise estimates of normalizations, slopes, and covariances between realizations with and without galaxy formation, we find systematic deviations across all mass-scales, with maximum deviations of 25 per cent at the Milky Way mass of \$10\textasciicircum\{12\} \textbackslash, \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\textbackslashodot\$. The mass-dependence of the wiggles is set by the interplay between different cooling and feedback mechanisms, and we discuss its observational implications. The property covariances depend strongly on halo mass and physics treatment, but the correlations are mostly robust. Using multivariate Kllr and interpretable machine learning, we show the halo concentration and velocity-space shape are principal contributors, at different mass, to the velocity dispersion variance. Statistics of mass accretion rate and DM surface pressure energy are provided in an appendix. We publicly release halo property catalogues and kllr parameters for the TNG runs at 20 epochs up to z = 12.}},

We considered disc galaxies with present-day stellar mass M⋆ ≥ 3 × 108M⊙ and follow their evolution since first entering their host cluster. Very few stellar discs survive since falling in such dense environments, ranging from 40\% surviving to all being disrupted. Such survival rates are consistent with what reported earlier for the two more massive, Virgo-like clusters in TNG50. In absolute terms, however, the low number of present-day disc galaxies in Fornax-like clusters could be at odds with the presence of three edge-on disc galaxies in the central regions of the actual Fornax cluster, as delineated by the Fornax3D survey. When looking at the Fornax analogues from random directions and with the same selection function of Fornax3D, the probability of finding three edge-on disc galaxies in any one Fornax-like cluster in TNG50 is rather low, albeit not impossible. We also compared the stellar-population properties near the equatorial plane derived from integral-field spectroscopy for the three edge-ons in Fornax to similar line-of-sight integrated values for present-day disc galaxies in TNG50. For one of these, the very old and metal-rich stellar population of its disc cannot be matched by any the disc galaxies in TNG50, including objects in the field. We discuss possible interpretations of these findings, while pointing to future studies on passive cluster spirals as a way to further test state-of-the-art cosmological simulations.}},

Additionally these simulations yield some unique dwarfs that are the first of their kind to be simulated, e.g., an HI-rich field UFD, a late-forming UFD that has structural properties similar to Crater 2, as well as a compact dwarf satellite that has no dark matter at \$z=0\$.}},

There is little variation in the field strength between arm and interarm regions, such that, in the interarms, the field is ≲20 per cent weaker than in the arms. There is no indication of variation in magnetic field as one moves along arm or interarm after correcting for the radial variation of magnetic field. We also studied the energy densities in gaseous and ionized phases of the interstellar medium and compared to the energy density in the magnetic field. The energy density in the magnetic field was found to be similar to that of the gas within a factor of ≲2 at sub-kpc scales in the arms, and thus magnetic field plays an important role in pressure balance of the interstellar medium. Magnetic field energy density is seen to dominate over the kinetic energy density of gas in the interarm regions and outer parts of the galaxies and thereby helps in maintaining the large-scale ordered fields seen in those regions.}},

abstract = {{We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectroscopy of the nucleus of M31 obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). Spectra that include the Ca II infrared triplet (λ\textbackslashtextasciitilde=8500 Å) see only the red giant stars in the double brightness peaks P1 and P2. In contrast, spectra taken at λ\textbackslashtextasciitilde=3600-5100 Å are sensitive to the tiny blue nucleus embedded in P2, the lower surface brightness nucleus of the galaxy. P2 has a K-type spectrum, but we find that the blue nucleus has an A-type spectrum: it shows strong Balmer absorption lines. Hence, the blue nucleus is blue not because of AGN light but rather because it is dominated by hot stars. We show that the spectrum is well described by A0 giant stars, A0 dwarf stars, or a 200 Myr old, single-burst stellar population. White dwarfs, in contrast, cannot fit the blue nucleus spectrum. Given the small likelihood for stellar collisions, recent star formation appears to be the most plausible origin of the blue nucleus. In stellar population, size, and velocity dispersion, the blue nucleus is so different from P1 and P2 that we call it P3 and refer to the nucleus of M31 as triple. Because P2 and P3 have very different spectra, we can make a clean decomposition of the red and blue stars and hence measure the light distribution and kinematics of each uncontaminated by the other. The line-of-sight velocity distributions of the red stars near P2 strengthen the support for Tremaine's eccentric disk model. Their wings indicate the presence of stars with velocities of up to 1000 km s-1 on the anti-P1 side of P2. The kinematics of P3 are consistent with a circular stellar disk in Keplerian rotation around a supermassive black hole. If the P3 disk is perfectly thin, then the inclination angle i\textbackslashtextasciitilde=55deg is identical within the errors to the inclination of the eccentric disk models for P1+P2 by Peiris \& Tremaine and by Salow \& Statler. Both disks rotate in the same sense and are almost coplanar. The observed velocity dispersion of P3 is largely caused by blurred rotation and has a maximum value of σ=1183+/-201 km s-1. This is much larger than the dispersion σ\textbackslashtextasciitilde=250 km s-1 of the red stars along the same line of sight and is the largest integrated velocity dispersion observed in any galaxy. The rotation curve of P3 is symmetric around its center. It reaches an observed velocity of V=618+/-81 km s-1 at radius 0.05"=0.19 pc, where the observed velocity dispersion is σ=674+/-95 km s-1. The corresponding circular rotation velocity at this radius is \textbackslashtextasciitilde1700 km s-1. We therefore confirm earlier suggestions that the central dark object interpreted as a supermassive black hole is located in P3. Thin-disk and Schwarzschild models with intrinsic axial ratios b/a<\textbackslashtextasciitilde0.26 corresponding to inclinations between 55° and 58° match the P3 observations very well. Among these models, the best fit and the lowest black hole mass are obtained for a thin-disk model with M•=1.4×108 Msolar. Allowing P3 to have some intrinsic thickness and considering possible systematic errors, the 1 σ confidence range becomes (1.1-2.3)×108 Msolar. The black hole mass determined from P3 is independent of but consistent with Peiris \& Tremaine's mass estimate based on the eccentric disk model for P1+P2. It is \textbackslashtextasciitilde2 times larger than the prediction by the correlation between M• and bulge velocity dispersion σbulge. Taken together with other reliable black hole mass determinations in nearby galaxies, notably the Milky Way and M32, this strengthens the evidence that the M•-σbulge relation has significant intrinsic scatter, at least at low black hole masses. We show that any dark star cluster alternative to a black hole must have a half-mass radius <\textbackslashtextasciitilde0.03"=0.11 pc in order to match the observations. Based on this, M31 becomes the third galaxy (after NGC 4258 and our Galaxy) in which clusters of brown dwarf stars or dead stars can be excluded on astrophysical grounds.}},

The angular resolutions are 2.́ 5 (=5.4 kpc) and 4.́ 4 (=9.5 kpc), respectively. We use these data to study various emission components in M 101 and properties of the magnetic field. Separation of thermal and non-thermal emission shows that the thermal emission is closely correlated with the spiral arms, while the non-thermal emission is more smoothly distributed indicating diffusion of cosmic ray electrons away from their places of origin. The radial distribution of both emissions has a break near R = 16 kpc (=7.́ 4), where it steepens to an exponential scale length of L ≃ 5 kpc, which is about 2.5 times smaller than at R< 16 kpc. The distribution of the polarized emission has a broad maximum near R = 12 kpc and beyond R = 16 kpc also decreases with L ≃ 5 kpc. It seems that near R = 16 kpc a major change in the structure of M 101 takes place, which also affects the distributions of the strength of the random and ordered magnetic field. Beyond R = 16 kpc the radial scale length of both fields is about 20 kpc, which implies that they decrease to about 0.3 μG at R = 70 kpc, which is the largest optical extent. The equipartition strength of the total field ranges from nearly 10 μG at R< 2 kpc to 4 μG at R = 22−24 kpc. As the random field dominates in M 101 (Bran/Bord ≃ 2.4), wavelength-independent polarization is the main polarization mechanism. We show that energetic events causing H i shells of mean diameter < 625 pc could partly be responsible for this. At radii < 24 kpc, the random magnetic field depends on the star formation rate/area, ΣSFR, with a power-law exponent of b = 0.28 ± 0.02. The ordered magnetic field is generally aligned with the spiral arms with pitch angles that are about 8° larger than those of H i filaments.}},

At z = 0, stars with t form < 2 Gyr mainly occupy the stellar spheroid, with the oldest (earliest forming) stars having more centrally concentrated profiles. The younger age cohorts populate disks of progressively longer radial scale lengths and shorter vertical scale heights. At a given radius, the vertical density profiles and velocity dispersions of stars vary smoothly as a function of age, and the superposition of old, vertically extended and young, vertically compact cohorts gives rise to a double-exponential profile like that observed in the MW. Turning to formation history, we find that the trends of spatial structure and kinematics with stellar age are largely imprinted at birth, or immediately thereafter. Stars that form during the active merger phase at z > 3 are quickly scattered into rounded, kinematically hot configurations. The oldest disk cohorts form in structures that are radially compact and relatively thick, while subsequent cohorts form in progressively larger, thinner, colder configurations from gas with increasing levels of rotational support. The disk thus forms "inside out" in a radial sense and "upside down" in a vertical sense. Secular heating and radial migration influence the final state of each age cohort, but the changes they produce are small compared to the trends established at formation. The predicted correlations of stellar age with spatial and kinematic structure are in good qualitative agreement with the correlations observed for mono-abundance stellar populations in the MW.}},

abstract = {{Our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is a benchmark for understanding disk galaxies. It is the only galaxy whose formation history can be studied using the full distribution of stars from white dwarfs to supergiants. The oldest components provide us with unique insight into how galaxies form and evolve over billions of years. The Galaxy is a luminous (L-star) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties, it falls in the sparsely populated "green valley" region of the galaxy colour-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated, structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to uncertainties as well as directions for future progress. Galactic studies will continue to play a fundamental role far into the future because there are measurements that can only be made in the near field and much of contemporary astrophysics depends on such observations.

However, connecting the Galaxy to the wider galaxy population remains difficult, due to the challenges posed by our internal perspective and to the different observational techniques employed. Here, we present a sample of galaxies identified as Milky Way analogues on the basis of their stellar masses and bulge-to-total ratios, observed as part of the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey. We analyse the galaxies in terms of their stellar kinematics and populations as well as their ionized gas contents. We find our sample to contain generally young stellar populations in their outskirts. However, we find a wide range of stellar ages in their central regions, and we detect central active galactic nucleus-like or composite-like activity in roughly half of the sample galaxies, with the other half consisting of galaxies with central star-forming emission or emission consistent with old stars. We measure gradients in gas metallicity and stellar metallicity that are generally flatter in physical units than those measured for the Milky Way; however, we find far better agreement with the Milky Way when scaling gradients by galaxies’ disc scale lengths. From this, we argue much of the discrepancy in metallicity gradients to be due to the relative compactness of the Milky Way, with differences in observing perspective also likely to be a factor.}},

This position also complicates comparisons between the Milky Way and external galaxies, due to our inability to observe the Milky Way from an external point of view. Milky Way analogue galaxies offer us a chance to bridge this divide by providing the external perspective that we otherwise lack. However, overprecise definitions of ‘analogue’ yield little-to-no galaxies, so it is vital to understand which selection criteria produce the most meaningful analogue samples. To address this, we compare the properties of complementary samples of Milky Way analogues selected using different criteria. We find the Milky Way to be within 1σ of its analogues in terms of star formation rate and bulge-to-total ratio in most cases, but we find larger offsets between the Milky Way and its analogues in terms of disc scale length; this suggests that scale length must be included in analogue selections in addition to other criteria if the most accurate analogues are to be selected. We also apply our methodology to the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy. We find analogues selected on the basis of strong morphological features to display much higher star formation rates than Andromeda, and we also find analogues selected on Andromeda’s star formation rate to overpredict Andromeda’s bulge extent. This suggests both structure and star formation rate should be considered when selecting the most stringent Andromeda analogues.}},

Three different origins of stars comprise galactic centres: (1) in situ (born in the centre), (2) migrated (born elsewhere in the galaxy and ultimately moved to the centre), (3) ex situ (accreted from other galaxies). In situ and migrated stars dominate the central stellar mass budget on average with 73 and 23 per cent, respectively. The ex situ fraction rises above 1 per cent for galaxies \$\textbackslashgtrsim 10\textasciicircum\{11\}\textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\$. Yet, only 9 per cent of all galaxies exhibit no ex situ stars in their centres and the scatter of ex situ mass is significant (\$4\textbackslash!-\textbackslash!6\textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{dex\}\$). Migrated stars predominantly originate closely from the centre (\$1\textbackslash!-\textbackslash!2\textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{kpc\}\$), but if they travelled together in clumps distances reach \$\textbackslashsim \textbackslash! 10\textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{kpc\}\$. Central and satellite galaxies possess similar amounts and origins of central stars. Star-forming galaxies (\$\textbackslashgtrsim 10\textasciicircum\{10\}\textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\$) have on average more ex situ mass in their centres than quenched ones. We predict readily observable stellar population and dynamical properties: (1) migrated stars are distinctly young (\$\textbackslashsim \textbackslash! 2\textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{Gyr\}\$) and rotationally supported, especially for Milky Way-mass galaxies, (2) in situ stars are most metal-rich and older than migrated stars, (3) ex situ stars are on random motion dominated orbits and typically the oldest, most metal-poor and α-enhanced population. We demonstrate that the interaction history with other galaxies leads to diverse pathways of building up galaxy centres in a Lambda cold dak matter universe. Our work highlights the necessity for cosmological context in formation scenarios of central galactic components and the potential to use galaxy centres as tracers of overall galaxy assembly.}},

We show that this result is incorrect and that it arises from the assumption that the mean azimuthal velocity of the stellar tracers is independent of Galactocentric radius at all heights. We substitute the assumption, supported by data, that the circular speed is independent of radius in the midplane. We demonstrate that the assumption of constant mean azimuthal velocity is implausible by showing that it requires the circular velocity to drop more steeply than allowed by any plausible mass model, with or without dark matter, at large heights above the midplane. Using the approximation that the circular-velocity curve is flat in the midplane, we find that the data imply a local dark matter density of 0.008 ± 0.003 M ⊙ pc-3 = 0.3 ± 0.1 GeV cm-3, fully consistent with standard estimates of this quantity. This is the most robust direct measurement of the local dark matter density to date.}},

We independently fit a parameterized MW potential and a three-integral, action-based distribution function (DF) to the phase-space data of 43 separate abundance-selected sub-populations (MAPs), accounting for the complex selection effects affecting the data. We robustly measure the total surface density within 1.1 kpc of the mid-plane to 5\% over 4.5 kpc < RGC < 9 kpc.

We measure the mass-weighted Galactic disk scale length to be Rd = 2.15 ± 0.14 kpc, in agreement with the photometrically inferred spatial distribution of stellar mass. We thereby measure dynamically the mass of the Galactic stellar disk to unprecedented accuracy: M * = 4.6 ± 0.3 + 3.0 (R 0/ kpc – 8) × 1010 M \&\#9737; and a total local surface density of \textbackslashSigma \_\{R\_0\}(Z=1.1\textbackslash,\{kpc\}) = 68\textbackslash, \{+/- \}\textbackslash, 4\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslashodot \textbackslash,\{pc\}\textasciicircum\{-2\} of which 38 ± 4 M \&\#9737; pc–2 is contributed by stars and stellar remnants.

We also constrain for the first time the radial profile of the dark halo at such small Galactocentric radii, finding that ρDM(r ≈R 0)vprop1/r α with α < 1.53 at 95\% confidence.

We survey different classes of operators in the nonrelativistic effective field theory that could arise from several relativistic benchmark models and emphasize that the Gaia velocity distribution could modify both the total number of events as well as the shape of the differential recoil spectra, the two primary observables in DD experiments. Employing the Euclideanized signal method, we investigate the effects of the Gaia distribution on reconstructing DM model parameters and identifying the correct DM model given a positive signal at future DD experiments. We find that for light DM with mass ∼10 GeV, the Gaia distribution poses an additional challenge for characterizing DM interactions with ordinary matter, which may be addressed by combining complementary DD experiments with different targets and lowering the detection threshold. Meanwhile, for heavy DM with mass above ∼30 GeV, depending on the type of DM model, there could be a (moderate) improvement in the sensitivity at future DD experiments.}},

We systematically study how advection, anisotropic diffusion, and additional Alfvén-wave cooling affect the galactic disc and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Global properties such as stellar mass and star formation rate vary little between simulations with and without various CR transport physics, whereas structural properties such as disc sizes, CGM densities, or temperatures can be strongly affected. In our simulations, CRs affect the accretion of gas on to galaxies by modifying the CGM flow structure. This alters the angular momentum distribution that manifests itself as a difference in stellar and gaseous disc size. The strength of this effect depends on the CR transport model: CR advection results in the most compact discs while the Alfvén-wave model resembles more the AURIGA model. The advection and diffusion models exhibit large (r ∼ 50 kpc) CR pressure-dominated gas haloes causing a smoother and partly cooler CGM. The additional CR pressure smoothes small-scale density peaks and compensates for the missing thermal pressure support at lower CGM temperatures. In contrast, the Alfvén-wave model is only CR pressure dominated at the disc-halo interface and only in this model the gamma-ray emission from hadronic interactions agrees with observations. In contrast to previous findings, we conclude that details of CR transport are critical for accurately predicting the impact of CR feedback on galaxy formation.}},

We introduce the NIHAO-UHD suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way (MW) mass galaxies and study stellar disc properties such as stellar mass, size, and rotation velocity which agree well with observations of the MW and local galaxies. In particular, the simulations reproduce the age-velocity dispersion relation and a multicomponent stellar disc as observed for the MW. Half of our galaxies show a double exponential vertical profile, while the others are well described by a single exponential model which we link to the disc merger history. In all cases, mono-age populations follow a single exponential whose scale height varies monotonically with stellar age and radius. The scale length decreases with stellar age while the scale height increases. The general structure of the stellar discs is already set at time of birth as a result of the inside-out and upside-down formation. Subsequent evolution modifies this structure by increasing both the scale length and height of all mono-age populations. Thus, our results put tight constraints on how much dynamical memory stellar discs can retain over cosmological time-scales. Our simulations demonstrate that it is possible to form thin galactic discs in cosmological simulations provided there are no significant stellar mergers at low redshifts. Most of the stellar mass is formed in situ with only a few per cent (\{≲\}5 per cent) brought in by merging satellites at early times. Redshift zero snapshots and halo catalogues are publicly available.}},

A distribution function (DF) for galactic satellites is constructed from EAGLE using specific angular momentum and specific energy, which are scaled so as to be independent of host halo mass. In this two-dimensional space, the orbital properties of satellite galaxies vary according to the host halo mass. The halo mass can be inferred by calculating the likelihood that the observed satellite population is drawn from this DF. Our method is robustly calibrated on mock EAGLE systems. We validate it by applying it to the completely independent suite of 30 AURIGA high-resolution simulations of MW-like galaxies: the method accurately recovers their true mass and associated uncertainties. We then apply it to 10 classical satellites of the MW with six-dimensional phase-space measurements, including updated proper motions from the Gaia satellite.

abstract = {{Although supernova (SN) explosions and stellar winds happen at very small scales, they affect the interstellar medium (ISM) at galactic scales and regulate the formation of a whole galaxy. Previous attempts of mimicking these effects in simulations of galaxy formation use very simplified assumptions. We develop a much more realistic prescription for modeling the feedback, which minimizes any ad hoc subgrid physics. We start with developing high-resolution models of the ISM and formulate the conditions required for its realistic functionality: formation of multiphase medium with hot chimneys, superbubbles, cold molecular phase, and very slow consumption of gas. We find that this can be achieved only by doing what the real universe does: formation of dense (>10 H atoms cm–3), cold (T  100 K) molecular phase, where the star formation happens, and which young stars disrup. Another important ingredient is the effect of runaway stars: massive binary stars ejected from molecular clouds when one of the companions becomes an SN. Those stars can move to 10-100 pc away from molecular clouds before exploding themselves as SNe. This greatly facilitates the feedback. Once those effects are implemented into cosmological simulations, galaxy formation proceeds more realistically. For example, we do not have the overcooling problem. The angular momentum problem (resulting in a too massive bulge) is also reduced substantially: the rotation curves are nearly flat. The galaxy formation also becomes more violent. Just as often observed in quasar absorption lines, there are substantial outflows from forming and active galaxies. At high redshifts we routinely find gas with few hundred km s–1 and occasionally 1000-2000 km s–1. The gas has high metallicity, which may exceed the solar metallicity. The temperature of the gas in the outflows and in chimneys can be very high: T = 107-108  K. The density profile of dark matter is still consistent with a cuspy profile. The simulations reproduce this picture only if the resolution is very high: better than 50 pc, which is 10 times better than the typical resolution in previous cosmological simulations. Our simulations of galaxy formation reach the resolution of 35 pc.}},

The spectral structure of the observations is very complex, with sometimes up to five H I components detected per spectrum, which is very rarely seen in other galaxies. New H I structures are discovered in the datacube. The most remarkable new features are an external arm and thin H I spurs in the disk outskirts. A relationship between these spurs and outer stellar clumps is evidenced. The external arm is 32 kpc long, lies on the far side of the galaxy, and has no obvious counterpart on the other side of the galaxy. Its kinematics clearly differs from the outer adjacent disk. Both these H I perturbations could result from tidal interactions with galaxy companions like NGC 205.}},

abstract = {{ABSTRACT We analyse the location of extremely metal-poor stars (EMPs; [Fe/H] < −3) in 198 Milky Way (MW)/M31-like galaxies at z = 0 in the TNG50 simulation. Each system is divided into four kinematically defined morphological stellar components based on stellar circularity and galactocentric distance, namely bulge, cold disc, warm disc, and stellar halo, in addition to satellites (with stellar mass \$\textbackslashge 5\textbackslashtimes 10\textasciicircum6\textbackslash, \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\textbackslashodot\$). According to TNG50 and across all simulated systems, the stellar halo of the main galaxy and satellites present the highest frequency of EMPs (largest MEMP, comp-to-Mtot, comp stellar mass ratio), and thus the highest chances of finding them. Such frequency is larger in lower-mass than high-mass satellites. Moreover, TNG50 predicts that the stellar halo of the main galaxy always hosts and thus contributes the majority of the EMPs of the system. Namely, it has the highest mass ratio of EMPs in it to all the EMPs in the system (largest MEMP, comp-to-MEMP(< 300kpc)). However, notably, we also find that 33 MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50 have cold discs that contribute more than 10 per cent to the total EMP mass, each with \$\textbackslashgtrsim 10\textasciicircum\{6.5-7\}\textbackslash, \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\textbackslashodot\$ of EMPs in cold circular orbits. These qualitative statements do not depend on the precise definition of EMP stars, i.e. on the adopted metallicity threshold. The results of this work provide a theoretical prediction for the location of EMP stars from both a spatial and kinematic perspective and across an unprecedented number of well-resolved MW/M31-like systems.}},

At fixed halo mass, very diverse and possibly unrealistic feedback models all predict inner shapes closer to one another than to the DMO results. Because of the large halo-to-halo variation in halo shape, a larger observational sample is required to statistically distinguish different baryonic prescriptions.}},

We focus on both the evolved (z = 0) subhalo cumulative mass functions (SHMF) and the statistics of subhaloes ever accreted, i.e. infall SHMF. We quantify the variance in subhalo abundance at fixed host mass and investigate the physical reasons responsible for such scatter. We find that in Illustris, baryonic physics impacts both the infall and z = 0 subhalo abundance by tilting the DMO function and suppressing the abundance of low-mass subhaloes. The breaking of self-similarity in the subhalo abundance at z = 0 is enhanced by the inclusion of baryonic physics. The non-monotonic alteration of the evolved subhalo abundances can be explained by the modification of the concentration-mass relation of Illustris hosts compared to Illustris-Dark. Interestingly, the baryonic implementation in Illustris does not lead to an increase in the halo-to-halo variation compared to Illustris-Dark. In both cases, the normalized intrinsic scatter today is larger for Milky Way-like haloes than for cluster-sized objects. For Milky Way-like haloes, it increases from about eight per cent at infall to about 25 per cent at the current epoch. In both runs, haloes of fixed mass formed later host more subhaloes than early formers.}},

abstract = {{This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted “base ΛCDM” in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter Ωm = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of τ = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of zre=8.8-1.4+1.7. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base ΛCDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find Neff = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value Neff = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑ mν < 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | ΩK | < 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base ΛCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r0.002< 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r0.002 < 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V(φ) ∝ φ2 potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = −1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base ΛCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base ΛCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.}},

We find an average lag between the two components of 〈Δv〉= 46.0 ± 3.9 km s−1. The velocity dispersion of the thick disc is σthick= 50.8 ± 1.9 km s−1, greater than the value of dispersion we determine for the thin disc, σthin= 35.7 ± 1.0 km s−1. The thick disc is more metal poor than the thin disc, with [Fe/H]spec=−1.0 ± 0.1 compared with [Fe/H]spec=−0.7 ± 0.05 for the thin disc. We measure a radial scalelength of the thin and thick discs of hr= 7.3 ± 1.0 and 8.0 ± 1.2 kpc, respectively. From this, we infer scaleheights for both discs of 1.1 ± 0.2 and 2.8 ± 0.6 kpc, both of which are approximately two to three times larger than those observed in the Milky Way. We estimate a mass range for the thick-disc component of 2.4 × 1010 < M*, thick < 4.1 × 1010 M⊙. This value provides a useful constraint on possible formation mechanisms, as any proposed method for forming a thick disc must be able to heat (or deposit) at least this amount of material.}},

abstract = {{We present the first results of a ground-based program to determine the proper motion of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) relative to background quasars (QSO), being carried out using the Iréneé du Pont 2.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. Eleven QSO fields have been targeted in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) over a time base of six years, and with seven epochs of observation. One quasar field was targeted in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), over a time base of five years, and with six epochs of observation. The shorter time base in the case of the LMC is compensated by the much larger amount of high-quality astrometry frames that could be secured for the LMC quasar field (124 frames), compared to the SMC fields (an average of roughly 45 frames). In this paper, we present final results for field Q0557−6713 in the LMC and field Q0036−7227 in the SMC. From field Q0557−6713, we have obtained a measured proper motion of μαcos δ = +1.95 ± 0.13 mas yr−1, μδ = +0.43 ± 0.18 mas yr−1 for the LMC. From field Q0036−7227, we have obtained a measured proper motion of μα cosδ = +0.95 ± 0.29 mas yr−1, μδ = −1.14 ± 0.18 mas yr−1 for the SMC. Although we went through the full procedure for another SMC field (QJ0036−7225), on account of unsolvable astrometric difficulties caused by blending of the QSO image, it was impossible to derive a reliable proper motion. Current model rotation curves for the plane of the LMC indicate that the rotational velocity (Vrot) at the position of LMC field Q0557−6713 can be as low as 50 km s−1, or as high as 120 km s−1. A correction for perspective and rotation effects leads to a center of mass proper motion for the LMC of μα cosδ = +1.82 ± 0.13 mas yr−1, μδ = +0.39 ± 0.15 mas yr−1 (Vrot = 50 km s−1), and to μα cosδ = +1.61 ± 0.13 mas yr−1, μδ = +0.60 ± 0.15 mas yr−1 (Vrot = 120 km s−1). Assuming that the SMC has a disk-like central structure, but that it does not rotate, we obtain a center of mass proper motion for the SMC of μα cosδ = +1.03 ± 0.29 mas yr−1, μδ = −1.09 ± 0.18 mas yr−1. Our results are in reasonable agreement with most previous determinations of the proper motion of the MCs, including recent Hubble Space Telescope measurements. Complemented with published values of the radial velocity of the centers of the LMC and SMC, we have used our proper motions to derive the galactocentric (gc) velocity components of the MCs. For the LMC, we obtain Vgc,t = +315 ± 20 km s−1, Vgc,r = +86 ± 17 km s−1 (Vrot = 50 km s−1), and Vgc,t = +280 ± 24 km s−1, Vgc,r = +94 ± 17 km s−1 (Vrot = 120 km s−1). For the SMC, we obtain Vgc,t = +258 ± 50 km s−1, Vgc,r = +20 ± 44 km s−1. These velocities imply a relative velocity between the LMC and SMC of 84 ± 50 km s−1, for Vrot,LMC = 50 km s−1, and 62 ± 63 km s−1 for Vrot,LMC = 120 km s−1. Albeit our large errors, these values are not inconsistent with the standard assumption that the MCs are gravitationally bound to each other.}},

Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation – the EAGLE reference model – by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass ≲ M⋆ (the ‘knee’ of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.}},

In this paper, we use a Bayesian approach to analyze the observed probability density function (PDF) of Bz from Zeeman surveys of H i, OH, and CN spectral lines in order to infer a density-dependent stochastic model of the total field strength B in diffuse and molecular clouds. We find that at n < 300 cm−3 (in the diffuse interstellar medium sampled by H i lines), B does not scale with density. This suggests that diffuse clouds are assembled by flows along magnetic field lines, which would increase the density but not the magnetic field strength. We further find strong evidence for B in molecular clouds being randomly distributed between very small values and a maximum that scales with volume density n as B ∝ n0.65 for n>300 cm−3, with an uncertainty at the 50\% level in the power-law exponent of about ±0.05. This break-point density could be interpreted as the average density at which parsec-scale clouds become self-gravitating. Both the uniform PDF of total field strengths and the scaling with density suggest that magnetic fields in molecular clouds are often too weak to dominate the star formation process. The stochasticity of the total field strength B implies that many fields are so weak that the mass/flux ratio in many clouds must be significantly supercritical. A two-thirds power law comes from isotropic contraction of gas too weakly magnetized for the magnetic field to affect the morphology of the collapse. On the other hand, our study does not rule out some clouds having strong magnetic fields with critical mass/flux ratios.}},

We run 25 Mpc/h and 12.5 Mpc/h volumes to z=2 with identical feedback prescriptions, the latter resolving all hydrogen-cooling halos, and the three runs display fair resolution convergence. The specific star formation rates broadly agree with data at z=0, but are underpredicted at z\textbackslashtextasciitilde2 by a factor of three, re-emphasizing a longstanding puzzle in galaxy evolution models. We compare runs using MFM and two flavours of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, and show that the GSMF is sensitive to hydrodynamics methodology at the \textbackslashtextasciitildex2 level, which is sub-dominant to choices for parameterising feedback.}},

abstract = {{ABSTRACT We use cosmological simulations of isolated Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies, as well as Local Group (LG) analogues, to define the ‘edge’ – a caustic manifested in a drop in density or radial velocity – of Galactic-sized haloes, both in dark matter and in stars. In the dark matter, we typically identify two caustics: the outermost caustic located at ∼1.4r200m, corresponding to the ‘splashback’ radius, and a second caustic located at ∼0.6r200m, which likely corresponds to the edge of the virialized material that has completed at least two pericentric passages. The splashback radius is ill defined in LG-type environments where the haloes of the two galaxies overlap. However, the second caustic is less affected by the presence of a companion, and is a more useful definition for the boundary of the MW halo. Curiously, the stellar distribution also has a clearly defined caustic, which, in most cases, coincides with the second caustic of the dark matter. This can be identified in both radial density and radial velocity profiles, and should be measurable in future observational programmes. Finally, we show that the second caustic can also be identified in the phase–space distribution of dwarf galaxies in the LG. Using the current dwarf galaxy population, we predict the edge of the MW halo to be 292 ± 61 kpc.}},

We present an improved postprocessing framework to estimate the abundance of atomic and molecular hydrogen and apply it to the IllustrisTNG simulations. We compare five different models for the atomic-to-molecular transition, including empirical, simulation-based, and theoretical prescriptions. Most of these models rely on the surface density of neutral hydrogen and the ultraviolet (UV) flux in the Lyman–Werner band as input parameters. Computing these quantities on the kiloparsec scale resolved by the simulations emerges as the main challenge. We show that the commonly used Jeans length approximation to the column density of a system can be biased and exhibits large cell-to-cell scatter. Instead, we propose to compute all surface quantities in face-on projections and perform the modeling in two dimensions. In general, the two methods agree on average, but their predictions diverge for individual galaxies and for models based on the observed midplane pressure of galaxies. We model the UV radiation from young stars by assuming a constant escape fraction and optically thin propagation throughout the galaxy. With these improvements, we find that the five models for the atomic-to-molecular transition roughly agree on average but that the details of the modeling matter for individual galaxies and the spatial distribution of molecular hydrogen. We emphasize that the estimated molecular fractions are approximate due to the significant systematic uncertainties.}},

While TNG colour distributions are clearly bimodal, this is not the case for the SFR logarithmic distributions in bins of stellar mass (SFR ≳ 10−3 M⊙yr−1).

The model predicts a quenched fraction of ∼70–90 per cent (on average) for centrals and satellites of mass ≳ 1010.5 M⊙, regardless of host mass, cosmic time (0 ≤ z ≤ 0.5), cluster-centric distance, and time since infall in the z = 0 host. Low-mass central galaxies (≲ 1010 M⊙), on the other hand, are rarely quenched unless they become members of groups (1013–14 M⊙) or clusters (≥1014 M⊙), where the quenched fraction rises to ∼ 80 per cent. Typically, the fraction of low-mass passive galaxies is higher closer to the host centre and for progressively more massive hosts. The population of low-mass satellites accreted more than ∼ 4–6 Gyr ago in massive hosts is almost entirely passive, thus suggesting an upper limit for the time needed for environmental quenching to occur. In fact, about 30 per cent of group and cluster satellites that are quenched at z = 0 were already quenched before falling into their current host, and the bulk of them quenched as early as 4–10 billion years ago. For low-mass galaxies (Mstars ≲ 1010–10.5 M⊙), this is due to pre-processing, whereby current satellites may have been members of other hosts, and hence have undergone environmental processes, before falling into their final host, this mechanism being more common and more effective for the purposes of quenching for satellites found today in more massive hosts. On the other hand, massive galaxies quench on their own and because of AGN feedback, regardless of whether they are centrals or satellites.}},

We show how measurement choices [aperture, quenched definition, and star formation rate (SFR) indicator time-scale], as well as sample selection issues (projection effects, satellite/central misclassification, and host mass distribution sampling), impact this comparison. The quenched definition produces differences of up to 70 (30) percentage points for centrals (satellites) above ∼1010.5 M⊙. At z ≳ 2, a larger aperture within which SFR is measured suppresses the quenched fractions by up to ∼50 percentage points. Proper consideration of the stellar and host mass distributions is crucial: Naive comparisons to volume-limited samples from simulations lead to misinterpretation of the quenched fractions as a function of redshift by up to 20 percentage points. Including observational uncertainties to theoretical values of Mstars and SFR changes the quenched fraction values and their trend and/or slope with mass. Taking projected rather than three-dimensional distances for satellites decreases the quenched fractions by up to 10 per cent. TNG produces quenched fractions for both centrals and satellites broadly consistent with observations and predicts up to ∼80 (90) per cent of quenched centrals at z = 0 (z = 2), in line with recent observations, and higher than other theoretical models. The quantitative agreement of TNG and Sloan Digital Sky Survey for satellite quenched fractions in groups and clusters depends strongly on the galaxy and host mass range. Our mock comparison highlights the importance of properly accounting for observational effects and biases.}},

We use auto-GMM to study the stellar kinematic structures of disk galaxies from the TNG100 run of IllustrisTNG. We identify four to five structures that are commonly present among the diverse galaxy population. Structures having strong to moderate rotation are defined as cold and warm disks, respectively. Spheroidal structures dominated by random motions are classified as bulges or stellar halos, depending on how tightly bound they are. Disky bulges are structures that have moderate rotation but compact morphology. Across all disky galaxies and accounting for the stellar mass within 3 half-mass radii, the kinematic spheroidal structures, obtained by summing up stars of bulges and halos, contribute ∼45\% of the total stellar mass, while the disky structures constitute ∼55\%. This study also provides important insights into the relationship between kinematically and morphologically derived galactic structures. Comparing the morphology of kinematic structures with that of traditional bulge+disk decomposition, we conclude that (1) the morphologically decomposed bulges are composite structures comprising a slowly rotating bulge, an inner halo, and a disky bulge; (2) kinematically disky bulges, akin to what are commonly called pseudo-bulges in observations, are compact disk-like components that have rotation similar to warm disks; (3) halos contribute almost 30\% of the surface density of the outer part of morphological disks when viewed face on; and (4) both cold and warm disks are often truncated in central regions.}},

abstract = {{Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations are increasing their level of realism by considering more physical processes and having greater resolution or larger statistics. However, usually either the statistical power of such simulations or the resolution reached within galaxies are sacrificed. Here, we introduce the NEWHORIZON project in which we simulate at high resolution a zoom-in region of ∼(16 Mpc)3 that is larger than a standard zoom-in region around a single halo and is embedded in a larger box. A resolution of up to 34 pc, which is typical of individual zoom-in, up-to-date resimulated halos, is reached within galaxies; this allows the simulation to capture the multi-phase nature of the interstellar medium and the clumpy nature of the star formation process in galaxies. In this introductory paper, we present several key fundamental properties of galaxies and their black holes, including the galaxy mass function, cosmic star formation rate, galactic metallicities, the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation, the stellar-to-halo mass relation, galaxy sizes, stellar kinematics and morphology, gas content within galaxies and its kinematics, and the black hole mass and spin properties over time. The various scaling relations are broadly reproduced by NEWHORIZON with some differences with the standard observables. Owing to its exquisite spatial resolution, NEWHORIZON captures the inefficient process of star formation in galaxies, which evolve over time from being more turbulent, gas rich, and star bursting at high redshift. These high-redshift galaxies are also more compact, and they are more elliptical and clumpier until the level of internal gas turbulence decays enough to allow for the formation of discs. The NEWHORIZON simulation gives access to a broad range of galaxy formation and evolution physics at low-to-intermediate stellar masses, which is a regime that will become accessible in the near future through surveys such as the LSST.}},

The reorientation of the spin of massive galaxies is provided by galaxy mergers, which are significant in their mass build-up. We find that the stellar mass transition from alignment to misalignment happens around 3 × 1010 M⊙. Galaxies form in the vorticity-rich neighbourhood of filaments, and migrate towards the nodes of the cosmic web as they convert their orbital angular momentum into spin. The signature of this process can be traced to the properties of galaxies, as measured relative to the cosmic web. We argue that a strong source of feedback such as active galactic nuclei is mandatory to quench in situ star formation in massive galaxies and promote various morphologies. It allows mergers to play their key role by reducing post-merger gas inflows and, therefore, keeping spins misaligned with cosmic filaments.}},

We derive the circular velocity curve with the Jeans equation assuming an axisymmetric gravitational potential. At the location of the Sun we determine the circular velocity with its formal uncertainty to be vc(R⊙ ) = (229.0+/- 0.2) km s-1 with systematic uncertainties at the ∼2\%-5\% level. We find that the velocity curve is gently but significantly declining at (-1.7 ± 0.1) km s-1 kpc-1, with a systematic uncertainty of 0.46 km s-1 kpc-1, beyond the inner 5 kpc. We exclude the inner 5 kpc from our analysis due to the presence of the Galactic bar, which strongly influences the kinematic structure and requires modeling in a nonaxisymmetric potential.

The supercluster can be broken down into cluster and strings of galaxies. It is noted that clusters are density enhancements in strings, and strings are constituent parts of superclusters. Galaxy strings constitute bridges between superclusters and join all superclusters to a single infinite network. Systems of galaxies are thus not isolated objects.

As one can only observe galaxies at one specific time in the cosmic history, this merger history remains, in principle, unobservable. By using the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project, we show that it is possible to infer the unobservable stellar assembly and merger history of central galaxies from their observable properties by using machine learning techniques. In particular, in this first paper of ERGO-ML (Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning), we choose a set of seven observable integral properties of galaxies to infer the stellar ex-situ fraction, the average merger lookback times and mass ratios, and the lookback time and stellar mass of the last major merger. To infer the posterior distribution for these parameters and hence estimate the uncertainties in the predictions, we use a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN). We find that the stellar ex-situ fraction and the time of the last major merger are well-determined by the selected set of observables, that the mass-weighted merger mass ratio is unconstrained, and that, beyond stellar mass, stellar morphology and stellar age are the most informative properties. Finally, we show that the cINN recovers the remaining unexplained scatter and secondary cross-correlations. Overall, this is a first step towards a tool that can be applied to large galaxy surveys in order to infer unobservable properties of the galaxies’ past, enabling empirical studies of galaxy evolution enriched by cosmological simulations.}},

Simple halos (32\% of the population) establish principal axes whose ordering in magnitude does not change with radius and whose orientations are almost fixed throughout the halo. Twisted halos (32\%) experience levels of gradual rotations throughout their radial profiles. Finally, stretched halos (36\%) demonstrate a stretching in the lengths of their principal axes where the ordering of different eigenvalues changes with radius. Subsequently, the halo experiences a “rotation” of ∼90° where the stretching occurs. Visualizing the 3D ellipsoid of each halo, for the first time, we report signs of a reorienting ellipsoid in twisted and stretched halos. We examine the impact of baryonic physics on DM halo shape through a comparison to dark matter only (DMO) simulations. This suggests a triaxial (prolate) halo. We analyze the impacts of substructure on DM halo shape in both hydrodynamical and DMO simulations and confirm that they are subdominant. We study the distribution of satellites in our sample. In simple and twisted halos, the angle between satellites’ angular momentum and the galaxy’s angular momentum grows with radius. However, stretched halos show a flat distribution of angles. Overlaying our theoretical outcome on the observational results presented in the literature establishes a fair agreement.}},

At fixed stellar mass, the satellite SHMR exhibits a distinct shift towards lower dynamical mass compared to the SHMR of centrals. Conversely, at fixed dynamical mass, satellite galaxies appear to have larger stellar-to-total mass fractions than centrals by up to a factor of a few. The systematic deviation from the central SHMR is larger for satellites in more massive hosts, at smaller cluster-centric distances, with earlier infall times, and that inhabits higher local density environments; moreover, it is in place already at early times (z ≲ 2). Systematic environmental effects might contribute to the perceived galaxy-to-galaxy variation in the measured SHMR when galaxies cannot be separated into satellites and centrals. The SHMR of satellites exhibits a larger scatter than centrals (by up to ∼0.8 dex), over the whole range of dynamical mass. The shift of the satellite SHMR results mostly from tidal stripping of their dark matter, which affects satellites in an outside-in fashion: The departure of the satellite SHMR from the centrals’ relation diminishes for measurements of dynamical mass in progressively smaller apertures. Finally, we provide a family of fitting functions for the SHMR predicted by IllustrisTNG.}},

The number of all satellites (subhaloes) ever accreted is larger by a factor of 4–5 (3–5) than those surviving to z = 0. Hosts with larger galaxy stellar mass, brighter K-band luminosity, more recent halo assembly, and – most significantly – larger total halo mass typically have a larger number of surviving satellites. The satellite abundances around TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxies are consistent with those of mass-matched hosts from observational surveys (e.g. SAGA) and previous simulations (e.g. Latte). While the observed MW satellite system falls within the TNG50 scatter across all stellar masses considered, M31 is slightly more satellite-rich than our 1σ scatter but well consistent with the high-mass end of the TNG50 sample. We find a handful of systems with both a Large and a Small Magellanic Cloud-like satellite. There is no missing satellites problem according to TNG50.}},

Satellites exhibit larger quenched fractions for smaller masses, at smaller distances to their host galaxy, and in the more massive M31-like compared to MW-like hosts. As satellites cross their host's virial radius, their gas content drops significantly: most satellites within 300 kpc do not contain any detectable gas reservoirs at z=0, unless they are massive like the Magellanic Clouds and M32. Nevertheless, their stellar assembly exhibits a large degree of diversity. On average, the cumulative star formation histories of satellites are more extended for brighter, more massive satellites with a later infall, and for those in less massive hosts. Based on these relationships, we can even infer infall periods for observed MW and M31 dwarfs: e.g. 0-4 Gyr ago for the Magellanic Clouds and Leo I, 4-8 and 0-2 Gyr ago for M32 and IC 10, respectively. Ram pressure stripping (in combination with tidal stripping) deprives TNG50 satellites of their gas reservoirs and ultimately quenches their star formation activity, even though only a few per cent of the present-day satellites around the 198 TNG50 MW/M31-like hosts appear as jellyfish. The typical time since quenching for currently quenched TNG50 satellites is 6.9 (+2.5)(-3.3) Gyr ago. The TNG50 results are consistent with the quenched fractions and stellar assembly of observed MW and M31 satellites, however, satellites of the SAGA survey exhibit lower quenched fractions than TNG50 and other, observed analogues.}},

We develop a new white dwarf population synthesis code that returns mock observations of the Galactic field white dwarf population for a given star formation history, while simultaneously taking into account the geometry of the Milky Way (MW), survey parameters, and selection effects. We use this model to derive the star formation histories of the thin disk, thick disk, and stellar halo. Our results show that the MW disk began forming stars (11.3 ± 0.5) Gyr ago, with a peak rate of (8.8 ± 1.4) M⊙ yr −1 at (9.8 ± 0.4) Gyr, before a slow decline to a constant rate until the present day—consistent with recent results suggesting a merging event with a satellite galaxy. Studying the residuals between the data and best-fit model shows evidence for a slight increase in star formation over the past 3 Gyr. We fit the local fraction of helium-atmosphere white dwarfs to be (21 ± 3)\%. Incorporating this methodology with data from future wide-field surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Euclid, The Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and ultraviolet Research, and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope should provide an unprecedented view into the formation of the MW at its earliest epoch through its white dwarfs.}},

Furthermore, FIREbox captures the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium in a fully cosmological setting (L=22.1 Mpc) thanks to its exceptionally high dynamic range (\textbackslashtextasciitilde10\textasciicircum6) and the inclusion of multi-channel stellar feedback. Here, we focus on validating the predictions of FIREbox by comparing to observational data. We find that, at a given stellar mass (for Mstar < 10\textasciicircum\{10.5-11\} Msun), simulated galaxies have star formation rates, atomic and molecular gas masses, gas phase and stellar metallicities in broad agreement with observations. In addition, FIREbox shows that these galaxy scaling relations extend to the low mass regime (Mstar \textbackslashtextasciitilde 10\textasciicircum7 Msun) and follow a (broken) power-law relationship. Also reproduced are the evolution of the cosmic HI density and the HI column density distribution at z\textbackslashtextasciitilde0-5. At low z, FIREbox predicts a peak in the stellar-mass--halo-mass relation, but also a higher abundance of massive galaxies and a higher cosmic star formation rate density than observed, showing that stellar feedback alone is insufficient to reproduce the properties of massive galaxies at late times. Given its high resolution and sample size, FIREbox offers a baseline prediction of galaxy formation theory in a \$\textbackslashLambda\$CDM Universe while also highlighting modeling challenges to be addressed in next generation galaxy simulations.}},

abstract = {{Aims. We test the validity of comparing simulated field disk galaxies with the empirical properties of systems situated within environments more comparable to loose groups, including the Milky Way’s Local Group. Methods. Cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies have been realised in two different environment samples: in the field and in loose groups environments with similar properties to the Local Group. Apart from the differing environments of the galaxies, the samples are kept as homogeneous as possible with equivalent ranges in last major merger time, halo mass and halo spin. Comparison of these two samples allow for systematic differences in the simulations to be identified. A kinematic decomposition is employed to objectively quantify the spheroid-to-disk ratio and to isolate the disk-star population. Metallicity gradients, disk scale lengths, colours, magnitudes and age-velocity dispersion relations are studied for each galaxy in the suite and the strength of the link between these and environment of the galaxies is studied. Results. Metallicity gradients are consistent with observations of HII regions in spiral galaxies and, in agreement with observations, correlate with total galaxy mass. The bulge-to-disk ratio of the galaxies show that these galaxies are less spheroid dominated than many other simulated galaxies in literature with the majority of both samples being disk dominated. We find that secular evolution and mergers dominate the spread of morphologies and metallicity gradients with no visible differences between the two environment samples. In contrast with this consistency in the two samples there is tentative evidence for a systematic difference in the velocity dispersion-age relations of galaxies in the different environments. Loose group galaxies appear to have more discrete steps in their velocity dispersion-age relations, if this is true it suggests that impulsive heating is more efficient in the stars of galaxies in denser environment than in the field. We conclude that at the current resolution of cosmological galaxy simulations field environment galaxies are sufficiently similar to those in loose groups to be acceptable proxies for comparison with the Milky Way provided that a similar assembly history is considered.}},

The stellar density profiles are well fitted by broken power laws, with inner slopes of ≈−3, outer slopes of ≈−4, and break radii that are typically ≈20–40 kpc. The break radii generally mark the transition between in situ formation and accretion-driven formation of the halo. The metallicity, colour, and age profiles show mild large-scale gradients, particularly when spherically averaged or viewed along the major axes. Along the minor axes, however, the profiles are nearly flat, in agreement with observations. Overall, the structural properties can be understood by two factors: that in situ stars dominate the inner regions and that they reside in a spatially flattened distribution that is aligned with the disc.

We propose and fit a global model for the Milky Way disk, specified by an inside-out star formation history, radial orbit mixing, and an empirical, parametric model for its chemical evolution. We account for the spatially complex survey selection function, and find that the model fits all data well. We find distinct inside-out growth of the Milky Way disk; the best fit model implies that the half-mass radius of the Milky Way disk has grown by 43\textbackslash\% over the last 7 Gyr. Yet, such inside-out growth still results in present-day age gradient weaker than 0.1 Gyr/kpc. Our model predicts the half-mass and half-light sizes of the Galactic disk at earlier epochs, which can be compared to the observed redshift -size relations of disk galaxies. We show that radial orbit migration can reconcile the distinct disk-size evolution with redshift, also expected from cosmological simulations, with the modest present-day age gradients seen in the Milky Way and other galaxies.}},

Yet, their formation and evolution in a cosmological context is not well understood, as cosmological simulation studies have been limited by the classic trade-off between simulation volume and resolution. Here we analyze barred disk galaxies in the cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and quantitatively compare the distributions of bar size and pattern speed to those from MaNGA observations at z = 0. TNG50 galaxies are selected to match the stellar mass and size distributions of observed galaxies, to account for observational selection effects. We find that the high resolution of TNG50 yields bars with a wide range of pattern speeds (including those with ≥ 40 km s−1 kpc−1) and a mean value of ∼ 36 km s−1 kpc larger than those from observations by only 6 km s−1 kpc−1, in contrast with previous lower-resolution cosmological simulations that produced bars that were too slow. We find, however, that the bars in TNG50 are on average ∼35\% shorter than observed, although this discrepancy may partly reflect the remaining inconsistencies in the simulation-data comparison. This leads to higher values of =Rcorot/Rb in TNG50, but points to simulated bars being too short rather than too slow. After repeating the analysis on the lower-resolution run of the same simulation (with the same physical model), we qualitatively reproduce the results obtained in previous studies: this implies that, along with physical model variations, numerical resolution effects may explain the previously found slowness of simulated bars.}},

We determine the stellar populations and star formation histories of 245 barred galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) galaxy survey, and compare them to a mass- and morphology-matched comparison sample of unbarred galaxies. At fixed stellar mass and morphology, barred galaxies are optically redder than their unbarred counterparts. From stellar population analysis using the full spectral fitting code starlight, we attribute this difference to both older and more metal-rich stellar populations. Dust attenuation however, is lower in the barred sample. The star formation histories of barred galaxies peak earlier than their non-barred counterparts, and the galaxies build up their mass at earlier times. We can detect no significant differences in the local environment of barred and unbarred galaxies in this sample, but find that the H i gas mass fraction is significantly lower in high-mass (⁠|\$\textbackslashrm \{M\}\_\{\textbackslashstar \} \textbackslashgt 10\textasciicircum\{10\}\textbackslashtextasciitilde\textbackslashrm \{M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\$|⁠) barred galaxies than their non-barred counterparts.

abstract = {{The Milky Way has been described as an anaemic spiral, but is its star formation rate (SFR) unusually low when compared to its peers? To answer this question, we define a sample of Milky Way analogues (MWAs) based on stringent cuts on the best literature estimates of non-transient structural features for the Milky Way. This selection yields only 176 galaxies from the whole of the SDSS DR7 spectroscopic sample which have morphological classifications in Galaxy Zoo 2, from which we infer SFRs from two separate indicators. The mean SFRs found are |\$\textbackslashlog (\textbackslashrm \{SFR\}\_\{SED\}/\textbackslashrm \{M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\textbackslashtextasciitilde\textbackslashrm \{yr\}\textasciicircum\{-1\})=0.53\$| with a standard deviation of 0.23 dex from SED fits, and |\$\textbackslashlog (\textbackslashrm \{SFR\}\_\{W4\}/\textbackslashrm \{M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\textbackslashtextasciitilde\textbackslashrm \{yr\}\textasciicircum\{-1\})=0.68\$| with a standard deviation of 0.41 dex from a mid-infrared calibration. The most recent estimate for the Milky Way’s SFR of |\$\textbackslashlog (\textbackslashrm \{SFR\}\_\{MW\}/\textbackslashrm \{M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\textbackslashtextasciitilde\textbackslashrm \{yr\}\textasciicircum\{-1\})=0.22\$| fits well within 2|\$\textbackslashsigma\$| of these values, where |\$\textbackslashsigma\$| is the standard deviation of each of the SFR indicator distributions. We infer that the Milky Way, while being a galaxy with a somewhat low SFR, is not unusual when compared to similar galaxies.}},

abstract = {{We have performed 2D bulge/bar/disc decompositions using g, r and i-band images of a representative sample of nearly 1000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that the Petrosian concentration index is a better proxy for the bulge-to-total ratio than the global Sérsic index. We show that pseudo-bulges can be distinguished from classical bulges as outliers in the Kormendy relation. We provide the structural parameters and distributions of stellar masses of ellipticals, classical bulges, pseudo-bulges, discs and bars, and find that 32 per cent of the total stellar mass in massive galaxies in the local universe is contained in ellipticals, 36 per cent in discs, 25 per cent in classical bulges, 3 per cent in pseudo-bulges and 4 per cent in bars. Pseudo-bulges are currently undergoing intense star formation activity and populate the blue cloud of the colour-magnitude diagram. Most (though not all) classical bulges are quiescent and populate the red sequence of the diagram. Classical bulges follow a correlation between the bulge Sérsic index and bulge-to-total ratio, while pseudo-bulges do not. In addition, for a fixed bulge-to-total ratio, pseudo-bulges are less concentrated than classical bulges. Pseudo-bulges follow a mass-size relation similar to that followed by bars, and different from that followed by classical bulges. In the fundamental plane, pseudo-bulges occupy the same locus as discs. While these results point out different formation processes for classical and pseudo-bulges, we also find a significant overlap in their properties, indicating that the different processes might happen concomitantly. Finally, classical bulges and ellipticals follow offset mass-size relations, suggesting that high-mass bulges might not be simply high-mass ellipticals surrounded by discs.}},

We compute the median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium–high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the α/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. By analysing a subsample of 44 254 high-quality spectra, we show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000-Å break strength. For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed 4000-Å break strength is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3 × 109≲M*≲ 3 × 1010 M⊙. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies. This is confirmed by the good correlation between stellar metallicity and gas-phase oxygen abundance for galaxies with both measures. The substantial range in stellar metallicity at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance suggests that gas ejection and/or accretion are important factors in galactic chemical evolution.}},

We confirm that below M* ∼ 1010.5 M⊙ satellites are older and slightly metal richer than equally massive central galaxies. In contrast, we do not detect any difference in their |\$\textbackslashrm [\textbackslashalpha /Fe]\$|⁠: |\$\textbackslashrm [\textbackslashalpha /Fe]\$| depends primarily on stellar mass and not on group hierarchy nor host halo mass. We also find that the differences in the median age and metallicity of satellites and centrals at stellar mass below |\$\textbackslashrm 10\textasciicircum\{10.5\}\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslashodot\$| are largely due to the higher fraction of passive galaxies among satellites and as a function of halo mass. We argue that the observed trends at low masses reveal the action of satellite-specific environmental effects in a ‘delayed-then-rapid’ fashion. When accounting for the varying quiescent fraction, small residual excess in age, metallicity and |\$\textbackslashrm [\textbackslashalpha /Fe]\$| emerge for satellites dominated by old stellar populations and residing in haloes more massive than 1014 M⊙, compared to equally massive central galaxies. This excess in age, metallicity, and |\$\textbackslashrm [\textbackslashalpha /Fe]\$| pertain to ancient infallers, i.e. satellites that have accreted on to the current halo more than 5 Gyr ago.

abstract = {{We exploit recent constraints on the ages and metallicities of early-type galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to gain new insight into the physical origin of two fundamental relations obeyed by these galaxies: the colour-magnitude and the Mg2-sigmaV relations. Our sample consists of 26,003 galaxies selected from the SDSS DR2 on the basis of their concentrated light profiles, for which we have previously derived median-likelihood estimates of stellar metallicity, light-weighted age and stellar mass. Our analysis provides the most unambiguous demonstration to date of the fact that both relations are primarily sequences in stellar mass and that total stellar metallicity, alpha-elements-to-iron abundance ratio and light-weighted age all increase with mass along the two relations. For high-mass ellipticals, the dispersion in age is small and consistent with the error. At the low-mass end, there is a tail towards younger ages, which dominates the scatter in colour and index strength at fixed mass. A small, but detectable, intrinsic scatter in the mass-metallicity relation also contributes to the scatter in the two observational scaling relations, even at high masses. Our results suggest that the chemical composition of an early-type galaxy is more tightly related to its dynamical mass (including stars and dark matter) than to its stellar mass. The ratio between stellar mass and dynamical mass appears to decrease from the least massive to the most massive galaxies in our sample.

Our method assumes only that the disc is locally in dynamical equilibrium, and that the 'tilt' term in the Jeans equations is small up to ˜1 kpc above the plane. We present a new calculation of the photometric distances to the K dwarf stars, and use a Monte Carlo Markov chain to marginalize over uncertainties in both the baryonic mass distribution, and the velocity and distance errors for each individual star. We perform a series of tests to demonstrate that our results are insensitive to plausible systematic errors in our distance calibration, and we show that our method recovers the correct answer from a dynamically evolved N-body simulation of the Milky Way. We find a local dark matter density of ρ dm =0.025-0.013+0.014 M⊙ pc-3 (0.95-0.49+0.53 GeV cm-3) at 90 per cent confidence assuming no correction for the non-flatness of the local rotation curve, and ρ dm =0.022-0.013+0.015 M⊙ pc-3 (0.85-0.50+0.57 GeV cm-3) if the correction is included. Our 90 per cent lower bound on ρdm is larger than the canonical value typically assumed in the literature, and is at mild tension with extrapolations from the rotation curve that assume a spherical halo. Our result can be explained by a larger normalization for the local Milky Way rotation curve, an oblate dark matter halo, a local disc of dark matter or some combination of these.}},

For this purpose, we use TNG50, a simulation of the IllustrisTNG project that combines a resolution of ∼8 × 104 M⊙ in stellar particles with a cosmological volume 52 cMpc in extent. We parametrize bulge surface brightness profiles by the Sérsic index and the bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio obtained from two-component photometric decompositions. In our sample of 287 MW/M31-like simulated galaxies, \$17.1\{\{\textbackslash \textbackslashrm per\textbackslash cent\}\}\$ of photometric bulges exhibit high-Sérsic indices and \$82.9\{\{\textbackslash \textbackslashrm per\textbackslash cent\}\}\$ show low-Sérsic indices. We study the impact that the environment, mergers and bars have in shaping the surface brightness profiles. We find no correlation between bulge properties and the environment where they reside. Simulated galaxies with higher Sérsic indices show, on average, a higher fraction of ex situ stars in their kinematically selected bulges. For this bulge population, the last significant merger (total mass ratio msat/mhost > 0.1) occurs, on average, at later times. However, a substantial fraction of low-Sérsic index bulges also experience a late significant merger. We find that bars play an important role in the development of the different types of photometric bulges. The fraction of simulated galaxies with bars is smaller for the high- than for the low-Sérsic index population, reaching differences of \$20\{\{\textbackslash \textbackslashrm per\textbackslash cent\}\}\$ at z > 1. Simulated galaxies with high fractions of ex situ stars in the bulge do not develop strong bars. Conversely, simulated galaxies with long-lived strong bars have bulges with ex situ fractions, fex situ < 0.2.}},

We reproduce observed trends wherein higher mass dwarfs quench later (if at all), regardless of environment. We also identify differences between the environments, both in terms of `satellite versus central' and `LG versus individual MW versus isolated dwarf central.' Around the individual MW-mass hosts, we recover the result expected from environmental quenching: central galaxies in the `near field' have more extended SFHs than their satellite counterparts, with the former more closely resemble isolated (true field) dwarfs (though near-field centrals are still somewhat earlier forming). However, this difference is muted in the LG-like environments, where both near-field centrals and satellites have similar SFHs, which resemble satellites of single MW-mass hosts. This distinction is strongest for M* = 106-10\textasciicircum7 \{M\}\_⊙ but exists at other masses. Our results suggest that the paired halo nature of the LG may regulate star formation in dwarf galaxies even beyond the virial radii of the MW and Andromeda.

Current probes around the Milky Way (MW) are most sensitive to such substructure within ∼20 kpc of the halo centre, where the galaxy contributes significantly to the potential. We explore the effects of baryons on subhalo populations in ΛCDM using cosmological zoom-in baryonic simulations of MW-mass haloes from the Latte simulation suite, part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. Specifically, we compare simulations of the same two haloes run using (1) DM-only (DMO), (2) full baryonic physics and (3) DM with an embedded disc potential grown to match the FIRE simulation. Relative to baryonic simulations, DMO simulations contain ∼2 × as many subhaloes within 100 kpc of the halo centre; this excess is ≳5 × within 25 kpc. At z = 0, the baryonic simulations are completely devoid of subhaloes down to 3× 10\textasciicircum6 M\_\{⊙\} within 15 kpc of the MW-mass galaxy, and fewer than 20 surviving subhaloes have orbital pericentres <20 kpc. Despite the complexities of baryonic physics, the simple addition of an embedded central disc potential to DMO simulations reproduces this subhalo depletion, including trends with radius, remarkably well. Thus, the additional tidal field from the central galaxy is the primary cause of subhalo depletion. Subhaloes on radial orbits that pass close to the central galaxy are preferentially destroyed, causing the surviving population to have tangentially biased orbits compared to DMO predictions. Our method of embedding a potential in DMO simulations provides a fast and accurate alternative to full baryonic simulations, thus enabling suites of cosmological simulations that can provide accurate and statistical predictions of substructure populations.}},

We use a Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) dark halo, an exponential disc, a Hernquist bulge, and a central black hole point mass to describe the galaxy potential. We constrain the parameters of these functions by comparing to existing surface-brightness, velocity-dispersion, and rotation-curve measurements of M31. Our description provides a good fit to the observations, and agrees well with more sophisticated modelling of M31. While in many respects the parameter set is well constrained, there is substantial uncertainty in the outer halo potential and a near-degeneracy between the disc and halo components, producing a large, nearly two-dimensional allowed region in parameter space. We limit the allowed region using theoretical expectations for the halo concentration, baryonic content, and stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/LR), finding a smaller region where the parameters are physically plausible. Our proposed mass model for M31 has Mbulge= 3.2 × 1010 M⊙, Mdisc= 7.2 × 1010 M⊙, and M200= 7.1 × 1011 M⊙, with uncorrected (for internal and foreground extinction) mass-to-light ratios of M/LR= 3.9 and 3.3 for the bulge and disc, respectively.

We define a Milky Way analog based on K-band luminosity and local environment. Here, we present satellite luminosity functions for eight Milky-Way-analog galaxies between 20 and 40 Mpc. These systems have nearly complete spectroscopic coverage of candidate satellites within the projected host virial radius down to \{r\}o< 20.75 using low-redshift gri color criteria. We have discovered a total of 25 new satellite galaxies: 14 new satellite galaxies meet our formal criteria around our complete host systems, plus 11 additional satellites in either incompletely surveyed hosts or below our formal magnitude limit. Combined with 13 previously known satellites, there are a total of 27 satellites around 8 complete Milky-Way-analog hosts. We find a wide distribution in the number of satellites per host, from 1 to 9, in the luminosity range for which there are 5 Milky Way satellites. Standard abundance matching extrapolated from higher luminosities predicts less scatter between hosts and a steeper luminosity function slope than observed. We find that the majority of satellites (26 of 27) are star-forming.

The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z = 0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z = 7 to 0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z = 4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their haloes for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star formation rates up to z = 8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z = 5 to 0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in Hubble Space Telescope mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z = 2 to their z = 0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z = 0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star formation activity and compactness.

A sample of 10 new detached, double-lined eclipsing binaries identified from the OGLE variable star catalogs and consisting of F- and G-type giant components has been analyzed. The absolute physical parameters of the individual components have been measured with a typical accuracy of better than 3\%. All but one of the systems consist of young and intermediate population stars with masses in the range of 1.4 to 3.8 M☉. This new sample has been combined with five SMC eclipsing binaries previously published by our team. Distances to the binary systems were calculated using a surface brightness—color calibration. The targets form an elongated structure, highly inclined to the plane of the sky. The distance difference between the nearest and most-distant system amounts to 10 kpc with the line-of-sight depth reaching 7 kpc. We find tentative evidence of the existence of a spherical stellar substructure (core) in the SMC coinciding with its stellar center, containing about 40\% of the young and intermediate age stars in the galaxy. The radial extension of this substructure is ∼1.5 kpc. We derive a distance to the SMC center of DSMC = 62.44 ± 0.47 (stat.) ± 0.81 (syst.) kpc corresponding to a distance modulus (m − M)SMC = 18.977 ± 0.016 ± 0.028 mag, representing an accuracy of better than 2\%.}},

We demonstrate that our simulations reproduce a wide range of present-day observables, in particular, two component disc dominated galaxies with appropriate stellar masses, sizes, rotation curves, star formation rates and metallicities. We investigate the driving mechanisms that set present-day disc sizes/scale lengths, and find that they are related to the angular momentum of halo material. We show that the largest discs are produced by quiescent mergers that inspiral into the galaxy and deposit high angular momentum material into the pre-existing disc, simultaneously increasing the spin of dark matter and gas in the halo. More violent mergers and strong AGN feedback play roles in limiting disc size by destroying pre-existing discs and by suppressing gas accretion onto the outer disc, respectively. The most important factor that leads to compact discs, however, is simply a low angular momentum for the halo. In these cases, AGN feedback plays an important role in limiting central star formation and the formation of a massive bulge.}},

We show that the properties of the central star-forming galaxy, such as the radial stellar surface density profile and star formation history, are (i) robust to stochastic variations associated with the so-called Butterfly Effect and (ii) well converged over 3.5 orders of magnitude in mass resolution. We find that there are approximately five times as many satellite galaxies at this high resolution compared to a standard (\$m\_b\textbackslashsim 10\textasciicircum\{4-5\}\textbackslash, \textbackslashrm M\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\$) resolution simulation of the same system. This is primarily because two-thirds of the high-resolution satellites do not form at standard resolution. A smaller fraction (one-sixth) of the satellites present at high-resolution form and disrupt at standard resolution; these objects are preferentially low-mass satellites on intermediate- to low-eccentricity orbits with impact parameters ≲30 kpc. As a result, the radial distribution of satellites becomes substantially more centrally concentrated at higher resolution, in better agreement with recent observations of satellites around Milky Way-mass haloes. Finally, we show that our galaxy formation model successfully forms ultra-faint galaxies and reproduces the stellar velocity dispersion, half-light radii, and V-band luminosities of observed Milky Way and Local Group dwarf galaxies across six orders of magnitude in luminosity (103–\$10\textasciicircum\{9\}\textbackslash, \textbackslashrm L\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\$).}},

The mock catalogues are made using two different methods: the public SNAPDRAGONS code, and a method based on that of Lowing et al.

These publicly available catalogues contain five-parameter astrometry, radial velocities, multiband photometry, stellar parameters, dust extinction values, and uncertainties in all these quantities. In addition, we provide the gravitational potential and information on the origin of each star. By way of demonstration, we apply the mock catalogues to analyses of the young stellar disc and the stellar halo. We show that (i) the young outer stellar disc exhibits a flared distribution that is detectable in the height and vertical velocity distribution of A- and B-dwarf stars up to radii of ˜15 kpc, and (ii) the spin of the stellar halo out to 100 kpc can be accurately measured with Gaia DR2 RR Lyrae stars. These catalogues are well suited for comparisons with observations and should help to (i) develop and test analysis methods for the Gaia DR2 data, (ii) gauge the limitations and biases of the data, and (iii) interpret the data in the light of theoretical predictions from realistic ab initio simulations of galaxy formation in the ΛCDM cosmological model.}},

We find that the bulk of the pseudobulge forms quickly at high redshift via a combination of non-axisymmetric disk instabilities and tidal interactions or mergers, both occurring on dynamical timescales, not through slow secular processes at lower redshift. Its subsequent evolution is not strictly secular either, and is closely intertwined with the evolution of the stellar bar. In fact, the structure that we recognize as a pseudobulge today evolved from a stellar bar that formed at high redshift due to tidal interactions with satellites, was destroyed by minor mergers at z \textbackslashtextasciitilde 3, re-formed shortly after, and weakened again following a steady gas inflow at z <\textbackslashtextasciitilde 1. The gradual dissolution of the bar ensued at z \textbackslashtextasciitilde 1 and continues until the present without increasing the stellar velocity dispersion in the inner regions. In this scenario, the pseudobulge is not a separate component from the inner disk in terms of formation path; rather, it is the first step in the inside-out formation of the baryonic disk, in agreement with the fact that pseudobulges of massive spiral galaxies typically have a dominant old stellar population. If our simulations do indeed reproduce the formation mechanisms of massive spirals, then the progenitors of late-type galaxies should have strong bars and small photometric pseudobulges at high redshift.}},

abstract = {{Simulations of the formation of late-type spiral galaxies in a cold dark matter (ΛCDM) universe have traditionally failed to yield realistic candidates. Here we report a new cosmological N-body/smooth particle hydrodynamic simulation of extreme dynamic range in which a close analog of a Milky Way disk galaxy arises naturally. Named "Eris," the simulation follows the assembly of a galaxy halo of mass M vir = 7.9 × 1011 M ☉ with a total of N = 18.6 million particles (gas + dark matter + stars) within the final virial radius, and a force resolution of 120 pc. It includes radiative cooling, heating from a cosmic UV field and supernova explosions (blastwave feedback), a star formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold (n SF = 5 atoms cm–3 rather than the canonical n SF = 0.1 atoms cm–3), and neglects any feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Artificial images are generated to correctly compare simulations with observations. At the present epoch, the simulated galaxy has an extended rotationally supported disk with a radial scale length Rd = 2.5 kpc, a gently falling rotation curve with circular velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths of V 2.2 = 214 km s–1, an i-band bulge-to-disk ratio B/D = 0.35, and a baryonic mass fraction within the virial radius that is 30\% below the cosmic value. The disk is thin, has a typical H I-to-stellar mass ratio, is forming stars in the region of the ΣSFR-ΣH I plane occupied by spiral galaxies, and falls on the photometric Tully-Fisher and the stellar-mass-halo-virial-mass relations. Hot (T > 3 × 105 K) X-ray luminous halo gas makes up only 26\% of the universal baryon fraction and follows a "flattened" density profile ∝r –1.13 out to r = 100 kpc. Eris appears then to be the first cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in which the galaxy structural properties, the mass budget in the various components, and the scaling relations between mass and luminosity are all consistent with a host of observational constraints. A twin simulation with a low star formation density threshold results in a galaxy with a more massive bulge and a much steeper rotation curve, as in previously published work. A high star formation threshold appears therefore key in obtaining realistic late-type galaxies, as it enables the development of an inhomogeneous interstellar medium where star formation and heating by supernovae occur in a clustered fashion. The resulting outflows at high redshifts reduce the baryonic content of galaxies and preferentially remove low-angular-momentum gas, decreasing the mass of the bulge component. Simulations of even higher resolution that follow the assembly of galaxies with different merger histories shall be used to verify our results.}},

The mass models applied consist of a single exponential stellar disc, a razor thin gas disc, and a constant dark matter density. We first consider the simplified vertical Jeans equation that ignores the tilt term and assumes a flat rotation curve. Under a Gaussian prior on the total stellar surface density, the local dark matter density inferred from Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations is \$0.0133\_\{-0.0022\}\textasciicircum\{+0.0024\}\textbackslash \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\textbackslash, \{\textbackslashrm pc\}\textasciicircum\{-3\}\$ . The local dark matter densities for subsamples in an azimuthal angle range of -10° < ϕ < 5° are consistent within their 1σ errors. However, the northern and southern subsamples show a large discrepancy due to plateaux in the northern and southern vertical velocity dispersion profiles. These plateaux may be the cause of the different estimates of the dark matter density between the north and south. Taking the tilt term into account has little effect on the parameter estimations and does not explain the north and south asymmetry. Taking half of the difference of σz profiles as unknown systematic errors, we then obtain consistent measurements for the northern and southern subsamples. We discuss the influence of the vertical data range, the scale height of the tracer population, the vertical distribution of stars, and the sample size on the uncertainty of the determination of the local dark matter density.}},

To this end, we have generated over 16 000 synthetic images of TNG50 galaxies designed to match KiDS observations, including the effects of dust attenuation and scattering, and used the statmorph code to measure various image-based morphological diagnostics in the r-band for both data sets. Such measurements include the Gini–M20 and concentration–asymmetry–smoothness statistics. Overall, we find good agreement between the optical morphologies of TNG50 and KiDS galaxies, although the former are slightly more concentrated and asymmetric than their observational counterparts. Afterwards, we trained a random forest classifier to identify merging galaxies in the simulation (including major and minor mergers) using the morphological diagnostics as the model features, along with merger statistics from the merger trees as the ground truth. We find that the asymmetry statistic exhibits the highest feature importance of all the morphological parameters considered. Thus, the performance of our algorithm is comparable to that of the more traditional method of selecting highly asymmetric galaxies. Finally, using our trained model, we estimate the galaxy merger fraction in both our synthetic and observational galaxy samples, finding in both cases that the galaxy merger fraction increases steadily as a function of stellar mass.}},

We investigate the kinematics of red clump (RC) stars in the solar neighbourhood by combining data from Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) and Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) to constrain the local dark matter density. Methods. After calibrating the absolute magnitude of RC stars, we characterized their velocity distribution over a radial distance range of 6−10 kpc and up to 1.5 kpc away from the Galactic plane. We then applied the axisymmetric Jeans equations on subsets representing the thin and thick disks to determine the (local) distribution of mass near the disk of our Galaxy. Results. Our kinematic maps are well behaved, permitting a straightforward local determination of the vertical force, which we find to be Kzthin = − 2454 ± 619Kzthin=−2454±619 (km s−1)2 kpc−1 and Kzthick = − 2141 ± 774Kzthick=−2141±774 (km s−1)2 kpc−1 at 1.5 kpc away from the Galactic plane for the thin and thick disk samples and for thin and thick disk scale heights of 0.28 kpc and 1.12 kpc, respectively.

We investigate the redshift evolution of gradients and examine relations between gradient (negative) steepness and galaxy properties. We find that TNG50 gradients are predominantly negative at all redshifts, although we observe significant diversity among these negative gradients. We determine that the gradients of all galaxies grow more negative with redshift at a roughly constant rate of approximately \$-0.02\textbackslash \textbackslashmathrm\{dex\textbackslash, kpc\textasciicircum\{-1\}\}/\textbackslashDelta z\$. This rate does not vary significantly with galaxy mass. We observe a weak negative correlation between gradient (negative) steepness and galaxy stellar mass at z < 2. However, when we normalize gradients by a characteristic radius defined by the galactic star formation distribution, we find that these normalized gradients do not vary significantly with either stellar mass or redshift. We place our results in the context of previous simulations and show that TNG50 high-redshift gradients are more negative than those of models featuring burstier feedback, which may further highlight high-redshift gradients as important discriminators of galaxy formation models. We also find that z = 0 and z = 0.5 TNG50 gradients are consistent with the gradients observed in galaxies at these redshifts, although the preference for flat gradients observed in redshift z ≳ 1 galaxies is not present in TNG50. If future JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) and ELT (Extremely Large Telescope) observations validate these flat gradients, it may indicate a need for simulation models to implement more powerful radial gas mixing within the ISM (interstellar medium), possibly via turbulence and/or stronger winds.}},

The simulations use the AREPO moving-mesh code with a set of physical models for galaxy formation based on the successful Illustris simulation, but with updated AGN and supernovae feedback models. This allows us to simultaneously reproduce the observed redshift evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function together with the stellar and gas mass fractions of local groups and clusters across a wide range of halo masses. Focusing on the properties of groups and clusters, we find very good agreement with a range of observed scaling relations, including the X-ray luminosity--total mass and gas mass relations as well as the total mass--temperature and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux--mass relations. Careful comparison of our results with scaling relations based on X-ray hydrostatic masses as opposed to weak lensing-derived masses reveals some discrepancies, which hint towards a non-negligible X-ray mass bias in observed samples. We further show that radial profiles of density, pressure and temperature of the simulated intracluster medium are in very good agreement with observations, in particular for \$r > 0.3\textbackslash r\_\{500\}\$. In the innermost regions however we find too large entropy cores, which indicates that a more sophisticated modelling of the physics of AGN feedback may be required to accurately reproduce the observed populations of cool-core and non-cool-core clusters.}},

The simulations self-consistently follow radiative cooling, star formation, metal enrichment, black hole growth and associated feedback processes from both Type II/Ia supernovae and AGN. We consider two simulation runs, one with a large comoving volume of (500 Mpc)3 and one with a smaller volume of (68 Mpc)3 but with a factor of almost 20 higher mass resolution. We compare the predicted statistical properties of AGN with results from large observational surveys. Consistently with previous results, our simulations can widely match observed black hole properties of the local Universe. Furthermore, our simulations can successfully reproduce the evolution of the bolometric AGN luminosity function for both the low-luminosity and the high-luminosity end up to z = 3.0, only at z = 1.5-2.5, the low-luminosity end is overestimated by up to 1 dex. In addition, the smaller but higher resolution run is able to match the observational data of the low bolometric luminosity end at higher redshifts z = 3-4. We also perform a direct comparison with the observed soft and hard X-ray luminosity functions of AGN, including an empirical correction for a torus-level obscuration, and find a similarly good agreement. These results nicely demonstrate that the observed `antihierarchical' trend in the AGN number density evolution (i.e. the number densities of luminous AGN peak at higher redshifts than those of faint AGN) is self-consistently predicted by our simulations. Implications of this downsizing behaviour on active black holes, their masses and Eddington ratios are discussed. Overall, the downsizing behaviour in the AGN number density as a function of redshift can be mainly attributed to the evolution of the gas density in the resolved vicinity of a (massive) black hole (which is depleted with evolving time as a consequence of star formation and AGN feedback).}},

We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media. Central (˜kpc) mass concentrations in massive (>L*) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot haloes). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion on to dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in discs. We provide all initial conditions and numerical algorithms used.}},

The images are then processed through the exact same neural network used to estimate SDSS morphologies to classify simulated galaxies in four morphological classes (E, S0/a, Sab, Scd). The CNN model classifies simulated galaxies in one of the four main classes with the same uncertainty as for observed galaxies. The mass–size relations of the simulated galaxies divided by morphological type also reproduce well the slope and the normalization of observed relations which confirms a reasonable diversity of optical morphologies in the TNG suite. However we find a weak correlation between optical morphology and Sersic index in the TNG suite as opposed to SDSS which might require further investigation. The stellar mass functions (SMFs) decomposed into different morphologies still show some discrepancies with observations especially at the high-mass end. We find an overabundance of late-type galaxies (\$\textbackslashsim 50\{\{\textbackslash \textbackslashrm per\textbackslash cent\}\}\$ versus \$\textbackslashsim 20\{\{\textbackslash \textbackslashrm per\textbackslash cent\}\}\$) at the high-mass end [log(M*/M⊙) > 11] of the SMF as compared to observations according to the CNN classifications and a lack of S0 galaxies (\$\textbackslashsim 20\{\{\textbackslash \textbackslashrm per\textbackslash cent\}\}\$ versus \$\textbackslashsim 40\{\{\textbackslash \textbackslashrm per\textbackslash cent\}\}\$) at intermediate masses.

These are traced from the time of accretion to z = 0 and compared to a control sample of central galaxies mass-matched at accretion. Most cluster discs become non-discy by z = 0, in stark contrast with the control discs, of which a significant fraction remains discy over the same timescales. Cluster discs become non-discy accompanied by gas removal and star formation quenching, loss of dark matter, and little growth or a loss of stellar mass. In contrast, control discs transform while also losing gas mass and quenching, but growing significantly in dark matter and stellar mass. Most cluster satellites change morphologies on similar timescales regardless of stellar mass, in ∼0.5-4 Gyr after accretion. Cluster discs that experienced more numerous and closer pericentric passages show the largest change in morphology. Morphological change in all cases requires the presence of a gravitational perturbation to drive stellar orbits to non-discy configurations, along with gas removal/heating to prevent replenishment of the disc through continued star formation. For cluster discs, the perturbation is impulsive tidal shocking at pericentres and not tidal stripping of outer disc stellar material, whereas for control discs, a combination of mergers and feedback from active galactic nuclei appears to be the key driving force behind morphological transformations.}},

The key factors that determine the dwarfs’ SFHs are their central/satellite status and stellar mass, with centrals and more massive dwarfs assembling their stellar mass at later times, on average, compared to satellites and lower mass dwarfs. Satellites (in hosts of mass \$M\_\{\textbackslashrm 200c, host\}=10\textasciicircum\{12-14.3\}\textbackslash, \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\$) assembled 90 per cent of their stellar mass \$\{\textbackslashsim\}7.0\_\{-5.5\}\textasciicircum\{+3.3\}\$ Gyr ago, on average and within the 10th to 90th percentiles, while the centrals did so only \$\{\textbackslashsim\}1.0\_\{-0.5\}\textasciicircum\{+4.0\}\$ Gyr ago. TNG50 predicts a large diversity in SFHs, so that individual dwarfs can have significantly different cumulative SFHs compared to the stacked median SFHs. Satellite dwarfs with the highest stellar mass to host cluster mass ratios have the latest stellar mass assembly. Conversely, satellites at fixed stellar and host halo mass found closer to the cluster centre or accreted at earlier times show significantly earlier stellar mass assembly. These trends and the shapes of the SFHs themselves are a manifestation of the varying proportions within a given subsample of quenched versus star-forming galaxies, which exhibit markedly distinct SFH shapes. Finally, satellite dwarfs in the most massive hosts have higher SFRs at early times, well before accretion into their z = 0 host, compared to a control sample of centrals mass-matched at the time of accretion. This is the result of the satellites being preprocessed in smaller hosts prior to accretion. Our findings are useful theoretical predictions for comparison to future resolved stellar population observations.}},

The currently available data sample the distance range from 100 pc to 20 kpc and cover 6500 deg2 of sky, mostly at high Galactic latitudes (|b| > 25). These stellar number density maps allow an investigation of the Galactic structure with no a priori assumptions about the functional form of its components. The data show strong evidence for a Galaxy consisting of an oblate halo, a disk component, and a number of localized overdensities. The number density distribution of stars as traced by M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (D < 2 kpc) is well fit by two exponential disks (the thin and thick disk) with scale heights and lengths, bias corrected for an assumed 35\% binary fraction, of H1 = 300 pc and L1 = 2600 pc, and H2 = 900 pc and L2 = 3600 pc, and local thick-to-thin disk density normalization ρthick(R⊙)/ρthin(R⊙) = 12\% . We use the stars near main-sequence turnoff to measure the shape of the Galactic halo. We find a strong preference for oblate halo models, with best-fit axis ratio c/a = 0.64, ρH propto r-2.8 power-law profile, and the local halo-to-thin disk normalization of 0.5\%. Based on a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the errors of derived model parameters not to be larger than \textbackslashtextasciitilde20\% for the disk scales and \textbackslashtextasciitilde10\% for the density normalization, with largest contributions to error coming from the uncertainty in calibration of the photometric parallax relation and poorly constrained binary fraction. While generally consistent with the above model, the measured density distribution shows a number of statistically significant localized deviations. In addition to known features, such as the Monoceros stream, we detect two overdensities in the thick disk region at cylindrical galactocentric radii and heights (R,Z) \textbackslashtextasciitilde (6.5,1.5) kpc and (R,Z) \textbackslashtextasciitilde (9.5,0.8) kpc and a remarkable density enhancement in the halo covering over 1000 deg2 of sky toward the constellation of Virgo, at distances of \textbackslashtextasciitilde6-20 kpc. Compared to counts in a region symmetric with respect to the l = 0° line and with the same Galactic latitude, the Virgo overdensity is responsible for a factor of 2 number density excess and may be a nearby tidal stream or a low-surface brightness dwarf galaxy merging with the Milky Way. The u - g color distribution of stars associated with it implies metallicity lower than that of thick disk stars and consistent with the halo metallicity distribution. After removal of the resolved overdensities, the remaining data are consistent with a smooth density distribution; we detect no evidence of further unresolved clumpy substructure at scales ranging from \textbackslashtextasciitilde50 pc in the disk to \textbackslashtextasciitilde1-2 kpc in the halo.}},

MBII is the highest resolution simulation of this size which includes a self-consistent model for star formation, black hole accretion and associated feedback. We provide a simulation browser web application which enables interactive search and tagging of halos, subhalos and their properties and publicly release our galaxy catalogs. Our analysis of the halo mass function (MF) in MBII reveals that baryons have strong effects, with changes in the halo abundance of 20-35\% below the knee of the MF (Mhalo < 10\textasciicircum13.2 Msun/h at z=0) when compared to fits based on dark matter only simulations. We provide a fitting function for the halo MF out to redshift z=11 and discuss how the onset of non-universality in the MF limits the accuracy of our fit. We study the halo occupation distribution and clustering of galaxies, in particular the evolution and scale dependence of stochasticity and bias finding reasonable agreement with observational data. The shape of the cosmic spectral energy distribution predicted by MBII is consistent with observations, but lower in amplitude. The Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) function is broadly consistent with observations at z>=2. At z<2, the population of passive low mass (for M*<10\textasciicircum9 Msun) galaxies in MBII makes the GSMF too steep compared to observations whereas at the high mass end (M*>10\textasciicircum11 Msun) galaxies hosting bright AGNs make significant contributions to the GSMF. The quasar bolometric luminosity function is also largely consistent with observations. We note however that more efficient AGN feedback (beyond simple thermal coupling used here) is likely necessary for the largest, rarest objects/clusters at low redshifts.}},

These processes are best studied in X-rays, and emission-line mapping is the pressing need in this area. LEM will use a large microcalorimeter array/IFU, covering a 30x30' field with 10" angular resolution, to map the soft X-ray line emission from objects that constitute galactic ecosystems. These include supernova remnants, star-forming regions, superbubbles, galactic outflows (such as the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way and their analogs in other galaxies), the Circumgalactic Medium in the Milky Way and other galaxies, and the Intergalactic Medium at the outskirts and beyond the confines of galaxies and clusters. LEM's 1-2 eV spectral resolution in the 0.2-2 keV band will make it possible to disentangle the faintest emission lines in those objects from the bright Milky Way foreground, providing groundbreaking measurements of the physics of these plasmas, from temperatures, densities, chemical composition to gas dynamics. While LEM's main focus is on galaxy formation, it will provide transformative capability for all classes of astrophysical objects, from the Earth's magnetosphere, planets and comets to the interstellar medium and X-ray binaries in nearby galaxies, AGN, and cooling gas in galaxy clusters.

Our model shows that recycled gas from stellar mass loss can provide most or all of the fuel required to sustain the current level of star formation in late-type galaxies. Stellar mass loss can therefore remove the tension between the low gas infall rates that are derived from observations and the relatively rapid star formation occurring in disk galaxies.

abstract = {{We introduce SPARC (Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves): a sample of 175 nearby galaxies with new surface photometry at 3.6 μm and high-quality rotation curves from previous H i/Hα studies. SPARC spans a broad range of morphologies (S0 to Irr), luminosities (∼5 dex), and surface brightnesses (∼4 dex). We derive [3.6] surface photometry and study structural relations of stellar and gas disks. We find that both the stellar mass–H i mass relation and the stellar radius–H i radius relation have significant intrinsic scatter, while the H i mass–radius relation is extremely tight. We build detailed mass models and quantify the ratio of baryonic to observed velocity (Vbar/Vobs) for different characteristic radii and values of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (ϒ⋆) at [3.6]. Assuming ϒ⋆ ≃ 0.5 M⊙/L⊙ (as suggested by stellar population models), we find that (i) the gas fraction linearly correlates with total luminosity; (ii) the transition from star-dominated to gas-dominated galaxies roughly corresponds to the transition from spiral galaxies to dwarf irregulars, in line with density wave theory; and (iii) Vbar/Vobs varies with luminosity and surface brightness: high-mass, high-surface-brightness galaxies are nearly maximal, while low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies are submaximal. These basic properties are lost for low values of ϒ⋆ ≃ 0.2 M⊙/L⊙ as suggested by the DiskMass survey. The mean maximum-disk limit in bright galaxies is ϒ⋆ ≃ 0.7 M⊙/L⊙ at [3.6]. The SPARC data are publicly available and represent an ideal test bed for models of galaxy formation.}},

Initial conditions constrained by the observed peculiar velocity of nearby galaxies are employed to accurately simulate the local cosmography. Halo pairs that resemble the Local Group are found in low resolutions constrained, dark matter only simulations, and selected for higher resolution magneto hydrodynamic simulation using the arepo code. Baryonic physics follows the auriga model of galaxy formation. The simulations contain a high-resolution region of 3–5 Mpc in radius from the Local Group mid-point embedded in the correct cosmographic landscape. Within this region, a simulated Local Group consisting of a Milky Way and Andromeda like galaxy forms, whose description is in excellent agreement with observations. The simulated Local Group galaxies resemble the Milky Way and Andromeda in terms of their halo mass, mass ratio, stellar disc mass, morphology separation, relative velocity, rotation curves, bulge-disc morphology, satellite galaxy stellar mass function, satellite radial distribution, and in some cases, the presence of a Magellanic cloud like object. Because these simulations properly model the Local Group in their cosmographic context, they provide a testing ground for questions where environment is thought to play an important role.}},

abstract = {{The exponential scale length (L d ) of the Milky Way’s (MW’s) disk is a critical parameter for describing the global physical size of our Galaxy, important both for interpreting other Galactic measurements and helping us to understand how our Galaxy fits into extragalactic contexts. Unfortunately, current estimates span a wide range of values and are often statistically incompatible with one another. Here, we perform a Bayesian meta-analysis to determine an improved, aggregate estimate for L d , utilizing a mixture-model approach to account for the possibility that any one measurement has not properly accounted for all statistical or systematic errors. Within this machinery, we explore a variety of ways of modeling the nature of problematic measurements, and then employ a Bayesian model averaging technique to derive net posterior distributions that incorporate any model-selection uncertainty. Our meta-analysis combines 29 different (15 visible and 14 infrared) photometric measurements of L d available in the literature; these involve a broad assortment of observational data sets, MW models and assumptions, and methodologies, all tabulated herein. Analyzing the visible and infrared measurements separately yields estimates for L d of \{2.71\}-0.20+0.22 kpc and \{2.51\}-0.13+0.15 kpc, respectively, whereas considering them all combined yields 2.64 ± 0.13 kpc. The ratio between the visible and infrared scale lengths determined here is very similar to that measured in external spiral galaxies. We use these results to update the model of the Galactic disk from our previous work, constraining its stellar mass to be \{4.8\}-1.1+1.5× \{10\}10 M ⊙, and the MW’s total stellar mass to be \{5.7\}-1.1+1.5× \{10\}10 M ⊙.}},

abstract = {{We present improved estimates of several global properties of the Milky Way, including its current star formation rate (SFR), the stellar mass contained in its disk and bulge+bar components, as well as its total stellar mass. We do so by combining previous measurements from the literature using a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) statistical method that allows us to account for the possibility that any value may be incorrect or have underestimated errors. We show that this method is robust to a wide variety of assumptions about the nature of problems in individual measurements or error estimates. Ultimately, our analysis yields an SFR for the Galaxy of \{\{\textbackslashdot\{M\}\}\textbackslashstar \}=1.65+/- 0.19 \{\{M\}⊙ \} y\{\{r\}-1\}, assuming a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). By combining HB methods with Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate the latest estimates of the Galactocentric radius of the Sun, R0, the exponential scale length of the disk, Ld, and the local surface density of stellar mass, \{\{Σ\}\textbackslashstar \}(\{\{R\}0\}), we show that the mass of the Galactic bulge+bar is M\textbackslashstar B=0.91+/- 0.07× \{\{10\}10\} \{\{M\}⊙ \}, the disk mass is M\textbackslashstar D=5.17+/- 1.11× \{\{10\}10\} \{\{M\}⊙ \}, and their combination yields a total stellar mass of \{\{M\}\textbackslashstar \}=6.08+/- 1.14× \{\{10\}10\} \{\{M\}⊙ \} (assuming a Kroupa IMF and an exponential disk profile). This analysis is based upon a new compilation of literature bulge mass estimates, normalized to common assumptions about the stellar IMF and Galactic disk properties, presented herein. We additionally find a bulge-to-total mass ratio for the Milky Way of B/T=0.150-0.019+0.028 and a specific SFR of \{\{\textbackslashdot\{M\}\}\textbackslashstar \}/\{\{M\}\textbackslashstar \}=2.71+/- 0.59× \{\{10\}-11\} yr-1.}},

TNG predicts flat circular velocity curves for z = 0 Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies beyond a few kpc from the galaxy centre, in better agreement with observational constraints than its predecessor, Illustris. TNG also predicts an enhancement of the dark matter mass within the 3D stellar half-mass radius (r\_half; M\_200c = 10\textasciicircum\{10\}-10\textasciicircum\{13\} M\_\{⊙ \}, z ≤ 2) compared to its dark matter only and Illustris counterparts. This enhancement leads TNG present-day galaxies to be dominated by dark matter within their inner regions, with f\_DM(< r\_half)≳ 0.5 at all masses and with a minimum for MW-mass galaxies. The 1σ scatter is ≲10 per cent at all apertures, which is smaller than that inferred by some observational data sets, e.g. 40 per cent from the SLUGGS survey. TNG agrees with the majority of the observationally inferred values for elliptical galaxies once a consistent initial mass function is adopted (Chabrier) and the DMFs are measured within the same apertures. The DMFs measured within r\_half increase towards lower redshifts: this evolution is dominated by the increase in galaxy size with time. At z ˜ 2, the DMF in disc-like TNG galaxies decreases with increasing galaxy mass, with f\_DM(< r\_half) ˜ 0.10-0.65 for 1010 ≲ Mstars/M⊙ ≲ 1012, and are two times higher than if TNG galaxies resided in Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter haloes unaffected by baryonic physics. It remains to be properly assessed whether recent observational estimates of the DMFs at z ˜ 2 rule out the contraction of the dark matter haloes predicted by the TNG model.}},

Upon completion, the SAGA Survey will spectroscopically identify satellite galaxies brighter than M r,o = −12.3 around 100 Milky Way (MW) analogs at z ∼ 0.01. In Stage II, we have more than quadrupled the sample size of Stage I, delivering results from 127 satellites around 36 MW analogs with an improved target selection strategy and deep photometric imaging catalogs from the Dark Energy Survey and the Legacy Surveys. We have obtained 25,372 galaxy redshifts, peaking around z = 0.2. These data significantly increase spectroscopic coverage for very low redshift objects in 17 < r o < 20.75 around SAGA hosts, creating a unique data set that places the Local Group in a wider context. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges from zero to nine and correlates with host galaxy and brightest satellite luminosities. We find that the number and luminosities of MW satellites are consistent with being drawn from the same underlying distribution as SAGA systems. The majority of confirmed SAGA satellites are star-forming, and the quenched fraction increases as satellite stellar mass and projected radius from the host galaxy decrease. Overall, the satellite quenched fraction among SAGA systems is lower than that in the Local Group. We compare the luminosity functions and radial distributions of SAGA satellites with theoretical predictions based on cold dark matter simulations and an empirical galaxy–halo connection model and find that the results are broadly in agreement.}},

abstract = {{We determine the velocity vector of M31 with respect to the Milky Way and use this to constrain the mass of the Local Group, based on Hubble Space Telescope proper-motion measurements of three fields presented in Paper I. We construct N-body models for M31 to correct the measurements for the contributions from stellar motions internal to M31. This yields an unbiased estimate for the M31 center-of-mass motion. We also estimate the center-of-mass motion independently, using the kinematics of satellite galaxies of M31 and the Local Group, following previous work but with an expanded satellite sample. All estimates are mutually consistent, and imply a weighted average M31 heliocentric transverse velocity of (vW , vN ) = (– 125.2 ± 30.8, –73.8 ± 28.4) km s–1. We correct for the reflex motion of the Sun using the most recent insights into the solar motion within the Milky Way, which imply a larger azimuthal velocity than previously believed. This implies a radial velocity of M31 with respect to the Milky Way of V rad, M31 = –109.3 ± 4.4 km s–1, and a tangential velocity of V tan, M31 = 17.0 km s–1, with a 1σ confidence region of V tan, M31 ≤ 34.3 km s–1. Hence, the velocity vector of M31 is statistically consistent with a radial (head-on collision) orbit toward the Milky Way. We revise prior estimates for the Local Group timing mass, including corrections for cosmic bias and scatter, and obtain M LG ≡ M MW, vir + M M31, vir = (4.93 ± 1.63) × 1012 M ☉. Summing known estimates for the individual masses of M31 and the Milky Way obtained from other dynamical methods yields smaller uncertainties. Bayesian combination of the different estimates demonstrates that the timing argument has too much (cosmic) scatter to help much in reducing uncertainties on the Local Group mass, but its inclusion does tend to increase other estimates by \textbackslashtextasciitilde10\%. We derive a final estimate for the Local Group mass from literature and new considerations of M LG = (3.17 ± 0.57) × 1012 M ☉.

Our simulations form in most of the eight haloes strongly disc-dominated systems with realistic rotation curves, close to exponential surface density profiles, a stellar mass to halo mass ratio that matches expectations from abundance matching techniques, and galaxy sizes and ages consistent with expectations from large galaxy surveys in the local Universe. There is no evidence for any dark matter core formation in our simulations, even so they include repeated baryonic outflows by supernova-driven winds and black hole quasar feedback. For one of our haloes, the object studied in the recent ‘Aquila’ code comparison project, we carried out a resolution study with our techniques, covering a dynamic range of 64 in mass resolution. Without any change in our feedback parameters, the final galaxy properties are reassuringly similar, in contrast to other modelling techniques used in the field that are inherently resolution dependent. This success in producing realistic disc galaxies is reached, in the context of our interstellar medium treatment, without resorting to a high density threshold for star formation, a low star formation efficiency, or early stellar feedback, factors deemed crucial for disc formation by other recent numerical studies.}},

The radio emission surface brightness profiles of our most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement with VLA measurements of Coma and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended radio haloes as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different instruments.

More violent merger or gas accretion histories lead to galaxies with more prominent bulges. Most disk galaxies have a bulge Sérsic index n ≤ 2.

This distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of environments, from the satellite systems of the MW and M31, to the quasi-isolated dwarfs in the outer regions of the Local Group, to the numerous isolated galaxies that are found in its surroundings. It extends to, but does not include, the galaxies associated with the next nearest groups, such as Maffei, Sculptor, and IC 342. Our basic knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming years with existing and future observational capabilities, and they will continue to provide the most detailed information available on numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Basic observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes, mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current online resource.

We previously measured the location of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) for Andromeda I, Andromeda II and M33 to within systematic uncertainties of typically <0.05 mag. As the TRGB acts as a standard candle in old, metal-poor stellar populations, we were able to derive distances to each of these galaxies.

The observations for each of the dwarf galaxies were intentionally taken in photometric conditions. In addition to the distances, we also self-consistently derive the median metallicity of each system from the colour of their red giant branches. This allows us to take into account the small metallicity variation of the absolute I magnitude of the TRGB. The homogeneous nature of our data and the identical analysis applied to each of the 17 Local Group galaxies ensures that these estimates form a reliable set of distance and metallicity determinations that are ideal for comparative studies of Local Group galaxy properties.}},

We produce stellar mass maps as well as mock g- and r-band images for randomly oriented simulated galaxies, convolving the latter with the Dragonfly point spread function (PSF) and taking care to match the background noise, surface brightness limits, and spatial resolution of DNGS. We measure azimuthally averaged stellar mass density and surface brightness profiles, and find that the DNGS galaxies generally have less stellar mass (or light) at large radii (>20 kpc) compared to their mass-matched TNG100 counterparts, and that simulated galaxies with similar surface density profiles tend to have low accreted mass fractions for their stellar mass. We explore potential solutions to this apparent 'missing outskirts problem' by implementing several ad hoc adjustments within TNG100 at the stellar particle level. Although we are unable to identify any single adjustment that fully reconciles the differences between the observed and simulated galaxy outskirts, we find that artificially delaying the disruption of satellite galaxies and reducing the spatial extent of in-situ stellar populations result in improved matches between the outer profile shapes and stellar halo masses, respectively. Further insight can be achieved with higher resolution simulations that are able to better resolve satellite accretion, and with larger samples of observed galaxies.}},

abstract = {{Physical and chemical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) at subgalactic (∼kiloparsec) scales play an indispensable role in controlling the ability of gas to form stars. In this paper, we use the TNG50 cosmological simulation to explore the physical parameter space of eight resolved ISM properties in star-forming regions to constrain the areas of this hyperspace where most star-forming environments exist. We deconstruct our simulated galaxies spanning a wide range of mass (M ⋆ = 107–1011 M ⊙) and redshift (0 ≤ z ≤ 3) into kiloparsec-sized regions and statistically analyze the gas/stellar surface densities, gas metallicity, vertical stellar velocity dispersion, epicyclic frequency, and dark-matter volumetric density representative of each region in the context of their star formation activity and environment (radial galactocentric location). By examining the star formation rate (SFR) weighted distributions of these properties, we show that stars primarily form in two distinct environmental regimes, which are brought about by an underlying bicomponent radial SFR profile in galaxies. We examine how the relative prominence of these regimes depends on galaxy mass and cosmic time. We also compare our findings with those from integral field spectroscopy observations and find similarities as well as departures. Further, using dimensionality reduction, we characterize the aforementioned hyperspace to reveal a high degree of multicollinearity in relationships among ISM properties that drive the distribution of star formation at kiloparsec scales. Based on this, we show that a reduced 3D representation underpinned by a multivariate radius relationship is sufficient to capture most of the variance in the original 8D space.}},

Here we investigate the distribution of elements within stars in the IllustrisTNG simulations. In particular, we analyze the abundance ratios of magnesium and europium in Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG100 simulation (stellar masses \$\{\textbackslashlog\} (M\_\textbackslashstar / \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\textbackslashodot) \textbackslashsim 9.7 - 11.2\$). As abundances of magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way are observed across a variety of spatial locations and metallicities, comparison with the stellar abundances in our more than \$850\$ Milky Way-like galaxies provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. To this end we use the magnesium to iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII and SNIa metal return prescription, and a means to compare our simulated abundances to a wide variety of galactic observations. The europium to iron ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star -- neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site of europium production in our models, which in turn is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in Milky Way-like galaxies show no correlation with assembly history, present day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar population age. In general, we reproduce the europium to iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, with the level of enhancement being sensitive to gas properties during redshifts \$z \textbackslashapprox 2-4\$. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is very robust.}},

Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.}},

Modeling the ionization states of simulated oxygen, we find good agreement with observations of the low-redshift OVI column density distribution function (CDDF), and present its evolution for all three ions from z=0 to z=4. Producing mock quasar absorption line spectral surveys, we show that the IllustrisTNG simulations are fully consistent with constraints on the OVI content of the CGM from COS-Halos and other low redshift observations, producing columns as high as observed. We measure the total amount of mass and average column densities of each ion using hundreds of thousands of simulated galaxies spanning 10\textasciicircum11 < Mhalo/Msun < 10\textasciicircum15 corresponding to 10\textasciicircum9 < M*/Msun < 10\textasciicircum12 in stellar mass. Stacked radial profiles of OVI are computed in 3D number density and 2D projected column, decomposing into the 1-halo and 2-halo terms. Relating halo OVI to properties of the central galaxy, we find a correlation between the (g-r) color of a galaxy and the total amount of OVI in its CGM. In comparison to the COS-Halos finding, this leads to a dichotomy of columns around star-forming versus passive galaxies at fixed stellar (or halo) mass. We demonstrate that this correlation is a direct result of blackhole feedback associated with quenching and represents a causal consequence of galactic-scale baryonic feedback impacting the physical state of the circumgalactic medium.}},

Contrasting integrated star formation rates (SFRs), we find that the slope and normalization of the star-forming main sequence in TNG50 are quantitatively consistent with values derived by fitting observations from 3D-HST with the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. The previous offsets of 0.2-1 dex between observed and simulated main sequence normalizations are resolved when using the updated masses and SFRs from Prospector. The scatter is generically smaller in TNG50 than in 3D-HST for more massive galaxies with M*>1010M⊙, by ∼10–40 per cent, after accounting for observational uncertainties. When comparing resolved star formation, we also find good agreement between TNG50 and 3D-HST: average specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles of galaxies at all masses and radii below, on, and above the SFMS are similar in both normalization and shape. Most noteworthy, massive galaxies with M*>1010.5M⊙, which have fallen below the SFMS due to ongoing quenching, exhibit a clear central SFR suppression, in both TNG50 and 3D-HST. In contrast, the original Illustris simulation and a variant TNG run without black hole kinetic wind feedback, do not reproduce the central SFR profile suppression seen in data. In TNG, inside-out quenching is due to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback model operating at low accretion rates.}},

We discover a significant abundance of small-scale, cold gas structure in the CGM of 'red and dead' elliptical systems, as traced by neutral H I and Mg II. Halos can host tens of thousands of discrete absorbing cloudlets, with sizes of order a kpc or smaller. With a Lagrangian tracer analysis, we show that cold clouds form due to strong \$\textbackslashdelta \textbackslashrho / \textbackslashbar\{\textbackslashrho \} \textbackslashgg 1\$ gas density perturbations that stimulate thermal instability. These local overdensities trigger rapid cooling from the hot virialized background medium at ∼107 K to radiatively inefficient ∼104 K clouds, which act as cosmologically long-lived, 'stimulated cooling' seeds in a regime where the global halo does not satisfy the classic tcool/tff < 10 criterion. Furthermore, these small clouds are dominated by magnetic rather than thermal pressure, with plasma β ≪ 1, suggesting that magnetic fields may play an important role. The number and total mass of cold clouds both increase with resolution, and the mgas ≃ 8 × 104 M⊙ cell mass of TNG50 enables the ∼ few hundred pc, small-scale CGM structure we observe to form. Finally, we make a preliminary comparison against observations from the COS-LRG, LRG-RDR, COS-Halos, and SDSS LRG surveys. We broadly find that our recent, high-resolution cosmological simulations produce sufficiently high covering fractions of extended, cold gas as observed to surround massive galaxies.}},

We find that the outflow mass loading is a non-monotonic function of galaxy stellar mass, turning over and rising rapidly above 1010.5 M⊙ due to the action of the central black hole. Outflow velocity increases with stellar mass, and at fixed mass is faster at higher redshift. The TNG model can produce high velocity, multi-phase outflows which include cool, dense components. These outflows reach speeds in excess of 3000 km/s out to 20 kpc with an ejective, BH-driven origin. Critically, we show how the relative simplicity of model inputs (and scalings) at the injection scale produces complex behavior at galactic and halo scales. For example, despite isotropic wind launching, outflows exhibit natural collimation and an emergent bipolarity. Furthermore, galaxies above the star-forming main sequence drive faster outflows, although this correlation inverts at high mass with the onset of quenching, whereby low luminosity, slowly accreting, massive black holes drive the strongest outflows.}},

abstract = {Magnetic fields are known to be dynamically important in the interstellar medium of our own Galaxy, and they are ubiquitously observed in diffuse gas in the haloes of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Yet, magnetic fields have typically been neglected in studies of the formation of galaxies, leaving their global influence on galaxy formation largely unclear. Here we extend our magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) implementation in the moving-mesh code Arepo to cosmological problems which include radiative cooling and the formation of stars. In particular, we replace our previously employed divergence cleaning approach with a Powell eight-wave scheme, which turns out to be significantly more stable, even in very dynamic environments. We verify the improved accuracy through simulations of the magneto-rotational instability in accretion discs, which reproduce the correct linear growth rate of the instability. Using this new MHD code, we simulate the formation of isolated disc galaxies similar to the Milky Way using idealized initial conditions with and without magnetic fields. We find that the magnetic field strength is quickly amplified in the initial central starburst and the differential rotation of the forming disc, eventually reaching a saturation value. At this point, the magnetic field pressure in the interstellar medium becomes comparable to the thermal pressure, and a further efficient growth of the magnetic field strength is prevented. The additional pressure component leads to a lower star formation rate at late times compared to simulations without magnetic fields, and induces changes in the spiral arm structures of the gas disc. In addition, we observe highly magnetized fountain-like outflows from the disc. These results are robust with numerical resolution and are largely independent of the initial magnetic seed field strength assumed in the initial conditions, as the amplification process is rapid and self-regulated. Our findings suggest an important influence of magnetic fields on galaxy formation and evolution, cautioning against their neglect in theoretical models of structure formation.},

abstract = {{Magnetic fields play an important role in astrophysics on a wide variety of scales, ranging from the Sun and compact objects to galaxies and galaxy clusters. Here we discuss a novel implementation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the moving-mesh code arepo which combines many of the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian methods in a single computational technique. The employed grid is defined as the Voronoi tessellation of a set of mesh-generating points which can move along with the flow, yielding an automatic adaptivity of the mesh and a substantial reduction of advection errors. Our scheme solves the MHD Riemann problem in the rest frame of the Voronoi interfaces using the HLLD Riemann solver. To satisfy the divergence constraint of the magnetic field in multiple dimensions, the Dedner divergence cleaning method is applied. In a set of standard test problems, we show that the new code produces accurate results and that the divergence of the magnetic field is kept sufficiently small to closely preserve the correct physical solution. We also apply the code to two first application problems, namely supersonic MHD turbulence and the spherical collapse of a magnetized cloud. We verify that the code is able to handle both problems well, demonstrating the applicability of this MHD version of arepo to a wide range of problems in astrophysics.}},

However, the origin of these strong magnetic fields is still unclear, and most previous attempts to simulate galaxy formation from cosmological initial conditions have ignored them altogether. Here, we analyse the magnetic fields predicted by the simulations of the Auriga Project, a set of 30 high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of Milky\textbackslashtextasciitildeWay-like galaxies, carried out with a moving-mesh magneto-hydrodynamics code and a detailed galaxy formation physics model. We find that the magnetic fields grow exponentially at early times owing to a small-scale dynamo with an e-folding time of roughly \$100\textbackslash,\textbackslashrm\{Myr\}\$ in the center of halos until saturation occurs around \$z=2-3\$, when the magnetic energy density reaches about \$10\textbackslash\%\$ of the turbulent energy density with a typical strength of \$10-50\textbackslash,\textbackslashrm\{\textbackslashmu G\}\$. In the galactic centers the ratio between magnetic and turbulent energy remains nearly constant until \$z=0\$. At larger radii, differential rotation in the disks leads to linear amplification that typically saturates around \$z=0.5\$ to \$z=0\$. The final radial and vertical variations of the magnetic field strength can be well described by two joint exponential profiles, and are in good agreement with observational constraints. Overall, the magnetic fields have only little effect on the global evolution of the galaxies as it takes too long to reach equipartition. We also demonstrate that our results are well converged with numerical resolution.}},

The Large Magellanic Cloud has traditionally served as the best galaxy with which to calibrate Cepheid period–luminosity relations, and as a result has become the best anchor point for the cosmic distance scale4,5. Eclipsing binary systems composed of late-type stars offer the most precise and accurate way to measure the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Here we report a calibration of the surface brightness–colour relation with a precision of 0.8 per cent. We use this calibration to determine a geometrical distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud that is precise to 1 per cent based on 20 eclipsing binary systems. The final distance is 49.59 ± 0.09 (statistical) ± 0.54 (systematic) kiloparsecs.

Two-thirds of the 198 MW/M31 analogues inspected in TNG50 at z = 0 show one or more large-scale, coherent features of overpressurized gas that impinge into the gaseous halo. Some of the galaxies include a succession of bubbles or shells of increasing size, ranging from a few to many tens of kpc. These are prominent in gas pressure, X-ray emission, and gas temperature, and often exhibit sharp boundaries with typical shock Mach numbers of 2–4. The gas in the bubbles outflows with maximum (95th pctl) radial velocities of ∼100–1500 km s−1. TNG50 bubbles expand with speeds as high as 1000–2000 km s−1 (about 1–2 kpc Myr−1), but with a great diversity and with larger bubbles expanding at slower speeds. The bubble gas is at 106.4−7.2 K temperatures and is enriched to metallicities of \$0.5-2\textbackslashtextasciitilde\textbackslashrm Z\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\$. In TNG50, the bubbles are a manifestation of episodic, kinetic, wind-like energy injections from the supermassive black holes at the galaxy centres that accrete at low Eddington ratios. According to TNG50, X-ray, and possibly γ-ray, bubbles similar to those observed in the Milky Way should be a frequent feature of disc-like galaxies prior to, or on the verge of, being quenched. They should be within the grasp of eROSITA in the local Universe.}},

The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and multi-mode feedback. In this paper we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances which form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content, and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black hole driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics, and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc \$h\textasciicircum\{-1\}\$)\$\textasciicircum3\$ cosmological boxes we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of \$10\textasciicircum\{12\} M\_\{\textbackslashrm sun\}\$ haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low mass end of the galaxy population.}},

At fixed halo mass, we show that disk-like, blue, young, and more massive galaxies are surrounded by significantly steeper stellar haloes than elliptical, red, older, and less massive galaxies. Overall, the stellar density profiles fall off much more steeply than the underlying DM, and no clear trend holds between stellar slope and DM halo concentration. However, DM haloes which formed more recently, or which accreted larger fractions of stellar mass from infalling satellites, exhibit shallower stellar haloes than their older analogs with similar masses, by up to Delta(alphaSTARS) \textbackslashtextasciitilde 0.5-0.7.

Our model predicts that for star-forming galaxies the fraction of disc-like morphologies, based on 3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time and galaxy stellar mass. Gas kinematics reveal that the vast majority of |\$10\textasciicircum\{9-11.5\}\textbackslash, \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\$| star-forming galaxies are rotationally supported discs for most cosmic epochs (Vrot/σ > 2–3, |\$z\$| ≲ 5), being dynamically hotter at earlier epochs (⁠|\$z\$| ≳ 1.5).

The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intra-cluster light. The exact ICL fraction depends sensitively on the definition of a central galaxy's mass and varies in our most massive clusters between 20 to 40\% of the total stellar mass. Haloes of \$5\textbackslashtimes 10\textasciicircum\{14\}M\_\{\textbackslashrm sun\}\$ and above have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's ( \$-3.5 < \textbackslashalpha\_\{\textbackslashrm 3D\} < -3\$).

Our approach couples an observationally motivated model for the stellar mass and star formation rate distribution of galaxies with empirical scaling relations to predict the dust continuum flux density of these galaxies. Without a need to tweak the IMF, the model reproduces the currently available observations of the 1.1 mm and 850 μm number counts, including the observed flattening in the 1.1 mm number counts below 0.3 mJy and the number counts in discrete bins of different galaxy properties. Predictions of our work include the following: (1) the galaxies that dominate the number counts at flux densities below 1 mJy (3 mJy) at 1.1 mm (850 μm) have redshifts between z = 1 and z = 2, stellar masses of ∼5 × 1010 M⊙, and dust masses of ∼108 M⊙; (2) the flattening in the observed 1.1 mm number counts corresponds to the knee of the 1.1 mm luminosity function. A similar flattening is predicted for the number counts at 850 μm; (3) the model reproduces the redshift distribution of current 1.1 mm detections; and (4) to efficiently detect large numbers of galaxies through their dust continuum, future surveys should scan large areas once reaching a 1.1 mm flux density of 0.1 mJy rather than integrating to fainter fluxes. Our modeling framework also suggests that the amount of information on galaxy physics that can be extracted from the 1.1 mm and 850 μm number counts is almost exhausted.}},

The fractions of mass and angular momentum retained in the baryonic and stellar components of disc galaxies put strong constraints on our understanding of galaxy formation. In this work, we derive the fraction of angular momentum retained in the stellar component of spirals, fj, the global star formation efficiency fM, and the ratio of the asymptotic circular velocity (Vflat) to the virial velocity fV, and their scatter, by fitting simultaneously the observed stellar mass-velocity (Tully–Fisher), size–mass, and mass–angular momentum (Fall) relations. We compare the goodness of fit of three models: (i) where the logarithm of fj, fM, and fV vary linearly with the logarithm of the observable Vflat; (ii) where these values vary as a double power law; and (iii) where these values also vary as a double power law but with a prior imposed on fM such that it follows the expectations from widely used abundance matching models. We conclude that the scatter in these fractions is particularly small (∼0.07 dex) and that the linear model is by far statistically preferred to that with abundance matching priors. This indicates that the fundamental galaxy formation parameters are small-scatter single-slope monotonic functions of mass, instead of being complicated non-monotonic functions. This incidentally confirms that the most massive spiral galaxies should have turned nearly all the baryons associated with their haloes into stars. We call this the failed feedback problem.}},

We find LSBGs of all stellar masses, although they are particularly prevalent at M* < 1010 M⊙. We show that the specific star formation rates of LSBGs are not significantly different from those of high surface brightness galaxies (HSBGs) but that, as a population, LSBGs are systematically less massive and more extended than HSBGs, and tend to display late-type morphologies according to a kinematic criterion. At fixed stellar mass, we find that haloes hosting LSBGs are systematically more massive and have a higher baryonic fraction than those hosting HSBGs. We find that LSBGs have higher stellar specific angular momentum and halo spin parameter values compared to HSBGs, as suggested by previous works. We track the evolution of these quantities back in time, finding that the spin parameters of the haloes hosting LSBGs and HSBGs exhibit a clear bifurcation at z ∼ 2, which causes a similar separation in the evolutionary tracks of other properties such as galactic angular momentum and effective radius, ultimately resulting in the values observed at z = 0. The higher values of specific stellar angular momentum and halo spin in LSBGs seem to be responsible for their extended nature, preventing material from collapsing into the central regions of the galaxies, and also causing LSBGs to host less massive black holes at their centres.}},

The properties and abundance of CGM gas across the sample are diverse, and the fractional budgets of different phases (cold, warm, and hot), as well as neutral H i mass and metal mass, vary considerably. Over our stellar mass range of \$10\textasciicircum\{10.5\} < M\_\textbackslashstar /\{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\textbackslashodot < 10\textasciicircum\{10.9\}\$, radial profiles of gas physical properties from \$0.15 < R/R\_\{\textbackslashrm 200c\} < 1.0\$ reveal great CGM structural complexity, with significant variations both at fixed distance around individual galaxies, and across different galaxies. CGM gas is multiphase: the distributions of density, temperature, and entropy are all multimodal, while metallicity and thermal pressure distributions are unimodal; all are broad. We present predictions for magnetic fields in MW-like haloes: a median field strength of \$|B|\textbackslashsim 1\textbackslash,\textbackslashmu\{\textbackslashrm G\}\$ in the inner halo decreases rapidly at larger distance, while magnetic pressure dominates over thermal pressure only within \$\{\textbackslashsim\}0.2 \textbackslashtimes R\_\{\textbackslashrm 200c\}\$.

Finally, the physical properties of the CGM are tightly connected to the galactic star formation rate, in turn dependent on feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In TNG50, we find that energy from SMBH-driven kinetic winds generates high-velocity outflows (≳500–2000 km s−1), heats gas to supervirial temperatures (>106.5–7 K), and regulates the net balance of inflows versus outflows in otherwise quasi-static gaseous haloes.}},

This is the first Galaxy-wide measurement derived from pre-main-sequence objects themselves, rather than global observables such as the total radio continuum, Hα, or FIR flux. The value obtained is slightly lower than, but generally consistent with previously determined values. We will extend this method in the future to fit the brightness, color, and angular distribution of YSOs, and simultaneously make use of multiple surveys, to place constraints on the input assumptions, and reduce uncertainties in the SFR estimate. Ultimately, this will be one of the most accurate methods for determining the Galactic SFR, as it makes use of stars of all masses (limited only by sensitivity) rather than solely massive stars or indirect tracers of massive stars.}},

We study this hypothesis by considering approximately 18,000 central galaxies at \$z=0\$ with stellar masses \$M\_\{\textbackslashast\} = 10\textasciicircum\{9\}-10\textasciicircum\{12\} \textbackslash, \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot\}\$ selected from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. The fraction of accreted stars -- which measures the importance of massive, recent and dry mergers -- increases steeply with galaxy stellar mass, from less than 5 per cent in dwarfs to 80 per cent in the most massive objects, and the impact of mergers on galaxy morphology increases accordingly. For galaxies with \$M\_\{\textbackslashast\} \textbackslashgtrsim 10\textasciicircum\{11\} \textbackslash, \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot\}\$, mergers have the expected effect: if gas-poor they promote the formation of spheroidal galaxies, whereas gas-rich mergers favour the formation and survivability of massive discs. This trend, however, breaks at lower masses. For objects with \$M\_\{\textbackslashast\} \textbackslashlesssim 10\textasciicircum\{11\} \textbackslash, \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot\}\$, mergers do not seem to play any significant role in determining the morphology, with accreted stellar fractions and mean merger gas fractions that are indistinguishable between spheroidal and disc-dominated galaxies. On the other hand, halo spin correlates with morphology primarily in the least massive objects in the sample (\$M\_\{\textbackslashast\} \textbackslashlesssim 10\textasciicircum\{10\} \textbackslash, \{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot\}\$), but only weakly for galaxies above that mass. Our results support a scenario where (1) mergers play a dominant role in shaping the morphology of massive galaxies, (2) halo spin is important for the morphology of dwarfs, and (3) the morphology of medium-sized galaxies -- including the Milky Way -- shows little dependence on galaxy assembly history or halo spin, at least when these two factors are considered individually.}},

These merger trees are used to calculate the galaxy–galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellar mass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. We demonstrate that the most appropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy–galaxy merger consists in taking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reaches its maximum stellar mass. Additionally, we avoid effects from ‘orphaned’ galaxies by allowing some objects to ‘skip’ a snapshot when finding a descendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined ‘infall’ moment. Adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions for the galaxy–galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which are qualitatively similar to the halo–halo merger rate except for the last one: a strong correlation with redshift that evolves as ∼(1 + z)2.4–2.8, a power law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence on descendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellar masses greater than ∼2 × 1011 M⊙. These trends are consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙), but in tension with some recent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies (M* ≳ 1011 M⊙), which report a nearly constant or decreasing evolution with redshift.

Massive spiral galaxies are already present as early as z = 4, and bar formation takes place already at those early times. The bars grow longer and stronger as the host galaxies evolve, with the bar sizes increasing at a pace similar to that of the disc scalelengths. The bar fraction mildly evolves with redshift for galaxies with \$M\_\{*\}\textbackslashge 10\textasciicircum\{10\}\textbackslashrm M\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\$, being greater than \$\textbackslashsim 40\{\{\textbackslash \textbackslashrm per\textbackslash cent\}\}\$ at 0.5 < z < 3 and \$\textbackslashsim 30\{\{\textbackslash \textbackslashrm per\textbackslash cent\}\}\$ at z = 0. When bars larger than a given physical size (\$\textbackslashge 2\textbackslash, \textbackslashrm kpc\$) or the angular resolution limit of twice the I-band angular PSF FWHM of the HST are considered, the bar fraction dramatically decreases with increasing redshift, reconciling the theoretical predictions with observational data. We find that barred galaxies have an older stellar population, lower gas fractions, and star formation rates than unbarred galaxies. In most cases, the discs of barred galaxies assembled earlier and faster than the discs of unbarred galaxies. We also find that barred galaxies are typical in haloes with larger concentrations and smaller spin parameters than unbarred galaxies. Furthermore, the inner regions of barred galaxies are more baryon-dominated than those of unbarred galaxies but have comparable global stellar mass fractions. Our findings suggest that the bar population could be used as a potential tracer of the buildup of disc galaxies and their host haloes. With this paper, we release a catalogue of barred galaxies in TNG50 at six redshifts between z = 4 and 0.}},

abstract = {{We analyse the properties of strongly barred disc galaxies using the TNG100 simulation, a cosmological hydrodynamical realization of the IllustrisTNG suite. We identify 270 disc galaxies at z = 0 in the stellar mass range M\_\{*\}=10\textasciicircum\{10.4-11\} \{M\_\{⊙ \}\}, of which 40 per cent are barred. Of the detected bars, more than half are strong. We find that the fraction of barred galaxies increases with stellar mass, in agreement with observational results. Strongly barred galaxies exhibit, overall, lower gas-to-stellar mass ratios compared to unbarred galaxies. The majority of barred galaxies are quenched (sSFR ∼ 10-11.7 yr-1), whereas unbarred galaxies continue to be active (sSFR ∼ 10-10.3 yr-1) on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We explore the evolution of strongly barred and unbarred galaxies to investigate their formation and quenching histories. We find that strong bars form between 0.5 < z < 1.5, with more massive galaxies hosting older bars. Strong bars form in galaxies with an early-established prominent disc component, undergoing periods of enhanced star formation and black hole accretion, possibly assisted by cosmological inflows. Unbarred galaxies, on the other hand, assemble most of their mass and disc component at late times. The nuclear region of strongly barred galaxies quenches shortly after bar formation, while unbarred galaxies remain active across time. Our findings are indicative of bar quenching, possibly assisted by nuclear feedback processes. We conclude that the cosmological environment, together with small-scale feedback processes, determine the chances of a galaxy to form a bar and to rapidly quench its central region.}},

abstract = {{We discuss cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation performed with the new moving‐mesh code arepo, which promises higher accuracy compared with the traditional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique that has been widely employed for this problem. In this exploratory study, we deliberately limit the complexity of the physical processes followed by the code for ease of comparison with previous calculations, and include only cooling of gas with a primordial composition, heating by a spatially uniform ultraviolet background, and a simple subresolution model for regulating star formation in the dense interstellar medium. We use an identical set of physics in corresponding simulations carried out with the well‐tested SPH code gadget, adopting also the same high‐resolution gravity solver. We are thus able to compare both simulation sets on an object‐by‐object basis, allowing us to cleanly isolate the impact of different hydrodynamical methods on galaxy and halo properties. In accompanying papers, Vogelsberger et al. and Sijacki et al., we focus on an analysis of the global baryonic statistics predicted by the simulation codes, and complementary idealized simulations that highlight the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes. Here we investigate their influence on the baryonic properties of simulated galaxies and their surrounding haloes. We find that arepo leads to significantly higher star formation rates for galaxies in massive haloes and to more extended gaseous discs in galaxies, which also feature a thinner and smoother morphology than their gadget counterparts. Consequently, galaxies formed in arepo have larger sizes and higher specific angular momentum than their SPH correspondents. Interestingly, the more efficient cooling flows in arepo yield higher densities and lower entropies in halo centres compared to gadget, whereas the opposite trend is found in halo outskirts. The cooling differences leading to higher star formation rates of massive galaxies in arepo also slightly increase the baryon content within the virial radius of massive haloes. We show that these differences persist as a function of numerical resolution. While both codes agree to acceptable accuracy on a number of baryonic properties of cosmic structures, our results thus clearly demonstrate that galaxy formation simulations greatly benefit from the use of more accurate hydrodynamical techniques such as arepo and call into question the reliability of galaxy formation studies in a cosmological context using traditional standard formulations of SPH, such as the one implemented in gadget. Our new moving‐mesh simulations demonstrate that a population of extended gaseous discs of galaxies in large volume cosmological simulations can be formed even without energetic feedback in the form of galactic winds, although such outflows appear required to obtain realistic stellar masses.}},

abstract = {{In this study, we analyse the kinematics and dynamics of a homogeneous sample of red clump stars, selected from the second Gaia data release catalogue in the direction of the Galactic poles, at five different positions in the plane. The level of completeness of the sample at heights between 0.6 and 3.5 kpc was asserted through a comparison with the 2 Micron All Sky Survey catalogue. We show that both the density distribution and velocity dispersion are significantly more perturbed in the north than in the south in all analysed regions of our Galactic neighbourhoods. We provide a detailed assessment of these north-south asymmetries at large heights, which can provide useful constraints for models of the interaction of the Galactic disc with external perturbers. We proceeded to evaluate how such asymmetries could affect determinations of the dynamical matter density under equilibrium assumptions. We find that a Jeans analysis delivers relatively similar vertical forces and integrated dynamical surface densities at large heights above the plane in both hemispheres. At these heights, the densities of stars and gas are very low and the surface density is largely dominated by dark matter (DM), which allows us to estimate, separately in the north and in the south, the local dark matter density derived under equilibrium assumptions. In the presence of vertical perturbations, such values should be considered as an upper limit. This Jeans analysis yields values of the local dark matter density above 2 kpc, namely, ρDM ∼ 0.013 M⊙ pc−3 (∼0.509 GeV cm−3) in the perturbed northern hemisphere and ρDM ∼ 0.010 M⊙ pc−3 (∼0.374 GeV cm−3) in the much less perturbed south. As a comparison, we determine the local dark matter density by fitting a global phase-space distribution to the data. We end up with a value in the range of ρDM ∼ 0.011−0.014 M⊙ pc−3, which is in global agreement with the Jeans analysis. These results call for the further development of non-equilibrium methods with the aim of obtaining a more precise estimate for the dynamical matter density in the Galactic disc.}},

Using the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in baryonic simulations, we examine the radial distributions of satellites with M\_*> 10\textasciicircum5 M⊙ around eight isolated Milky Way (MW) mass host galaxies and four hosts in LG-like pairs. We demonstrate that these simulations resolve the survival and physical destruction of satellites with M\_*≳ 10\textasciicircum5 M⊙. The simulations broadly agree with LG observations, spanning the radial profiles around the MW and M31. This agreement does not depend strongly on satellite mass, even at distances ≲100 kpc. Host-to-host variation dominates the scatter in satellite counts within 300 kpc of the hosts, while time variation dominates scatter within 50 kpc. More massive host galaxies within our sample have fewer satellites at small distances, likely because of enhanced tidal destruction of satellites via the baryonic discs of host galaxies. Furthermore, we quantify and provide fits to the tidal depletion of subhaloes in baryonic relative to dark matter-only simulations as a function of distance. Our simulated profiles imply observational incompleteness in the LG even at M\_*≳ 10\textasciicircum5 M⊙: we predict 2-10 such satellites to be discovered around the MW and possibly 6-9 around M31. To provide cosmological context, we compare our results with the radial profiles of satellites around MW analogues in the SAGA survey, finding that our simulations are broadly consistent with most SAGA systems.}},

We present ananke, a framework for generating synthetic phase-space surveys from high-resolution baryonic simulations, and use it to generate a suite of synthetic surveys resembling Gaia DR2 in data structure, magnitude limits, and observational errors. We use three cosmological simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies from the Latte suite of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, which feature self-consistent clustering of star formation in dense molecular clouds and thin stellar/gaseous disks in live cosmological halos with satellite dwarf galaxies and stellar halos. We select three solar viewpoints from each simulation to generate nine synthetic Gaia-like surveys. We sample synthetic stars by assuming each star particle (of mass 7070 \$M\_\{\textbackslashodot\}\$) represents a single stellar population. At each viewpoint, we compute dust extinction from the simulated gas metallicity distribution and apply a simple error model to produce a synthetic Gaia-like survey that includes both observational properties and a pointer to the generating star particle. We provide the complete simulation snapshot at \$z = 0\$ for each simulated galaxy. We describe data access points, the data model, and plans for future upgrades.

From more than 60 000 simulations, we identify a hierarchy of LG characteristics emanating from different scales: the total mass, orientation, orbital energy, and the angular momentum are largely determined by modes above λ = 1.6 comoving Mpc (cMpc) in the primordial density field. Smaller scale variations are mostly manifest as perturbations to the MW–M31 orbit, and we find that the observables commonly used to describe the LG – the MW–M31 separation and radial velocity – are transient and depend on specifying scales down to 0.2 cMpc in the primordial density field. We further find that the presence of M33/LMC analogues significantly affects the MW–M31 orbit and its sensitivity to small-scale perturbations. We construct initial conditions that lead to the formation of an LG whose primary observables precisely match the current observations.}},

For example, observations of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement with N-body simulations of the "Lambda Cold Dark Matter" (\{\textbackslashLambda\}CDM) model: there are far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in cold dark matter halos (the "missing satellites" problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the most massive substructures (the "too-big-to-fail" problem); and the brightest satellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the "planes of satellites" problem). Here we present results from APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of twelve volumes selected to match the kinematics of the Local Group (LG) members. Applying the Eagle code to the LG environment, we find that our simulations match the observed abundance of LG galaxies, including the satellite galaxies of the MW and Andromeda. Due to changes to the structure of halos and the evolution in the LG environment, the simulations reproduce the observed relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individual dwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in their dark matter profiles. Satellite systems form with a range of spatial anisotropies, including one similar to that of the MW, confirming that such a configuration is not unexpected in \{\textbackslashLambda\}CDM. Finally, based on the observed velocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide new estimates of the maximum circular velocity for the halos of nine MW dwarf spheroidals.}},

Our simulations follow eight isolated haloes similar in mass to the Milky Way and extracted from a large cosmological simulation without restriction on spin parameter or merger history. This allows us to investigate how the final properties of the simulated galaxies correlate with the formation histories of their haloes. We find that, at z = 0, none of our galaxies contains a disc with more than 20 per cent of its total stellar mass. Four of the eight galaxies nevertheless have well-formed disc components, three have dominant spheroids and very small discs, and one is a spheroidal galaxy with no disc at all. The z = 0 spheroids are made of old stars, while discs are younger and formed from the inside-out. Neither the existence of a disc at z = 0 nor the final disc-to-total mass ratio seems to depend on the spin parameter of the halo. Discs are formed in haloes with spin parameters as low as 0.01 and as high as 0.05; galaxies with little or no disc component span the same range in spin parameter. Except for one of the simulated galaxies, all have significant discs at z >\textbackslashtextasciitilde 2, regardless of their z = 0 morphologies. Major mergers and instabilities which arise when accreting cold gas is misaligned with the stellar disc trigger a transfer of mass from the discs to the spheroids. In some cases, discs are destroyed, while in others, they survive or reform. This suggests that the survival probability of discs depends on the particular formation history of each galaxy. A realistic ΛCDM model will clearly require weaker star formation at high redshift and later disc assembly than occurs in our models.}},

We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to ≲ 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 < M*/M⊙ ≲ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully–Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C iv and O vi. While the mass–metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* ≳ 109 M⊙ (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.}},

Yet, most of these simulations have successfully reproduced some observations, such as the stellar mass function and star formation rate density in the local universe. We use the recent observation of the change in the neutral hydrogen gas mass (including both H2 and H I) with the star formation rate of massive central disk galaxies as a critical constraint of black hole feedback models across several simulations. We find that the predictions of IllustrisTNG agree with the observations much better than the other models tested in this work. This favors IllustrisTNG’s treatment of active galactic nuclei (AGN)—where kinetic winds are driven by black holes at low accretion rates—as more plausible among those we test. In turn, this also indirectly supports the idea that the massive central disk galaxy population in the local universe was likely quenched by AGN feedback.}},

We use Bayesian modelling of the optical-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) to estimate profiles of M31's stellar populations and mass along the major axis.

Fits to the gi-SED alone yield M/Li * that are systematically lower than the full SED fit by 0.1 dex. This is still smaller than the 0.3 dex scatter amongst different relations for M/Li via g - i colour found in the literature.

Our photometry database covers \textbackslashtextasciitilde14.9 deg2 and contains over 130,000 stars, of which approximately 70,000 are in a color range (0.4 ≤ R-I ≤ 1.5) for which relatively unambiguous photometric parallaxes can be derived. We discuss our photometry pipeline, our method of determining photometric parallaxes, and our analysis efforts. We also address the affects of Malmquist bias, subgiant/giant contamination, metallicity, and binary stars upon the derived density laws. The affect of binary stars is the most significant of these biases—a binary star fraction of 50\% could result in derived scale heights that are 80\% of the actual values. We find that while the disklike populations of the Milky Way are easily constrained in a simultaneous analysis of all seven fields, no good simultaneous solution for the halo is found. We have applied halo density laws taken from other studies and find that the Besançon flattened power-law halo model (c/a = 0.6,ρ ∝ r-2.75) produces the best fit to our data. With this halo, the thick disk has a scale height of 750 pc with an 8.5\% normalization to the old disk. The old-disk scale height is \textbackslashtextasciitilde280-300 pc for our early-type (5.8 ≤ MR < 6.8) dwarfs and rises to \textbackslashtextasciitilde 350 pc for our late-type (8.8 ≤ MR ≤ 10.2) dwarf stars. Corrected for a binary fraction of 50\%, these scale heights are 940 and 350-375 pc, respectively. Even with this model, there are systematic discrepancies between the observed and predicted density distributions—discrepancies apparent only at the faint magnitudes reached by our survey. Specifically, our model produces density overpredictions in the inner Galaxy and density underpredictions in the outer Galaxy. A possible escape from this dilemma is offered by modeling the stellar halo as a two-component system, as favored by studies of blue horizontal branch/RR Lyrae stars and recent analyses of the kinematics of metal-poor stars. In this paradigm, the halo has a flattened inner distribution and a roughly spherical but substructured outer distribution. Further reconciliation could be provided by a flared thick disk, a structure consistent with a merger origin for that population.}},

Illustris is a large scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulation which resolves a (106.5 Mpc)\textasciicircum3 volume with more than 12 billion resolution elements and includes state-of-the-art physical models relevant for galaxy formation. We find that the black hole mass density for redshifts z = 0 - 5 and the black hole mass function at z = 0 predicted by Illustris are in very good agreement with the most recent observational constraints. We show that the bolometric and hard X-ray luminosity functions of AGN at z = 0 and 1 reproduce observational data very well over the full dynamic range probed. Unless the bolometric corrections are largely underestimated, this requires radiative efficiencies to be on average low, epsilon\_r <= 0.1, noting however that in our model radiative efficiencies are degenerate with black hole feedback efficiencies. Cosmic downsizing of the AGN population is in broad agreement with the findings from X-ray surveys, but we predict a larger number density of faint AGN at high redshifts than currently inferred. We also study black hole -- host galaxy scaling relations as a function of galaxy morphology, colour and specific star formation rate. We find that black holes and galaxies co-evolve at the massive end, but for low mass, blue and star-forming galaxies there is no tight relation with either their central black hole masses or the nuclear AGN activity.}},

Through a variety of numerical experiments with increasing complexity we establish a clear link between simple test problems with known analytic solutions and systematic numerical effects seen in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Our tests demonstrate deficiencies of the SPH method in several sectors. These accuracy problems not only manifest themselves in idealized hydrodynamical tests, but also propagate to more realistic simulation set‐ups of galaxy formation, ultimately affecting local and global gas properties in the full cosmological framework, as highlighted in companion papers by Vogelsberger et al. and Keres et al. We find that an inadequate treatment of fluid instabilities in gadget suppresses entropy generation by mixing, underestimates vorticity generation in curved shocks and prevents efficient gas stripping from infalling substructures. Moreover, in idealized tests of inside‐out disc formation, the convergence rate of gas disc sizes is much slower in gadget due to spurious angular momentum transport. In simulations where we follow the interaction between a forming central disc and orbiting substructures in a massive halo, the final disc morphology is strikingly different in the two codes. In arepo, gas from infalling substructures is readily depleted and incorporated into the host halo atmosphere, facilitating the formation of an extended central disc. Conversely, gaseous sub‐clumps are more coherent in gadget simulations, morphologically transforming the central disc as they impact it. The numerical artefacts of the SPH solver are particularly severe for poorly resolved flows, and thus inevitably affect cosmological simulations due to their inherently hierarchical nature. Taken together, our numerical experiments clearly demonstrate that arepo delivers a physically more reliable solution.}},

For this, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and identify 198 analog galaxies, selected based on their z = 0 stellar mass (\$10\textasciicircum\{10.5-11.2\}\textbackslash, \textbackslashrm \{M\}\_\{\textbackslashodot \}\$), discy stellar morphology and local environment. First, major mergers are common: 85 per cent (168) of MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50 have undergone at least one major merger across their lifetime. In fact, 31 galaxies (16 per cent) have undergone a recent major merger, i.e. in the last 5 Gyr. The gas available during the merger suffices to either induce starbursts at pericentric passages or to sustain prolonged star formation after coalescence: in roughly half of the cases, the pre-existing stellar disc is destroyed because of the merger but reforms thanks to star formation. Moreover, higher merger mass ratios are more likely to destroy the stellar discs. In comparison to those with more ancient massive mergers, MW/M31-like galaxies with recent major mergers have, on average, somewhat thicker stellar discs, more massive and somewhat shallower stellar haloes, larger stellar ex situ mass fractions, but similarly massive kinematically defined bulges. All this is qualitatively consistent with the different observed properties of the Galaxy and Andromeda and with the constraints on their most recent major mergers, 8–11 and  2 Gyr ago, respectively. According to contemporary cosmological simulations, a recent quiet merger history is not a pre-requisite for obtaining a relatively thin stellar disc at z = 0.}},

In our largest simulation, we resolve nearly 300 000 gravitationally bound subhaloes within the virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass resolution by factors of up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhaloes with the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhaloes within subhaloes, but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhaloes than in the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhaloes than in the main halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3 per cent within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1 per cent within the solar circle. The inner density profiles of subhaloes show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well fitted by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of isolated haloes are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km s−1, an extrapolation over some five orders of magnitude in mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity, subhaloes are more concentrated than field haloes, with a characteristic density that is typically ∼2.6 times larger and increases with decreasing distance from halo centre.}},

This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology–radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters.

Here we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k \textbackslashtextasciitilde 10 h/Mpc by 20\%. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present.

Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples.

abstract = {{Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code arepo, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.}},

While supernova feedback alone can reduce star formation enough to match the stellar mass–halo mass relationship, the galaxy forms too many stars before z = 2 to match the evolution seen using abundance matching. Our early stellar feedback is purely thermal and thus operates like an ultraviolet ionization source as well as providing some additional pressure from the radiation of massive, young stars. The early feedback heats gas to >106 K before cooling it to 104 K. The pressure from this hot gas creates a more extended disc and prevents more star formation prior to z = 1 than supernova feedback alone. The resulting disc galaxy has a flat rotation curve, an exponential surface brightness profile, and matches a wide range of disc scaling relationships. The disc forms from the inside-out with an increasing exponential scale length as the galaxy evolves. Overall, early stellar feedback helps to simulate galaxies that match observational results at low and high redshifts.}},

Our treatment of the inverse Compton scattering includes the effect of anisotropic scattering in the Galactic interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and a new evaluation of the ISRF itself. Models based on locally measured electron and nucleon spectra and synchrotron constraints are consistent with γ-ray measurements in the 30-500 MeV range, but outside this range excesses are apparent. A harder nucleon spectrum is considered but fitting to γ-rays causes it to violate limits from positrons and antiprotons. A harder interstellar electron spectrum allows the γ-ray spectrum to be fitted above 1 GeV as well, and this can be further improved when combined with a modified nucleon spectrum which still respects the limits imposed by antiprotons and positrons. A large electron/inverse Compton halo is proposed which reproduces well the high-latitude variation of γ-ray emission; this is taken as support for the halo size for nucleons deduced from studies of cosmic-ray composition. Halo sizes in the range 4-10 kpc are favored by both analyses. The halo contribution of Galactic emission to the high-latitude γ-ray intensity is large, with implications for the study of the diffuse extragalactic component and signatures of dark matter. The constraints provided by the radio synchrotron spectral index do not allow all of the γ-ray emission at less than 30 MeV to be explained in terms of a steep electron spectrum unless this takes the form of a sharp upturn below 200 MeV. This leads us to prefer a source population as the origin of the excess low-energy γ-rays, which can then be seen as a continuation of the hard X-ray continuum measured by OSSE, Ginga, and RXTE.}},

abstract = {{Aims: Stellar mass distribution in the Andromeda galaxy (M 31) is estimated using optical and near-infrared imaging data. Combining the derived stellar mass model with various kinematical data, properties of the dark matter (DM) halo of the galaxy are constrained. Methods: SDSS observations through the ugriz filters and the Spitzer imaging at 3.6 microns are used to sample the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the galaxy at each imaging pixel. Intrinsic dust extinction effects are taken into account by using far-infrared observations. Synthetic SEDs created with different stellar population synthesis models are fitted to the observed SEDs, providing estimates for the stellar mass surface density at each pixel. The stellar mass distribution of the galaxy is described with a 3-dimensional model consisting of a nucleus, a bulge, a disc, a young disc and a halo component, each following the Einasto density distribution (relations between different functional forms of the Einasto density distribution are given in Appendix B). By comparing the stellar mass distribution to the observed rotation curve and kinematics of outer globular clusters and satellite galaxies, the DM halo parameters are estimated. Results: Stellar population synthesis models suggest that M 31 is dominated by old (≳7 Gyr) stars throughout the galaxy, with the lower limit for the stellar mass-to-light ratios M/Lr ≳ 4 M⊙/L⊙. The upper limit M/Lr ≲ 6 M⊙/L⊙ is given by the rotation curve of the galaxy. The total stellar mass is (10-15) × 1010 M⊙, 30\% of which is in the bulge and 56\% in the disc. None of the tested DM distribution models (Einasto, NFW, Moore, Burkert) can be falsified on the basis of the stellar matter distribution and the rotation curve of the galaxy. The virial mass M200 of the DM halo is (0.8-1.1) × 1012 M⊙ and the virial radius is R200 = 189-213 kpc, depending on the DM distribution. For the Einasto profile, the average density of the DM halo within the central 10 pc is 16-61 M⊙ pc-3 (0.6-2.3 TeV/c2 cm-3), depending on the stellar mass model. The central density of the DM halo is comparable to that of nearby dwarf galaxies, low-surface-brightness galaxies and distant massive disc galaxies, thus the evolution of central DM halo properties seems to be regulated by similar processes for a broad range of halo masses, environments, and cosmological epochs.}},

abstract = {{We present a novel implementation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation, dynamics and accretion in the massively parallel tree+SPH code, ChaNGa. This approach improves the modelling of SMBHs in fully cosmological simulations, allowing for a more detailed analysis of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution throughout cosmic time. Our scheme includes novel, physically motivated models for SMBH formation, dynamics and sinking timescales within galaxies and SMBH accretion of rotationally supported gas. The sub-grid parameters that regulate star formation (SF) and feedback from SMBHs and SNe are optimized against a comprehensive set of z = 0 galaxy scaling relations using a novel, multidimensional parameter search. We have incorporated our new SMBH implementation and parameter optimization into a new set of high-resolution, large-scale cosmological simulations called Romulus. We present initial results from our flagship simulation, Romulus25, showing that our SMBH model results in SF efficiency, SMBH masses and global SF and SMBH accretion histories at high redshift that are consistent with observations. We discuss the importance of SMBH physics in shaping the evolution of massive galaxies and show how SMBH feedback is much more effective at regulating SF compared to SNe feedback in this regime. Further, we show how each aspect of our SMBH model impacts this evolution compared to more common approaches. Finally, we present a science application of this scheme studying the properties and time evolution of an example dual active galactic nucleus system, highlighting how our approach allows simulations to better study galaxy interactions and SMBH mergers in the context of galaxy-BH co-evolution.}},

The simulations include a non-equilibrium chemical network, the gas self-gravity, star formation and supernova feedback. We resolve the structure of the interstellar medium at sub-parsec resolution while also capturing the interaction between the CMZ and the bar-driven large-scale flow out to R ∼ 5 kpc. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The distinction between inner (R ≲ 120 pc) and outer (120 ≲ R ≲ 450 pc) CMZ that is sometimes proposed in the literature is unnecessary. Instead, the CMZ is best described as single structure, namely a star-forming ring with outer radius R ≃ 200 pc which includes the 1.3\&\#9675; complex and which is directly interacting with the dust lanes that mediate the bar-driven inflow. (2) This accretion can induce a significant tilt of the CMZ out of the plane. A tilted CMZ might provide an alternative explanation to the ∞-shaped structure identified in Herschel data by Molinari et al. 2011. (3) The bar in our simulation efficiently drives an inflow from the Galactic disc (R ≃ 3 kpc) down to the CMZ (R ≃ 200 pc) of the order of \$1\textbackslashrm \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslashodot \textbackslash, yr\textasciicircum\{-1\}\$ , consistent with observational determinations. (4) Supernova feedback can drive an inflow from the CMZ inwards towards the circumnuclear disc of the order of \$\textbackslashsim 0.03\textbackslash, \textbackslashrm M\_\textbackslashodot \textbackslash, yr\textasciicircum\{-1\}\$ . (5) We give a new interpretation for the 3D placement of the 20 and 50 km s-1 clouds, according to which they are close (R ≲ 30 pc) to the Galactic centre, but are also connected to the larger-scale streams at R ≳ 100 pc.}},

In this work, we study the properties of this hot X-ray emitting medium using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We analyse their mock X-ray spectra, obtained from the diffuse and metal-enriched gas in TNG100 and TNG50, and compare the results with X-ray observations of nearby early-type galaxies. The simulations reproduce the observed X-ray luminosities (LX) and temperature (TX) at small (<Re) and intermediate (<5Re) radii reasonably well. We find that the X-ray properties of lower mass galaxies depend on their star formation rates. In particular, in the magnitude range where the star-forming and quenched populations overlap, \$M\_\{\textbackslashrm K\}\textbackslashsim -24\textbackslash (M\_*\textbackslashsim 10\textasciicircum\{10.7\}\textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslashodot)\$, we find that the X-ray luminosities of star-forming galaxies are on average about an order of magnitude higher than those of their quenched counterparts. We show that this diversity in LX is a direct manifestation of the quenching mechanism in the simulations, where the galaxies are quenched due to gas expulsion driven by SMBH kinetic feedback. The observed dichotomy in LX is thus an important observable prediction for the SMBH feedback-based quenching mechanisms implemented in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. While the current X-ray observations of star-forming galaxies are broadly consistent with the predictions of the simulations, the observed samples are small and more decisive tests are expected from the sensitive all-sky X-ray survey with eROSITA.}},

Moving beyond spherically symmetric radial profiles, we study the angular dependence of CGM properties around z = 0 massive galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We characterize the angular signal of density, temperature, and metallicity of the CGM as a function of galaxy stellar mass, halo mass, distance, and SMBH mass, via stacking. TNG predicts that the CGM is anisotropic in its thermodynamical properties and chemical content over a large mass range, M* ∼ 1010 − 11.5 M⊙. Along the minor axis directions, gas density is diluted, whereas temperature and metallicity are enhanced. These feedback-induced anisotropies in the CGM have a magnitude of 0.1 − 0.3 dex, extend out to the halo virial radius, and peak at Milky Way-like masses, M* ∼ 1010.8 M⊙. In TNG, this mass scale corresponds to the onset of efficient SMBH feedback and the production of strong outflows. By comparing the anisotropic signals predicted by TNG versus other simulations – Illustris and EAGLE – we find that each simulation produces distinct signatures and mass dependencies, implying that this phenomenon is sensitive to the underlying physical models. Finally, we explore X-ray emission as an observable of this CGM anistropy, finding that future X-ray observations, including the eROSITA all-sky survey, will be able to detect and characterize this signal, particularly in terms of an angular modulation of the X-ray hardness.}},

We examine this topic theoretically using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations and provide insights to the nature of this SMBH – gaseous halo connection. By carrying out a mock X-ray analysis for a mass-selected sample of TNG100 simulated galaxies at \$z\$ = 0, we inspect the relationship between the masses of SMBHs and the hot gas temperatures and luminosities at various spatial and halo scales – from galactic (∼Re) to group/cluster scales (∼R500c). We find strong SMBH-X-ray correlations mostly in quenched galaxies and find that the correlations become stronger and tighter at larger radii. Critically, the X-ray temperature (kBTX) at large radii (r ≳ 5Re) traces the SMBH mass with a remarkably small scatter (∼0.2 dex). The relations emerging from IllustrisTNG are broadly consistent with those obtained from recent X-ray observations. Overall, our analysis suggests that, within the framework of IllustrisTNG, the present-time MBH–kBTX correlations at the high-mass end (MBH ≳ 108M⊙) are fundamentally a reflection of the SMBH mass–halo mass relation, which at such high masses is set by the hierarchical assembly of structures. The exact form, locus, and scatter of those scaling relations are, however, sensitive to feedback processes such as those driven by star formation and SMBH activity.}},

We generate mock images with the properties of the CANDELS survey and derive Sersic parameters and optical rest-frame morphologies as usually done in the observations. Overall, the simulation reproduces the observed evolution of the abundances of different galaxy morphological types of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The log M* − log Re and log M* − log Σ1 relations of the simulated star-forming and quenched galaxies also match the observed slopes and zeropoints to within 1-σ. In the simulation, galaxies increase their observed central stellar mass density (Σ1) and transform in morphology from irregular/clumpy systems to normal Hubble-type systems in the Star Formation Main Sequence at a characteristic stellar mass of ∼1010.5 M⊙ which is reflected in an increase of the central stellar mass density (Σ1). This morphological transformation is connected to the activity of the central Super Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). At low stellar masses (109 < M*/M⊙ < 1010) SMBHs grow rapidly, while at higher mass SMBHs switch into the kinetic feedback mode and grow more slowly. During this low-accretion phase, SMBH feedback leads to the quenching of star-formation, along with a simultaneous growth in Σ1, partly due to the fading of stellar populations. More compact massive galaxies grow their SMBHs faster than extended ones of the same mass and end up quenching earlier. In the TNG50 simulation, SMBHs predominantly grow via gas accretion before galaxies quench, and Σ1 increases substantially after SMBH growth slows down. The simulation predicts therefore that quiescent galaxies have higher Σ1 values than star-forming galaxies for the same SMBH mass, which disagrees with alternative models, and may potentially be in tension with some observations.}},

The two codes share the same Tree‐PM gravity solver and include identical subresolution physics for the treatment of star formation, but employ different methods to solve the equations of hydrodynamics. This allows us to assess the impact of hydro‐solver uncertainties on the results of cosmological studies of galaxy formation. In this paper, we focus on predictions for global baryon statistics, such as the cosmic star formation rate density, after we introduce our simulation suite and numerical methods. Properties of individual galaxies and haloes are examined by Keres et al., while a third paper by Sijacki et al. uses idealized simulations to analyse in more detail the differences between the hydrodynamical schemes. We find that the global baryon statistics differ significantly between the two simulation approaches. arepo shows systematically higher star formation rates at late times, lower mean temperatures averaged over the simulation volume and different gas mass fractions in characteristic phases of the intergalactic medium, in particular a reduced amount of hot gas. Although both hydrodynamical codes use the same implementation of cooling and yield an identical dark matter halo mass function, more gas cools out of haloes in arepo compared with gadget towards low redshifts, which results in corresponding differences in the late‐time star formation rates of galaxies. We show that this difference is caused by a higher heating rate with SPH in the outer parts of haloes, owing to viscous dissipation of SPH's inherent sonic velocity noise and SPH's efficient damping of subsonic turbulence injected in the halo infall region, and because of a higher efficiency of gas stripping in arepo. As a result of such differences, arepo leads also to more disc‐like morphologies in the moving mesh calculation compared to gadget. Our results hence indicate that inaccuracies in hydrodynamic solvers can lead to comparatively large systematic differences even at the level of predictions for the global state of baryons in the universe.}},

Our stellar evolution and chemical enrichment scheme follows nine elements (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe) independently. Stellar feedback is realized through kinetic outflows. The metal mass loading of outflows can be adjusted independently of the wind mass loading. This is required to simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass content of low-mass haloes and their gas oxygen abundances. Radiative EM AGN feedback is implemented assuming an average spectral energy distribution and a luminosity-dependent scaling of obscuration effects. This form of feedback suppresses star formation more efficiently than continuous thermal quasar-mode feedback alone, but is less efficient than mechanical radio-mode feedback in regulating star formation in massive haloes. We contrast simulation predictions for different variants of our galaxy formation model with key observations, allowing us to constrain the importance of different modes of feedback and their uncertain efficiency parameters. We identify a fiducial best match model and show that it reproduces, among other things, the cosmic star formation history, the stellar mass function, the stellar mass–halo mass relation, g-, r-, i- and z-band SDSS galaxy luminosity functions, and the Tully–Fisher relation. We can achieve this success only if we invoke very strong forms of stellar and AGN feedback such that star formation is adequately reduced in both low- and high-mass systems. In particular, the strength of radio-mode feedback needs to be increased significantly compared to previous studies to suppress efficient cooling in massive, metal-enriched haloes.}},

The data may be projected positions, distances, line-of-sight velocities or proper motions. The estimators all assume that the tracer population has a scale-free density and moves in a scale-free potential in the region of interest. The circumstances under which the boundary terms can be discarded and the estimator converges are derived. Forms of the estimator tailored for the Milky Way Galaxy and for M31 are given. Monte Carlo simulations are used to quantify the uncertainty as a function of sample size. For the Milky Way Galaxy, the satellite sample consists of 26 galaxies with line-of-sight velocities. We find that the mass of the Milky Way within 300 kpc is M300 = 0.9 +/- 0.3 × 1012Msolar assuming velocity isotropy. However, the mass estimate is sensitive to the assumed anisotropy and could plausibly lie between 0.7 × 1012 and 3.4 × 1012Msolar, if anisotropies implied by simulations or by the observations are used. Incorporating the proper motions of six Milky Way satellites into the data set, we find M300 = 1.4 +/- 0.3 × 1012Msolar. The range here if plausible anisotropies are used is still broader, from 1.2 × 1012 to 2.7 × 1012Msolar. Note that our error bars only incorporate the statistical uncertainty. There are much greater uncertainties induced by velocity anisotropy and by selection of satellite members. For M31, there are 23 satellite galaxies with measured line-of-sight velocities, but only M33 and IC 10 have proper motions. We use the line-of-sight velocities and distances of the satellite galaxies to estimate the mass of M31 within 300 kpc as M300 = 1.4 +/- 0.4 × 1012Msolar assuming isotropy. There is only a modest dependence on anisotropy, with the mass varying between 1.3 × 1012 and 1.6 × 1012Msolar. Incorporating the proper motion data set does not change the results significantly. Given the uncertainties, we conclude that the satellite data by themselves yield no reliable insights into which of the two galaxies is actually the more massive. Leo I has long been known to dominate mass estimates for the Milky Way due to its substantial distance and line-of-sight velocity. We find that And XII and And XIV similarly dominate the estimated mass of M31. As such, we repeat the calculations without these galaxies, in case they are not bound - although on the balance of the evidence, we favour their inclusion in mass calculations.}},

This version contains a finite-volume magnetohydrodynamics algorithm on an unstructured, dynamic Voronoi tessellation coupled to a tree-particle-mesh algorithm for the Poisson equation either on a Newtonian or cosmologically expanding spacetime. Time-integration is performed adopting local timestep constraints for each cell individually, solving the fluxes only across active interfaces, and calculating gravitational forces only between active particles, using an operator-splitting approach. This allows simulations with high dynamic range to be performed efficiently. Arepo is a massively distributed-memory parallel code, using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication standard and employing a dynamical work-load and memory balancing scheme to allow optimal use of multi-node parallel computers. The employed parallelization algorithms of Arepo are deterministic and produce binary-identical results when re-run on the same machine and with the same number of MPI ranks. A simple primordial cooling and star formation model is included as an example of sub-resolution models commonly used in simulations of galaxy formation. Arepo also contains a suite of computationally inexpensive test problems, ranging from idealized tests for automated code verification to scaled-down versions of cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and is extensively documented in order to assist adoption of the code by new scientific users.}},

abstract = {{We study the population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their effects on massive central galaxies in the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The employed model for SMBH growth and feedback assumes a two-mode scenario in which the feedback from active galactic nuclei occurs through a kinetic, comparatively efficient mode at low accretion rates relative to the Eddington limit, and in the form of a thermal, less efficient mode at high accretion rates. We show that the quenching of massive central galaxies happens coincidently with kinetic-mode feedback, consistent with the notion that active supermassive black cause the low specific star formation rates observed in massive galaxies. However, major galaxy mergers are not responsible for initiating most of the quenching events in our model. Up to black hole masses of about \$10\textasciicircum\{8.5\}\textbackslash,\{\textbackslashrm M\}\_\textbackslashodot\$, the dominant growth channel for SMBHs is in the thermal mode. Higher mass black holes stay mainly in the kinetic mode and gas accretion is self-regulated via their feedback, which causes their Eddington ratios to drop, with SMBH mergers becoming the main channel for residual mass growth. As a consequence, the quasar luminosity function is dominated by rapidly accreting, moderately massive black holes in the thermal mode. We show that the associated growth history of SMBHs produces a low-redshift quasar luminosity function and a redshift zero black hole mass-stellar bulge mass relation in good agreement with observations, whereas the simulation tends to over-predict the high-redshift quasar luminosity function.}},

abstract = {{The inefficiency of star formation in massive elliptical galaxies is widely believed to be caused by the interactions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with the surrounding gas. Achieving a sufficiently rapid reddening of moderately massive galaxies without expelling too many baryons has however proven difficult for hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, prompting us to explore a new model for the accretion and feedback effects of supermassive black holes. For high accretion rates relative to the Eddington limit, we assume that a fraction of the accreted rest mass energy heats the surrounding gas thermally, similar to the `quasar mode' in previous work. For low accretion rates, we invoke a new, pure kinetic feedback model which imparts momentum into the surrounding gas in a stochastic manner. These two modes of feedback are motivated both by theoretical conjectures for the existence of different types of accretion flows as well as recent observational evidence for the importance of kinetic AGN winds in quenching galaxies. We find that a large fraction of the injected kinetic energy in this mode thermalises via shocks in the surrounding gas, thereby providing a distributed heating channel. In cosmological simulations, the resulting model produces red, non star-forming massive elliptical galaxies, and achieves realistic gas fractions, black hole growth histories and thermodynamic profiles in large haloes.}},

Combined with constraints on the evolution of the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation over galaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmic time, the majority of stars formed in disks.

IMBHs originally located at the centre of dwarfs that later collide with the Milky Way (MW) could be wandering, undetected, in our Galaxy. We used TNG50, the highest resolution run of the IllustrisTNG project, to study the kinematics and dynamics of star clusters, in the appropriate mass range, acting as IMBH proxies in an MW analogue galaxy. We showed that \$\textbackslashsim 87\{\{\textbackslash \textbackslashrm per\textbackslash cent\}\}\$ of our studied IMBHs drift inward. The radial velocity of these sinking IMBHs has a median magnitude of \$\textbackslashsim 0.44 \textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{ckpc \textbackslash, h\textasciicircum\{-1\} \textbackslash, Gyr\textasciicircum\{-1\}\}\$ and no dependence on the black hole mass. The central \$1 \textbackslash, \textbackslashrm ckpc \textbackslash, h\textasciicircum\{-1\}\$ has the highest number density of IMBHs in the galaxy. A physical toy model with linear drag forces was developed to explain the orbital circularization with time. These findings constrain the spatial distribution of IMBHs, suggesting that future searches should focus on the central regions of the Galaxy. Additionally, we found that the 3D velocity distribution of IMBHs with respect to the galactic centre has a mean of \$\textbackslashsim 180 \textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{km \textbackslash, s\textasciicircum\{-1\}\}\$ and larger variance with decreasing radius. Remarkably, the velocity distribution relative to the local gas shows significantly lower values, with a mean of \$\textbackslashsim 88 \textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{km \textbackslash, s\textasciicircum\{-1\}\}\$. These results are instrumental for predicting the accretion and radiation properties of IMBHs, facilitating their detection with future surveys.}},

abstract = {{Low-mass “dwarf” galaxies represent the most significant challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model of cosmological structure formation. Because these faint galaxies are (best) observed within the Local Group (LG) of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31), understanding their formation in such an environment is critical. We present first results from the Latte Project: the Milky Way on Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE). This simulation models the formation of an MW-mass galaxy to z=0 within ΛCDM cosmology, including dark matter, gas, and stars at unprecedented resolution: baryon particle mass of 7070 \{M\}⊙ with gas kernel/softening that adapts down to 1 \{pc\} (with a median of 25\{--\}60 \{pc\} at z=0). Latte was simulated using the GIZMO code with a mesh-free method for accurate hydrodynamics and the FIRE-2 model for star formation and explicit feedback within a multi-phase interstellar medium. For the first time, Latte self-consistently resolves the spatial scales corresponding to half-light radii of dwarf galaxies that form around an MW-mass host down to \{M\}\{star\}≳ \{10\}5 \{M\}⊙ . Latte’s population of dwarf galaxies agrees with the LG across a broad range of properties: (1) distributions of stellar masses and stellar velocity dispersions (dynamical masses), including their joint relation; (2) the mass-metallicity relation; and (3) diverse range of star formation histories, including their mass dependence. Thus, Latte produces a realistic population of dwarf galaxies at \{M\}\{star\}≳ \{10\}5 \{M\}⊙ that does not suffer from the “missing satellites” or “too big to fail” problems of small-scale structure formation. We conclude that baryonic physics can reconcile observed dwarf galaxies with standard ΛCDM cosmology.}},

The distances, mean reddening values, and age distributions of the stars in these regions were measured using the routines of Dolphin. Independent measurements of overlapping fields show that the results are stable for most samples. A slight distance gradient is seen across the major axis of the southern disk, and a mean distance of 24.47 ± 0.03 is found by combining the results. Higher mean reddening values are seen to follow the spiral structure. The stellar age distributions are consistent with episodic star formation confined mainly to the gas-rich arm regions. If these episodes were caused by propagating density waves, the waves did not cause significant star formation episodes in the gas-poor interarm regions. A combination of all of the results provides the total star formation rate for 1.4 deg2 of the M31 disk for six epochs. These results suggest that star formation in the disk declined by ∼50\% from ∼250 to ∼50 Myr ago. The lowest star formation rate occurred ∼25 Myr ago, followed by a ∼20\% increase to the present. The mean star formation rate for this large portion of M31 over the past 60 Myr is 0.63 ± 0.07 M⊙ yr-1, suggesting a total mean rate for the disk of ∼1 M⊙ yr-1.}},

A comparison with other algorithms presented in the literature yields overall good agreement, with mordor displaying a higher flexibility in correctly decomposing systems and identifying bars in crowded environments (e.g. with ongoing fly-bys, often observable in cosmological simulations).

The agreement between the morphology of simulated and real galaxies, and the way the morphological types are distributed across galaxy scaling relations are important probes of our knowledge of galaxy formation physics. Here, we propose an unsupervised deep learning approach to perform a stringent test of the fine morphological structure of galaxies coming from the Illustris and IllustrisTNG (TNG100 and TNG50) simulations against observations from a subsample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our framework is based on PixelCNN, an autoregressive model for image generation with an explicit likelihood. We adopt a strategy that combines the output of two PixelCNN networks in a metric that isolates the small-scale morphological details of galaxies from the sky background. We are able to quantitatively identify the improvements of IllustrisTNG, particularly in the high-resolution TNG50 run, over the original Illustris. However, we find that the fine details of galaxy structure are still different between observed and simulated galaxies. This difference is mostly driven by small, more spheroidal, and quenched galaxies that are globally less accurate regardless of resolution and which have experienced little improvement between the three simulations explored. We speculate that this disagreement, that is less severe for quenched discy galaxies, may stem from a still too coarse numerical resolution, which struggles to properly capture the inner, dense regions of quenched spheroidal galaxies.}},

When the bars were formed, the disc gas fractions were mostly lower than 0.4. The much higher bar fraction in TNG100 probably have benefit from much lower gas fraction in massive disc galaxies since \$z\textbackslashsim3\$, which may result from the combination of more effective stellar and AGN feedback. The latter may be the primary factor at \$z<2\$. Meanwhile, in both simulations, barred galaxies have higher star formation rate before bar formation, and stronger AGN feedback all the time than unbarred galaxies. The properties of dark matter halos hosting massive disc galaxies are similar between two simulations, and should have minor effect on the different bar frequency. For individual galaxies under similar halo environment cross two simulations, different baryonic physics can lead to striking discrepancy on morphology. The morphology of individual galaxies is subject to combined effects of environment and internal baryonic physics, and is often not predictable.}},

abstract = {{Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) which reside at the centres of galaxies can inject vast amounts of energy into the surrounding gas and are thought to be a viable mechanism to quench star-formation in massive galaxies. Here we study the \$10\textasciicircum\{\textbackslashrm 9-12.5\}\textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{M\_\textbackslashodot \}\$ stellar mass central galaxy population of the IllustrisTNG simulation, specifically the TNG100 and TNG300 volumes at z = 0, and show how the three components - SMBH, galaxy, and circumgalactic medium (CGM) - are interconnected in their evolution. We find that gas entropy is a sensitive diagnostic of feedback injection. In particular, we demonstrate how the onset of the low-accretion BH feedback mode, realised in the IllustrisTNG model as a kinetic, BH-driven wind, leads not only to star-formation quenching at stellar masses ≳ 1010.5 M⊙ but also to a change in thermodynamic properties of the (non-star-forming) gas, both within the galaxy and beyond. The IllustrisTNG kinetic feedback from SMBHs increases the average gas entropy, within the galaxy and in the CGM, lengthening typical gas cooling times from \$\textbackslashrm 10-100\textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{Myr\}\$ to \$\textbackslashrm 1-10\textbackslash, \textbackslashmathrm\{Gyr\}\$ , effectively ceasing ongoing star-formation and inhibiting radiative cooling and future gas accretion. In practice, the same AGN feedback channel is simultaneously 'ejective' and 'preventative' and leaves an imprint on the temperature, density, entropy, and cooling times also in the outer reaches of the gas halo, up to distances of several hundred kiloparsecs. In the IllustrisTNG model, a long-lasting quenching state can occur for a heterogeneous CGM, whereby the hot and dilute CGM gas of quiescent galaxies contains regions of low-entropy gas with short cooling times.}},

abstract = {{Elongated, bar-like galaxies without a significant disk component, with little rotation support and no gas, often form as a result of tidal interactions with a galaxy cluster, as was recently demonstrated using the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation. Galaxies that exhibit similar properties are, however, also found to be infalling into the cluster for the first time. We use the same simulation to study in detail the history of such a galaxy over cosmic time in order to determine its origin. The bar appears to be triggered at t = 6.8 Gyr by the combined effect of the last significant merger with a subhalo and the first passage of another dwarf satellite, both ten times less massive than the galaxy. The satellites deposit all their gas in the galaxy, contributing to its third and last star-formation episode, which perturbs the disk and may also contribute to the formation of the bar. The galaxy then starts to lose its gas and dark matter due to its passage near a group of more massive galaxies. The strongest interaction involves a galaxy 22 times more massive, leaving the barred galaxy with no gas and half of its maximum dark matter mass. During this time, the bar grows steadily, seemingly unaffected by the interactions, although they may have aided its growth by stripping the gas. The studied galaxy, together with two other similar objects briefly discussed in this Letter, suggest the existence of a new class of early-type barred galaxies and thereby demonstrate the importance of interactions in galaxy formation and evolution.}},

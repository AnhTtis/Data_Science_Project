    "abstract": "Coexistence of ferromagnetism, piezoelectricity and valley in two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial to advance multifunctional electronic technologies. Here, Janus ScXY (X$\\neq$Y=Cl, Br and I) monolayers are predicted to be in-plane piezoelectric ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors with dynamical, mechanical and thermal stabilities. The predicted piezoelectric strain coefficients $d_{11}$ and $d_{31}$ (absolute values) are higher than ones of most 2D materials. Moreover, the $d_{31}$ (absolute value) of ScClI reaches up to 1.14 pm/V, which is highly desirable for ultrathin piezoelectric device application. To obtain spontaneous valley polarization, charge doping are explored to tune the direction of magnetization of ScXY. By appropriate hole doping, their easy magnetization axis can change from in-plane to out-of-plane, resulting in spontaneous valley polarization. Taking ScBrI with 0.20 holes per f.u. as a example, under the action of an in-plane electric field, the hole carriers of K valley turn towards one edge of the sample, which will produce anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE), and the hole carriers of $Γ$ valley move in a straight line. These findings could pave the way for designing piezoelectric and valleytronic devices.",

To test the convergence of Carleman truncation error as a function of the
truncation order, we perform LBM-D1Q3 with a single node and periodic boundary
conditions. We use a single node because the Carleman linearization is only
applied to the collision term. All simulations are initiated with an arbitrary initial
velocity.
The time step $dt=\tau/10$ is used for all
the simulations. The relative error ($\epsilon^{\rm CLBM}_m = |f^{\rm CLBM}_m -
f_m|/ f_m$) is on the order of $10^{-14}$ for the truncation order $k=3$ and on the order of
$10^{-15}$ for $k \ge 4$ (\Fig{fig:CLBM_collision_error}), which are close to the machine error. 
This numerically confirms our conclusion that the Carleman truncation error converges at order $k=3$ when Carleman linearing the LBE (\Eq{eq:LBMs}) for weakly compressible flow ($\text{Ma} \ll 1$). The close-to-machine-error $\epsilon_m^{\text{CLBM}}$ also suggests that the truncated CLBM can hardly be distinguished from the infinite CLBM (real solution) until $1/\epsilon_m^{\text{CLBM}}$. 
This remarkably low Carleman truncation error is particularly favourable to QLSA and paves our way to confidently apply QLSA to the Carleman-linearized LBE (\Eq{eq:clbm}).

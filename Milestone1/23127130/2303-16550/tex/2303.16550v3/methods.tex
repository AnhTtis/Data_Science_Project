\subsection{Navier--Stokes equations and their lattice Boltzmann form}

The Navier--Stokes equations (NSE) governing fluid dynamics read
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \bm{u}}{\partial t} + \bm{u}\cdot(\bm{\nabla u})  =
  -\frac{{\bm{\nabla}} p}{\rho}
  + \nu \nabla^2 \bm{u},
\label{turb}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:continuity}
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + {\bm{\nabla}}\cdot(\rho\bm{u}) = 0 ,
\end{equation}
where $\bm{u}$ is the flow velocity,  
$p$ is the pressure, $\rho$ is the fluid
density, and $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. 
The nonlinearity of \Eq{turb} is exhibited in  $\bm{u}\cdot(\bm{\nabla u})$.
This term and the viscosity term $\nu \nabla^2\bm{ u}$ together determine the multiscale property of nonlinear fluid dynamics characterized by the Reynolds number $\text{Re} =
\bm{u}\cdot(\bm{\nabla u})/(\nu \nabla^2\bm{u})$.
Turbulent flow systems in nature are often characterized by high
$\text{Re}$ (e.g., $\text{Re}\approx 10^7$ for atmospheric flows and
$\text{Re}\approx 10^{21}$ for astrophysical flows), which are intractable
to simulate using classical computers, as the best-case computational cost
scales as $\text{Re}^3$ in space and time according to the Kolmogorov
theory\citep{pope2000turbulent}. The compressibility of the flow is
characterized by the Mach number $\text{Ma}=\vert \bm{u} \vert/c_s$ with $c_s$
being the speed of sound.

solve the lattice Boltzmann
  form of the NSE to reduce the nonlinearity from
  Re-determined $\bm{u}\cdot(\bm{\nabla u})$ to Ma-determined
  $u^2=\vec{u}\cdot\vec{u}$. The discrete-velocity Boltzmann form of \Eq{turb} with Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook (BGK)
collision \cite{Bhatnagar1954ASystems} leads to:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lbm_origin}
\frac{\partial\tilde{f}_m}{\partial\tilde t} +\tilde{\vec{e}}_m \cdot
\tilde{\bm{\nabla}} \tilde{f}_m = -\frac{1}{\tilde\tau}
\left(\tilde{f}_m-\tilde{f}_m^{\rm eq}\right),\quad m \in 1, \dots, Q,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{f}_m(\tilde{\bm{x}}, \tilde{t})$ is the particle velocity distribution function
describing the probability density of finding a particle around position
$\tilde{\bm{x}}$ at time $\tilde{t}$ with unit discrete velocity
$\tilde{\bm{e}}_m$, and $Q$ is the number of discrete velocities
\citep{Chen1998LatticeFlows}.  If a spatial discretization uses $n$
grid points, the dimensionality of $f$ is $n\times Q$; as we will
discuss below, $Q$ is a fixed, small number ($Q\leq 27$ in widespread
practice), whereas simulations with large domains or fine resolutions
are often desirable, resulting in $n\gg 1$. In our complexity analysis, we
therefore treat $Q$ as a constant and $n$ as a parameter of the
problem whose effects in the large-$n$ limit are of particular
practical interest.
In one, two, and three dimensions, the square or cubic lattices D1Q3,
D2Q9, and D3Q27 are in widespread use \cite{Chen1998LatticeFlows}.
$\tilde{f}^{\rm{eq}}_{m}$ is the local Maxwell equilibrium
that $\tilde{f}_m(\bm{x}, t)$ relaxes to at a single relaxation time of $\tilde{\tau}$. 
$\tilde{\bm{\nabla}}$ represents the spatial gradient
in the $\tilde{x}$, $\tilde{y}$, and $\tilde{z}$ directions. By using a reference
density $\rho_r$ and speed $e_r$, characteristic macroscopic length scale $L$,
and particle collision $t_c$, one obtains the nondimensional form of
\Eq{eq:lbm_origin}, termed the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE):
\begin{equation}
\partial_t f_m+\bm{e}_m \cdot \bm{\nabla} f_m = -\frac{1}{\tau\, \kn} (f_m-f_m^{\rm eq}), \quad m = 1, \dots, Q,
\label{eq:LBMs}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
  f_m &= \tilde{f}_m/\rho_r, \\
  \feq_m &= \tilde{f}^{\rm{eq}}_m/\rho_r,  \\
  \label{eq:scale-t}
  t &= \tilde{t}/(L/e_r), \\
  \vec{e} &= \tilde{\vec{e}}/e_r, \\
  \label{eq:scale-x}
  \nabla &= L\tilde\nabla, \text{ and} \\
  \tau &= \tilde\tau/t_c. 
\end{align}
(To minimize clutter in the following, variables without tilde are
nondimensional, and variables with tilde are their dimensional physical counterparts.)
The Knudsen number describing the ratio of collision time to flow time is defined as 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:epsilon}
  \kn=e_r \frac{t_c}L 
\end{equation}
 and forms the basis for the Chapman--Enskog expansion
\cite{Chen1998LatticeFlows} of the LBE, which recovers the
NSE in the limit $\kn\ll 1$.
The macroscopic fluid density $\rho(\bm{x}, t)$ is retrieved as
\begin{equation}
    \rho(\bm{x}, t)=\sum_{m=1}^Q f_m(\bm{x},t)
\label{eq:rho}
\end{equation}
and the macroscopic fluid velocity as 
\begin{equation}
    \bm{u}(\bm{x}, t)=\frac 1 \rho \sum_{m=1}^Q f_m(\bm{x},t)\bm{e}_m.
\label{eq:u}
\end{equation}
To recover the NSE from \Eq{eq:LBMs}, the equilibrium
distribution function $f_m(\bm{x}, t)$ is chosen as the Taylor
expansion of the Maxwell distribution function:
\begin{equation}
\feq_m = \rho w_m[a+b{\bm e}_m\cdot {\bm u}+c({\bm e_m}\cdot{\bm u})^2+d\vert{\bm u}\vert^2];
\label{eq:feq}
\end{equation}
quadratic degree enables the LBE to reproduce the quadratic NSE to $O(\ma^2)$, and the
constants $a=1$, $b=3$, $c=9/2$, and $d=-3/2$ are the Taylor coefficients \cite{Chen1998LatticeFlows}.

Constants $a$ through $d$ are all $O(1)$ quantities as, in the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), they are
proportional to the powers of the speed of sound, which is $O(1)$ due to
the velocity rescaling. The lattice constants $w_1,\dots, w_Q$ provide
the Maxwell weighting of the different discrete velocities $\vec
e_1,\dots,\vec e_Q$ (which are not necessarily unit vectors) and satisfy
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:wm}
\sum_m w_m = 1.
\end{equation}
The lattice constants depend on the dimension $D
\in \{1,2,3\}$ of the simulation and the number $Q$ of discrete velocities used. 
As the speed of sound is $O(1)$, the macroscopic
velocity $\vert \vec u \vert = O(\text{Ma})$, i.e., $\vert \vec u \vert \ll 1$ in weakly
compressible applications. 
Compared to the incompressible NSE ($\text{Ma}=0$), the Chapman-Enskog expansion of LBE leads to an additional ``compressibility error'' of $O(\ma^2)$ as proved in \citet{Sterling95}.
We remark that the LBM is suitable for high Reynolds number flow since the condition of $\text{Kn}=O\text{(Ma/Re)}$ can be well met \citep{Toschi05} with $\text{Re}\gg 1$ (e.g., $\text{Kn} = O(10^{-9})$ considering $\ma \approx 10^{-1}$ and $\re \approx 10^8$ in the Earth atmosphere). This feature of LBM is crucial for the complexity analysis discussed below.

\subsection{Carleman linearization of the lattice Boltzmann equation}

The LBE (\Eq{eq:LBMs}) contains terms that are nonlinear in $f$
due to the presence of the $\rho u^2$ terms in $\feq_m$ (i.e., \Eq{eq:feq}).  These nonlinear terms
involve the ratio of quadratic combinations of $f_m$ in the numerator and linear
combinations of $f_m$ in the denominator.  Because the deviation of the
denominator (macroscopic density $\rho$) from 1 is small ($\rho \approx 1$) in weakly
compressible flow, we can approximate $1/\rho$ to first-order Taylor expansion as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rhotaylor}
  \frac 1 \rho \approx 2 - \rho, \quad \lvert 1 - \rho \rvert \ll 1
\end{equation}
with $O(\ma^4)$ error; this is acceptable, since the LBE recovers NSE
to $O(\ma^2)$.  Substituting the expansion of $1/\rho$ yields
polynomial combinations of $f_m$ up to cubic degree in 
$\feq_m$.  Cubic degree is therefore the minimum usable Carleman
degree that can recover NSE when $\text{Ma}\ll1$.

We collect the terms of different polynomial degree in \Eq{eq:LBMs} after the expansion of  \Eq{eq:feq}, with linear terms on the first, quadratic on
the second, and cubic terms on the third lines:
\begin{align}
  \ddt{f_m} = 
  &-\vec{e}_m\cdot\nabla f_m - \frac{1}{\kn\tau}f_m +
  \frac 1{\kn\tau} w_m \left[a\sum_{n=1}^Q f_n + b \vec{e}_m \cdot \sum_{n=1}^Q \vec{e}_nf_n
  \right] \nonumber \\
  & + \frac 2 {\kn\tau} w_m \left[c\left(\vec{e}_m\cdot\sum_{n=1}^Q \vec{e}_n f_n\right)^2 +
    d\left(\sum_{n=1}^Q \vec{e}_n f_n\right)^2\right] \nonumber \\
  \label{eq:lbm-grouped}
  & - \frac 1 {\kn\tau} w_m \left[\sum_{n=1}^Qf_n\right]\left[c\left(\vec{e}_m\cdot\sum_{n=1}^Q \vec{e}_n f_n\right)^2 +
    d\left(\sum_{n=1}^Q \vec{e}_n f_n\right)^2\right]
\end{align}
In the following, we adopt the \citet{Forets2017} notation and separate the
linear, quadratic, and cubic terms into products of constant coefficient matrices
$F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$ and 1-, 2-, and 3-forms. Note that we will treat the streaming
operator
\begin{equation}
  Sf=\vec{e}_m\cdot\nabla f_m
\end{equation}
separately for reasons that will become apparent in the discussion of $n$-point
grids.  We write
\Eq{eq:lbm-grouped} as 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lbm-carleman}
  \ddt{f} = -Sf + F^{(1)}f + F^{(2)} f^{[2]} + F^{(3)} f^{[3]},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
f = (f_1, \dots, f_Q)^\trans;\label{eq:def-f}
\end{equation}
the superscript $^{[k]}$ denotes Kronecker
exponentiation:
\begin{equation}
  f^{[k]} = \underset{k \text{ times}}{\underbrace{f\otimes \cdots \otimes f}}
\end{equation}
$f^{[k]}$ is the $Q^k$-length vector of polynomial permutations
of $f_m$ of degree $k$, including terms that are degenerate because of
commutativity under multiplication. The Kronecker product operator $\otimes$
acts on vectors
\begin{equation}
  x\otimes y = (x_1 y_1, x_1 y_2,\ldots, x_1 y_m, x_2 y_1,\ldots,x_2 y_m, \ldots, x_n y_1,\ldots, x_n y_m)^\trans
\end{equation}
and matrices
\begin{equation}
  A \otimes B = \begin{pmatrix}
    a_{11}B &\ldots&a_{1n}B \\
    \vdots & & \vdots \\
    a_{m1}B & \ldots &a_{mn}B 
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
by forming all product permutations of their elements.  $F^{(k)}$ is a
$Q\times Q^k$ matrix of constant coefficients of the polynomial combinations of
$f_m$.  The procedure of Carleman linearization
\citep{Carleman1932} recasts this system of $Q$ polynomial differential
equations as an infinite system of coupled linear differential equations by
treating $f^{[k]}$ as new degrees of freedom whose time derivatives are
determined from \Eq{eq:lbm-carleman} by the Leibniz product rule.  Denoting
\begin{equation}
  V^{(k)} = (f, f^{[2]}, \dots, f^{[k]})^\trans,
\end{equation}
the infinite-dimensional Carleman form of \Eq{eq:lbm-carleman} reads
\begin{equation}
  \ddt{V^{(\infty)}} = C^{(\infty)} V^{(\infty)},
  \label{eq:cv}
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
C^{(\infty)} = \begin{pmatrix}
A_1^1 & A_2^1 & A_3^1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots \\ 
0 & A_2^2 & A_3^2 & A_4^2 & 0 & 0 & \ldots \\
0 & 0 & A_3^3 & A_4^3 & A_5^3 & 0 & \ldots \\   
\vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots  & \vdots &\vdots & \ddots &\\
\end{pmatrix} \label{eq:Cinfdef}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{align}
A^i_{i+j-1} = \sum_{r=1}^i \overset{i \text{ factors}}{\overbrace{\IdQ \otimes \cdots \otimes \underset{\underset{r\text{th position}}{\uparrow}}{F^{(j)}} \otimes  \cdots  \otimes \IdQ }}. \label{eq:defiBij}
\end{align}
$\IdQ$ is the identity matrix; 
a proof is given in \citet{Forets2017}.  The truncated Carleman
  linearization simply terminates the series at degree $k$, neglecting all
terms of degree $k+1$ and higher:
\begin{equation}
C^{(k)} = \begin{pmatrix}
A_1^1 & A_2^1 & A_3^1 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & A_2^2 & A_3^2 & A_4^2 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & A_{k-2}^{k-2} & A_{k-1}^{k-2} & A_{k}^{k-2} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & A_{k-1}^{k-1} & A_k^{k-1} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & A_k^k  \\
\end{pmatrix} \label{eq:Cdef}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Carleman-linearized LBE on spatial discretization grids}

To describe a spatially discretized system with $n$ grid points, we
introduce the following notation.  Greek letters are used to index grid points
(e.g., $\vec{x}_\alpha$, $\alpha\in 1,\dots,n$), to prevent confusion with the
(italic) indices of discrete velocities.  In place of the single-point objects
$f$, $V$, $A$, $F$, and $C$, we use $\phi$, $\mathcal{V}$, $\mathcal{A}$,
$\mathcal{F}$, and $\mathcal{C}$ to denote their $n$-point counterparts.

The distribution functions $f_m(\vec{x}_\alpha)$ at each grid point
are arranged into an $nQ$-length vector
\begin{align}
  \phi(\vec{x}) &= (f(\vec{x_1}), \dots, f(\vec{x_n}))^\trans \nonumber \\
  &= (f_1(\vec{x}_1), \dots, f_Q(\vec{x}_1), f_1(\vec{x}_2), \dots,
  f_Q(\vec{x}_2), \dots, f_1(\vec{x}_n), \dots, f_Q(\vec{x}_n))^\trans.
\end{align}
The $k$-forms $\phi^{[k]}(\vec x)$, then, include both local and nonlocal terms, i.e., products of
distribution functions at different positions.  While the streaming operator $S$ in
\Eq{eq:lbm-carleman}, implemented as finite differences, connects
distribution functions at different locations,  the collision operator is purely
local.  Thus, the $n$-point versions of
$F^{(1)}$, $F^{(2)}$, and $F^{(3)}$ are $n$-fold block repetitions of the single-point
versions; define
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:F_i_alpha}
  \mathcal F^{(i)}(\vec{x}_\alpha) =  \delta_\alpha^{[i]} \otimes F^{(i)},
\end{equation}
where the local nature of the collision operator is expressed by the vector 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:delta-alpha}
  \delta_\alpha = (\underset{n \text{ elements}}{\underbrace{0, \dots,
      \overset{\alpha\text{th position}}{\overbrace 1}, \dots, 0}}).
\end{equation}
Further define
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:F_i_n}
  \mathcal F^{(i)}(\vec{x}) = (\mathcal F^{(i)}(\vec{x}_1), \dots, \mathcal F^{(i)}(\vec{x}_n)).
\end{equation}
It follows from \Eq{eq:F_i_alpha} that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:diagonality-F}
  \mathcal F^{(i)}(\vec x_\alpha) [\underset{i \text{ factors}}{\underbrace{f(\vec x_\beta)
    \otimes \dots \otimes f(\vec x_\gamma)}}] = F^{(i)} f^{[i]}(\vec x_\alpha) \delta_{\alpha\beta}\dots\delta_{\alpha\gamma},
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{\alpha\beta}$ is the Kronecker delta function.
In other words, products of the form
$\mathcal F^{(i)}(\vec{x})\phi^{[i]}(\vec{x})$ only involve operations on
individual grid points even though the $\mathcal F^{(i)}(\vec x)$ matrices and
$\phi(\vec x)$ vector span all $n$ grid points.  We will refer to this property as
diagonality in $\vec x$.

Analogous to \Eq{eq:lbm-carleman}, the $n$-point LBE is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eq:lbm-carleman-n}
  \ddt{\phi(\vec x)} = -S\phi(\vec x) + \mathcal F^{(1)}(\vec x)\phi(\vec x) +
  \mathcal F^{(2)}(\vec x)\phi^{[2]}(\vec x) + \mathcal F^{(3)}(\vec x)\phi^{[3]}(\vec x).
\end{equation}
The $n$-point Carleman matrix involves $n$-point versions of the transfer
matrices $A^i_j$; these are obtained by inserting
\Eq{eq:F_i_n} into the $n$-point equivalent of \Eq{eq:defiBij}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nptAij}
  \mathcal A^i_{i+j-1}(\vec x) =
  \sum_{r=1}^i \overset{i \text{ factors}}{\overbrace{
      \IdnQ \otimes \cdots \otimes
      \underset{\underset{r\text{th position}}{\uparrow}}{\mathcal F^{(j)}(\vec x)}
      \otimes  \cdots  \otimes \IdnQ }}. 
\end{equation}
It follows from \Eq{eq:diagonality-F} that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:diagonality-A}
  \mathcal A^i_{i+j-1}(\vec x_\alpha) [\underset{i+j-1 \text{ factors}}
  {\underbrace{f(\vec x_\beta) \otimes \dots \otimes f(\vec x_\gamma)}}] =
  A^i_{i+j-1} f^{[i]}(\vec x_\alpha)\delta_{\alpha\beta}\dots\delta_{\alpha\gamma}.
\end{equation}
Thus, $\mathcal A^i_{i+j-1}(\vec x_\alpha)$ is also diagonal in $\vec x$.

The streaming operator can be implemented as finite differences between
neighboring points (not necessarily restricted to nearest neighbors if better
than second-order accuracy is desired, but $O(Q)$ for any reasonable finite
difference implementation).  This results in a matrix form for $S$ with
$O(Q)$ off-diagonal bands, and transfer matrices that are obtained from
\Eq{eq:nptAij} by inserting $S$ instead of $\mathcal F^{(1)}$.  We denote
these transfer matrices of $S$ as $\mathcal B^i_i$; since
$S\phi(\vec{x})$ is linear in $\phi(\vec{x})$, $\mathcal B$ only enters on the block diagonal
of $\mathcal C(\vec{x})$.  (Note that, while $\mathcal B$ is diagonal in
Carleman degree, it is not diagonal in $\vec x$.)

The sum of the streaming Carleman matrix

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:npt-stream}
  \mathcal C_s^{(k)}(\vec x) = - \begin{pmatrix}
    \mathcal B_1^1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
    0 & \mathcal B_2^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & \mathcal B_{k-2}^{k-2} & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & \mathcal B_{k-1}^{k-1} & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & \mathcal B_k^k  \\
  \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}
and the collision-term $n$-point Carleman matrix
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:npt-coll}
  \mathcal C_c^{(k)}(\vec x) = \begin{pmatrix}
    \mathcal A_1^1(\vec x) & \mathcal A_2^1(\vec x) & \mathcal A_3^1(\vec x) & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
    0 & \mathcal A_2^2(\vec x) & \mathcal A_3^2(\vec x) & \mathcal A_4^2(\vec x) & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots &  \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & \mathcal A_{k-2}^{k-2}(\vec x) & \mathcal A_{k-1}^{k-2}(\vec x) & \mathcal A_{k}^{k-2}(\vec x) \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & \mathcal A_{k-1}^{k-1}(\vec x) & \mathcal A_k^{k-1}(\vec x) \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & \mathcal A_k^k(\vec x)  
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
then yields the $n$-point truncated Carleman matrix at degree $k$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:n_point_Carleman}
  \mathcal C^{(k)}(\vec x) = \mathcal C_s^{(k)}(\vec x) + \mathcal C_c^{(k)}(\vec x).
\end{equation}
Similarly, the $n$-point Carleman vector becomes
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal V^{(k)}(\vec x) = (\phi(\vec x), \phi^{[2]}(\vec x), \dots,
  \phi^{[k]}(\vec x))^\trans,
\end{equation}
leading to the Carleman-linearized truncated LBE over $n$ grid points:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \mathcal V^{(k)}(\vec x)}{\partial t} = \mathcal C^{(k)}(\vec x)
  \mathcal V^{(k)}(\vec x),
  \label{eq:clbm}
\end{equation}
which, like the single-point Carleman LBE, is a system of linear differential
equations in matrix form.  In contrast to the single-point Carleman vector
$V^{(k)}$, which has dimension $\sum_{i=1}^k Q^i$, the dimension of the $n$-point Carleman vector
$\mathcal V^{(k)}(\vec x)$ is $\sum_{i=1}^k n^iQ^i$.  Note that $\mathcal
C_c^{(k)}(\vec x)$, all its transfer-matrix blocks being diagonal in $\vec x$ by
\Eq{eq:diagonality-A}, is also diagonal in $\vec x$, a property we will use
extensively in the quantum-algorithm complexity analysis.

The first problem that we would like to solve involves assuming that we are given an initial distribution $\phi(0)$ that is efficiently computable over our lattice, an evolution time $t$ and an error tolerance $\epsilon_{\rm dyn}$ to generate a quantum state $\ket{\mathcal{V}^{(k)}(x,t)}$ such that $\| \ket{\mathcal{V}^{(k)}(x,t)} - {\mathcal{V}^{(k)}(x,t)}/\|{\mathcal{V}^{(k)}(x,t)}\| \le \epsilon_{\rm dyn}$.  

The problem is the natural problem to first look at, however, it ignores the fact that the observables we are interested in do not act on the extended Hilbert space invoked through the use of Carleman linearization.  The overall problem that we are interested in is then if we define the projector onto the first Carleman block to be $\ket{\phi_0}\!\bra{\phi_0}\otimes I$ then we aim to minimize
\begin{equation}
\|(\bra{\phi_0}\otimes I)(\ket{\mathcal{V}^{(k)}(x,t)} / \|(\bra{\phi_0}\otimes I)(\ket{\mathcal{V}^{(k)}(x,t)}\| - \phi(x)/\|\phi(x)\| \|\le \epsilon_{\rm total}.
\end{equation}
Our aim is then to separate the two sources of error in the problem and use to observation that if $\epsilon_{\rm total} \le \epsilon_{\rm dyn} + \epsilon_{\rm carl}$ then it suffices to make both of these error sources small.  Through existing arguments, we can construct a quantum algorithm that makes the former small.  We will make arguments here based on perturbation theory backed by numerics that $\epsilon_{\rm carl}$ can be made small in regimes of practical interest using small values of $k$.

\subsection{Carleman truncation error}

We now analyze the effect of truncating the infinite-dimensional Carleman system
of equations at a finite degree.  We show that the zeroth and first moments of the 
lattice Boltzmann distribution functions ($\rho$ and $\rho \vec u$) at $k$th degree
receive corrections from the higher-order Carleman variables at degrees $k+1$ and
$k+2$ and that these corrections are suppressed by $O(\text{Ma}^2)$.

The macroscopic properties of the LBE
fluid are given by moments of the lattice Boltzmann distribution functions, as
can be seen from \Eq{eq:rho}--(\ref{eq:u}): the
zeroth moment gives $\rho$, and the first moment gives $\rho \vec u$.  We introduce the
coefficient vectors
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_\rho = (1, \dots, 1)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_{\rho u} = (\vec{e}_1, \dots, \vec{e}_Q),
\end{equation}
which recover the macroscopic fluid variables by matrix-multiplying the vector of distribution functions such that
\begin{equation}
\rho = \sum_m (\Phi_\rho)_m f_m = \Phi_\rho f
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\rho \vec u = \sum_m (\Phi_{\rho u})_m f_m = \Phi_{\rho u} f.
\end{equation}
From the mixed-product property of the
Kronecker product,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:kromipro}
  (A \otimes B) (C \otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD),
\end{equation}
it follows that 
\begin{align}
  (\rho)^p (\rho \vec u)^q &= (\Phi_\rho f)^{[p]} (\Phi_{\rho u} f)^{[q]}\nonumber \\
                           &= \left(\Phi_\rho^{[p]}\otimes\Phi_{\rho u}^{[q]}\right) f^{[p+q]}
\end{align}
for arbitrary integers $p$ and $q$ (where products of spatial vectors imply the dot product).

Furthermore, inserting the quadratic and cubic terms in
\Eq{eq:lbm-grouped}, we obtain
(introducing the shorthand notation $\zeta_2$ and $\zeta_3$): 
\begin{align}
  \Phi_\rho     F^{(2)}f^{[2]} &= \frac 2 {\kn\tau} \sum_m w_m\left[c (\vec{e}_m\cdot
                                 \rho\vec{u})^2 + d\rho^2 u^2 \right] =
                                 \zeta_2 \rho^2 \nonumber \\
  \label{eq:rhoF2f2}
  &= O((\kn\tau)^{-1}\rho^{2}u^2) \\
  \Phi_\rho     F^{(3)}f^{[3]} &= -\frac 1 {\kn\tau} \sum_m w_m \left[c\rho^3(\vec{e}_m\cdot
                                 \vec{u})^2 + d\rho^3u^2 \right] =
                                 \zeta_3\rho^3 \nonumber \\
  \label{eq:rhoF3f3}
  &= O((\kn\tau)^{-1}\rho^{3}u^2) \\
  \\
  \label{eq:rhouF2f2}
  \Phi_{\rho u} F^{(2)}f^{[2]} &= \frac 2 {\kn\tau} \sum_m w_m\vec{e}_m\left[c (\vec{e}_m\cdot
                                 \rho\vec{u})^2 + d\rho^2 u^2 \right] = 0\\
  \label{eq:rhouF3f3}
  \Phi_{\rho u} F^{(3)}f^{[3]} &= -\frac 1 {\kn\tau} \sum_m w_m \vec{e}_m \left[c\rho^3(\vec{e}_m\cdot
                                 \vec{u})^2 + d\rho^3u^2 \right] = 0,
\end{align}
where the result $\Phi_{\rho u} F^{(2)}f^{[2]} = \Phi_{\rho u} F^{(3)}f^{[3]} =
0$ is a consequence of lattice symmetry dictating that the nonresting particles
occur in pairs of equal weight $w_m$ but opposite direction
$\vec{e}_m$, and the bounds in \Eq{eq:rhoF2f2} and
\Eq{eq:rhoF3f3} stem from $w_m=O(1)$ and $\sum_m w_m=1$.

The lowest-order correction to $\partial V^{(k)}/\partial t$ is given by the
elements of $C^{(k+1)}$ that are not present in $C^{(k)}$.  At this point, for
concreteness, we consider $k=3$ as an example:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:f2c4}
  \left[\ddt{f^{[2]}}\right]'_{(4)} &= A^2_4 f^{[4]} \\
  \label{eq:f3c4}
  \left[\ddt{f^{[3]}}\right]'_{(4)} &= A^3_4 f^{[4]} ,
\end{align}
where $[\partial/\partial t]'_{(k+1)}$ denotes said correction%  due to the
% elements of $C^{[k+1]}$ that are not present in $C^{[k]}$
.  By the definition
of $A^i_{i + j - 1}$ (\Eq{eq:defiBij}),
\begin{align}
  A^2_4 &= F^{(3)}\otimes \IdQ + \IdQ \otimes F^{(3)} \\
  A^3_4 &= F^{(2)}\otimes \IdQ \otimes \IdQ + \IdQ \otimes F^{(2)}\otimes \IdQ +
          \IdQ \otimes \IdQ \otimes F^{(2)}.
\end{align}
Using $\Phi_\rho$ and $\Phi_{\rho u}$ to construct corrections to degree 2 and 3
polynomials of $\rho$ and $\rho \vec u$ yields, again by the mixed-product rule
(\Eq{eq:kromipro}), substituting the expressions from
\Eq{eq:lbm-grouped} for $F^{(2)}f^{[2]}$ and $F^{(3)}f^{[3]}$,
and making use of \Eq{eq:rhoF2f2}--(\ref{eq:rhouF3f3}):
\begin{align}
  \left[\ddt{\rho^2}\right]'_{(4)}
  &= \Phi_\rho^{[2]} \left[\ddt{f^{[2]}}\right]'_{(4)} = \Phi_\rho^{[2]} A^2_4  f^{[4]} \nonumber \\
  &= (\Phi_\rho \otimes \Phi_\rho) \left(F^{(3)}\otimes \IdQ + \IdQ \otimes
    F^{(3)}\right) (f \otimes f \otimes f \otimes f) \nonumber \\
  &= (\Phi_\rho F^{(3)} f^{[3]})\otimes(\Phi_\rho\IdQ f) + (\Phi_\rho\IdQ
    f)\otimes(\Phi_\rho F^{(3)} f^{[3]}) \nonumber \\
  \label{eq:rho2c4}
  &= -\frac{2}{\kn\tau}du^2\rho \\
  \left[\ddt{\rho^2u^2}\right]'_{(4)}
  &= \Phi_{\rho u}^{[2]} \left[\ddt{f^{[2]}}\right]'_{(4)} = \Phi_{\rho u}^{[2]} A^2_4  f^{[4]} \nonumber \\
  &= (\Phi_{\rho u} \otimes \Phi_{\rho u}) \left(F^{(3)}\otimes \IdQ + \IdQ \otimes
    F^{(3)}\right) (f \otimes f \otimes f \otimes f) \nonumber \\
  \label{eq:rho2u2c4}
  &= 0.
\end{align}

We now derive a recursion formula for the higher-order corrections to powers of
$\rho$ and $\rho \vec u$ at arbitrary order, following steps very similar to the
$k=3$ example.  At any Carleman order $k$, corrections to $f^{[k-1]}$ and
$f^{[k]}$ arise due to the neglected terms containing $f^{[k+1]}$, which, by
inspection of \Eq{eq:Cdef}, can be written as
\begin{align}
  \left[\ddt{f^{[k-1]}}\right]'_{(k+1)} &= A^{k-1}_{k+1} f^{[k+1]} \\
  \left[\ddt{f^{[k]}}\right]'_{(k+1)} &= A^{k}_{k+1} f^{[k+1]}.
\end{align}
These equations are analogous to \Eq{eq:f2c4}--(\ref{eq:f3c4}) for the $k=3$
example.  Only these two subvectors of $V$ receive corrections due to the
diagonal band structure of \Eq{eq:Cinfdef}, whose striping is determined by
the presence of terms up to cubic degree in \Eq{eq:lbm-carleman}.  The
corresponding corrections to powers of the macroscopic fluid variables can be
derived by left multiplication with Kronecker powers of $\Phi_\rho$ and
$\Phi_{\rho u}$ in analogy to \Eq{eq:rho2c4}--(\ref{eq:rho2u2c4}):
\begin{align}
  \left[\ddt{\rho^{k-1}}\right]'_{(k+1)}
  &= \Phi_\rho^{[k-1]}A^{k-1}_{k+1}
    f^{[k+1]} \nonumber \\
  &= \left(\Phi_\rho^{[k-2]}\otimes\Phi_\rho\right)
    \left[\sum_{r=1}^{k-1} \IdQ^{[r-1]} \otimes F^{(3)} \otimes \IdQ^{[k-r-1]} \right]
    \left(f^{[k-2]}\otimes f^{[3]}\right)\nonumber \\
  &= -\frac{k-1}{\kn\tau}\left(\sum_m w_m \left[c\rho^3(\vec{e}_m\cdot\vec{u})^2 +
    d\rho^3u^2 \right]\right)\rho^{k-2} \nonumber \\
  &= O(k(\kn\tau)^{-1}\rho^{k+1}u^2) \\
  \left[\ddt{\rho^{k}}\right]'_{(k+1)}   &= \Phi_\rho^{[k]}A^{k}_{k+1} f^{[k+1]}
                                           \nonumber \\
  &= \left(\Phi_\rho^{[k-1]}\otimes\Phi_\rho\right)
    \left[\sum_{r=1}^{k} \IdQ^{[r-1]} \otimes F^{(2)} \otimes \IdQ^{[k-r]} \right]
    \left(f^{[k-1]}\otimes f^{[2]}\right)\nonumber \\
  &= \frac{2k}{\kn\tau}\left(\sum_m w_m \left[c\rho^2(\vec{e}_m\cdot\vec{u})^2 +
    d\rho^2u^2 \right]\right)\rho^{k-1} \nonumber \\
  &= O(k(\kn\tau)^{-1}\rho^{k+1}u^2) \\
  \label{eq:rhouF3fn}
  \left[\ddt{\rho^{p+q}u^{q}}\right]'_{(k+1)} &= 0, \quad q \geq p \geq 0, q > 0, p +
                                              q = k - 1 \\
  \label{eq:rhouF2fn}
  \left[\ddt{\rho^{p+q}u^{q}}\right]'_{(k+1)}   &= 0, \quad  q \geq p \geq 0, q > 0, p +
                                              q = k,
\end{align}
for integer $p$ and $q$ ($q \geq p$ is required for getting $[k-1]$th or $k$th $\poly(u, \rho)$), where \Eq{eq:rhouF3fn} and \Eq{eq:rhouF2fn} follow from
\Eq{eq:rhouF2f2} and \Eq{eq:rhouF3f3}.  Thus, the macroscopic fluid
properties follow a hierarchy where subsequent higher-order corrections are
suppressed by factors of $O(u^2) = O(\text{Ma}^2)$ relative to the
highest-order retained terms. 
Since the LBE is restricted to $\text{Ma}\ll 1$, the
Carleman truncation error and the Taylor expansion error on $1/\rho$
are small even when a low Carleman truncation order is used.  We also note that
the expression for the truncation error is independent of the system
size and Reynolds number, since the overall $(\kn\tau)^{-1}$ normalization is
common to the retained and neglected terms. This ensures that the Carleman order can be kept
constant as the system size is extended or $\text{Re}$ is increased. A numerical consistency check of the Carleman-linearized nonlinear collision term of \Eq{eq:LBMs} shows that the truncation error is on the order of $10^{-14}$ for the truncation order $k=3$ (\Fig{fig:CLBM_collision_error}). We refer to details of the LBM and CLBM simulations and the discussions in section~\ref{sec:simu}.

This is the basis of our claim in the main text that the Carleman order can be kept
constant as the system size is extended or $\text{Re}$ is increased.

\subsection{Quantum algorithm complexity}
\label{sec:qac}

In this section, we derive bounds on the complexity of applying the
\citet{Berry2017QuantumPrecision} algorithm to the Carleman-linearized
LBE of degree 3 at $n$ spatial grid points with $Q$ discrete
velocities (\Eq{eq:clbm}). For notational compactness, we
introduce the abbreviated notation
\begin{align}
  \mathcal V &= \mathcal V^{(3)}(\vec x) \\
  \mathcal C &= \mathcal C^{(3)}(\vec x).
\end{align}
Carleman order $k=3$ is explicitly chosen as we showed above that the
truncation error at $k=3$ is $O(\ma^2)$, which is sufficient to
prevent truncation error from dominating the solution error.

Before proceeding further, we summarize the properties of the physical
systems which can be simulated using our procedure, including
conditions that the systems must satisfy for the procedure to be
applicable.  We also give typical values of system parameters for a
particular application (atmospheric turbulence).  The key unrestricted
parameter of the physical application is the number of grid points
$n$.  For simulations of turbulent flows, the $n\gg 1$ behavior of the
algorithm is of utmost interest; for example, for direct simulations
of atmospheric turbulence, $n > 10^{20}$ is desirable (and
unattainable using state-of-the-art algorithms on classical computers).

\paragraph{Parameters of restricted range}
\label{sec:prop-of-phys-syst:param-restr-range}

The fluid flow to be modeled by our procedure needs to satisfy certain
conditions.  These conditions restrict two parameters of the flow, the
Mach number $\ma$ and Knudsen number $\kn$.  First, the flow needs to
be ``weakly compressible'', i.e., $\ma \ll 1$.  This is a
requirement both for the LBE to recover the NSE and for the linearized
LBE to approximate the nonlinear LBE (both of which errors scale as
$\ma^2$).  In LBM practice, $\ma < 10^{-1}$ is a typical upper bound,
but atmospheric flow satisfies $\ma \leq 10^{-2}$ in most
circumstances.  Second, the flow to be modeled must also be
``continuum flow'', i.e., macroscopic features like turbulent eddies
must be much larger than the molecular scale.  This is reflected in
Boltzmann relaxation parameter $\kn\tau\ll 1$.  Typical values in the
atmosphere are $\kn < 10^{-8}$.  The scaled relaxation $\tau$ is
restricted to the range $0.5<\tau\leq 1$ in LBM practice.
Furthermore, the relaxation
parameter restricts the number of grid points according to
\Eq{eq:kn-logn} to $\log n \ll (\kn\tau)^{-3}$.
This restriction is unlikely to have practical consequences; in the
atmospheric example, it is equivalent to $n \ll \exp(10^{24})$.
For
atmospheric flow, $\ma\ll 1$ is the most restrictive condition.

\paragraph{Free parameters}

The number of spatial grid points $n$ used to resolve the flow is
unrestricted, i.e., application science would like the largest value
possible subject to getting a result within a reasonable wallclock
time limit.  Reynolds number $\re$ is similarly unrestricted, i.e.,
application science would like the largest value possible.  Typical
values of these parameters currently attainable using state-of-the-art
classical algorithms and computers are $n\approx 10^9$ and
$\re \approx 10^5$.  The parameters $\re$, $n$, and physical integral
domain size $L$ are not independent; higher $\re$ requires finer
resolution, implying higher $n/L^d$ (in $d$ spatial dimensions).  A transformational capability in
atmospheric science would be direct numerical simulation of entire cloud systems
($L\approx 100$ km) at $\re\approx10^9$, which requires a spatial grid spacing of 1 mm (Kolmogorov length scale) or $n\approx 10^{21}$.

The physical integration time $\tilde T$ depends on specifics of the
physical problem.  It is typically determined by the time required for
the turbulence to spin up from homogeneous initial conditions and
for the turbulent eddies then to turn over several times so that
domain-mean statistics are representative of the fully developed
turbulent steady state.

\paragraph{Constants}

The number of discrete molecular velocities $Q$ is fixed, i.e., the same
value can be used for simulation of arbitrary systems (as long as
$\ma \ll 1$); values in widespread use are $Q\in\{3,9,27\}$ for 1D, 2D,
and 3D fluid flows, respectively.  The constants $a=1$, $b=3$, $c=9/2$, $d=-3/2$
are fixed for all lattice geometries, and the $w_m$ are fixed for each
specific lattice geometry.  For this reason, we consider these parameters to be constants; however, for some simulations it may be appropriate to take these to be free parameters that change as the desired simulation accuracy increases to minimize algorithmic complexity.

\paragraph{Solution error sources}

Two distinct sources of solution error appear.  The first is due to
the Carleman-linearized LBE being an approximation to the actual NSE
dynamics of the system; this error is $O(\ma^2)$, hence the $\ma\ll 1$
requirement for our procedure to be applicable.  The second is
discretization error in the time integration of $\partial\mathcal V/\partial t
= \mathcal C \mathcal V$ in the quantum algorithm; this is
parameterized by $\epsilon$, which should be chosen so it is not the
dominant error, i.e., $\epsilon=O(\ma^2)$.

The capability to apply the Carleman-linearized LBE to turbulent fluid dynamics, quantum algorithm complexity analysis, and domain applications to atmospheric science were developed 
under the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory, a multiprogram national laboratory operated by
Battelle for the United States Department of Energy (DOE). GKS and MSC were funded to consider domain applications to chemical physics and biophysics under U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office
of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and
Bioscience, Chemical Physics and Interfacial Sciences Program FWP 16249 and U.S. National Science Foundation grant NSF-MCB 2221824, respectively.

    "abstract": "We extend the results of our 2020 paper in the Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, Classe di Scienze. There, we associated to each of an infinite family of triangle Fuchsian groups a one-parameter family of continued fraction maps and showed that the matching (or, synchronization) intervals are of full measure. Here, we find planar extensions of each of the maps, and prove the continuity of the entropy function associated to each one-parameter family.\n  We also introduce a notion of \"first pointwise expansive power\" of an eventually expansive interval map. We prove that for every map in one of our one-parameter families its first pointwise expansive power map has its natural extension given by the first return of the geodesic flow to a cross section in the unit tangent bundle of the hyperbolic orbifold uniformized by the corresponding group. We conjecture that this holds for all of our maps. We give numerical evidence for the conjecture.",

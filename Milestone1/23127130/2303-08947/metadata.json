    "abstract": "Blackberry harvesting is a labor-intensive and costly process, consuming up to 50\\% of the total annual crop hours. This paper presents a solution for robotic harvesting through the design, manufacturing, integration, and control of a pneumatically actuated, kinematically redundant soft arm with a tendon-driven soft robotic gripper. The hardware design is optimized for durability and modularity for practical use. The harvesting process is divided into four stages: initial placement, fine positioning, grasp, and move back to home position. For initial placement, we propose a real-time, continuous gain-scheduled redundancy resolution algorithm for simultaneous position and orientation control with joint-limit avoidance. The algorithm relies solely on visual feedback from an eye-to-hand camera and achieved a position and orientation tracking error of $0.64\\pm{0.27}$ mm and $1.08\\pm{1.5}^{\\circ}$, respectively, in benchtop settings. Following accurate initial placement of the robotic arm, fine positioning is achieved using a combination of eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual feedback, reaching an accuracy of $0.75\\pm{0.36}$ mm. The system's hardware, feedback framework, and control methods are thoroughly validated through benchtop and field tests, confirming feasibility for practical applications.",

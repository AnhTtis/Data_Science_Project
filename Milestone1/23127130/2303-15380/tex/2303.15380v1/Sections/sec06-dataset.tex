\section{Dataset} 
\label{sec:dataset}

We believe that with \datasetname we contribute a valuable tool for the community working on human-to-human close interaction.
For a detailed list of its contents and comparison to existing datasets, please refer to \tabref{tab: dataset} and Supp. Mat.

We recruited 20 unique pairs of participants with varying body shapes and clothing styles to perform diverse interaction motion sequences of a few seconds, such as hugging, posing, dancing, and playing sports. We collected 100 independent clips with 11K frames in total and more than 6K frames of them with physical contact. Contact annotations in \datasetname cover over 95 \% of the parametric human body. The contact coverage and contact frequency of \datasetname is shown in \figref{fig: contact}.

We propose \datasetname, a method and dataset for the automatic analysis of physically close human-human interaction under prolonged contact. 
%
Robustly disentangling several in-contact subjects is a challenging task due to occlusions and complex shapes. Hence, existing multi-view systems typically fuse 3D surfaces of close subjects into a single, connected mesh.
%
To address this issue we leverage i) individually fitted neural implicit avatars; ii) an alternating optimization scheme that refines pose and surface through periods of close proximity; and iii) thus segment the fused raw scans into individual instances.
%
From these instances we compile \datasetname dataset of 4D textured scans of 20 subject pairs, 100 sequences, and a total of more than 11K frames. 
%
\datasetname contains rich interaction-centric annotations in 2D and 3D alongside accurately registered parametric body models.
%
We define varied human pose and shape estimation tasks on this dataset and provide results from state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks. Project page: \url{https://yifeiyin04.github.io/Hi4D/}.

\captionof{figure}{\textbf{Method and dataset.} We propose a method that leverages personalized human avatars to segment merged (A) 4D textured scans of multiple closely interacting humans. Based on the (B) instance meshes (with vertex-level contact annotations) we obtained in 3D space, we further provide (C) instance segmentation masks in 2D and 3D, (D) registered parametric body models with contact annotations.}

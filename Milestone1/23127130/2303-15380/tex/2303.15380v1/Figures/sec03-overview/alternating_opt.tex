  \caption{\textbf{Alternating optimization.} (A) Given personalized avatars for each subject (\figref{fig: method}), we jointly optimize the poses of each subject $\boldsymbol{\Theta}^p_t$ using a surface energy term. (B) With $\boldsymbol{\Theta}^p_t$ and merged raw scans $M^{raw}_t$, we refine the shape network weights $\sigma^p_t$ of the individual avatars on the fly to maximally preserve the details and model contact-aware deformations. We alternate between optimizing (A) and (B) for $N$ iterations. Afterwards, the optimized $\boldsymbol{\Theta}^p_t$ and refined $\sigma^p_t$ serve as initialization for the optimization process at the next frame $t+1$.}

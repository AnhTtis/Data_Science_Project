  \caption{\textbf{Method overview.} (A) Dynamic Personalized Priors: We build individual personalized implicit avatars from 4D posed scans of each subject by modeling shape and deformation fields in canonical space following \cite{chen2021snarf}. (B) Instance Segmentation During Interaction: We then leverage the pre-built individual avatars to track and segment the raw 4D scans of multiple closely interacting people through extended periods of dynamic physical contact by optimizing pose and shape in an alternating manner (\cf \figref{fig: alternating_opt} for more details).

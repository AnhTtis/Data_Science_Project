We present a novel method for tracking human, object and realistic contacts between them from monocular RGB cameras. Our first contribution is a \ourSMPL{} conditioned neural field network that allows consistent and more accurate 3D reconstruction in a video sequence. Our second contribution is a human motion and object visibility aware network that can recover the object pose under heavy occlusions. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state of the art methods in two datasets. Our extensive ablations show that our \ourSMPL{} conditioning and \hvopNet{} are important for accurate tracking. We also show that our method generalizes well to another dataset it is not trained on. Our code and model are released to promote future research in this direction.

\section{Limitations}
Although our method works robustly under heavy occlusions, there are still some limitations. For instance, we assume known object templates for tracking. An interesting direction is to build such a template from videos as demonstrated by recent works \cite{yang2021lasr, yang2021viser, yang2022banmo, wu2021dove}. Our method may fail under challenging cases such as significant object pose change under heavy occlusions. It can also make noisy pose predictions when the object is symmetric or the pose is uncommon. Example failure cases are shown in Supp.

    "abstract": "My research-creation process coincides with the encounter with the ''digital paradigm'' and the attempt to incorporate it into the foundation of my scenic writing. I propose in this paper to give an account from a director point of view of how I realized my shows between 2000 and 2007 and which researches influenced the process. I will formulate some remarks on the fragilities that can arise in a ''technological laboratory of staging''.",

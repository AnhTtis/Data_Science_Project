    "abstract": "We compute non-perturbative spectral functions in a scalar $φ^4$-theory in three spacetime dimensions via the spectral functional renormalisation group. This approach allows for the direct, manifestly Lorentz covariant computation of correlation functions in Minkowski spacetime, including a physical on-shell renormalisation. We present numerical results for the spectral functions of the two- and four-point correlation functions for different values of the coupling parameter. These results agree very well with those obtained from another functional real-time approach, the spectral Dyson-Schwinger equation.",

    "abstract": "Magnetically assembled superparamagnetic colloids have been exploited as fluid mixers, swimmers and delivery systems in several microscale applications. The encapsulation of such colloids in droplets may open new opportunities to build magnetically controlled displays and optical components. Here, we study the assembly of superparamagnetic colloids inside droplets under rotating magnetic fields and exploit this phenomenon to create functional optical devices. Colloids are encapsulated in monodisperse droplets produced by microfluidics and magnetically assembled into dynamic two-dimensional clusters. Using an optical microscope equipped with a magnetic control setup, we investigate the effect of the magnetic field strength and rotational frequency on the size, stability and dynamics of 2D colloidal clusters inside droplets. Our results show that cluster size and stability depend on the magnetic forces acting on the structure under the externally imposed field. By rotating the cluster in specific orientations, we illustrate how magnetic fields can be used to control the effective refractive index and the transmission of light through the colloid-laden droplets, thus demonstrating the potential of the encapsulated colloids in optical applications.",

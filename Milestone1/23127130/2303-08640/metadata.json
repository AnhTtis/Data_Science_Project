    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the global conservative weak solutions for a class of nonlinear dispersive wave equations after wave breaking. We first transform the equations into an equivalent semi-linear system by introducing new variables. We then establish the global existence of solutions for the semi-linear system by using the standard theory of ordinary differential equations. Finally, returning to the original variables, we obtain the global conservative weak solutions for the original equations.",

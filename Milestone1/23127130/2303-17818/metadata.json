    "abstract": "The saturated absorption spectrum of the hyperfine-less S(0) quadrupole line in the (2-0) band of H$_2$ is measured at $λ=1189$ nm, using the NICE-OHMS technique under cryogenic conditions (72~K). It is for the first time that a Lamb dip of a molecular quadrupole transition is recorded. At low (150-200 W) saturation powers a single narrow Lamb dip is observed, ruling out an underlying recoil doublet of 140 kHz. Studies of Doppler-detuned resonances show that the red-shifted recoil component can be made visible for low pressures and powers, and prove that the narrow Lamb dip must be interpreted as the blue recoil component. A transition frequency of 252\\,016\\,361\\,164\\,(8) kHz is extracted, which is off by -2.6 (1.6) MHz from molecular quantum electrodynamical calculations therewith providing a challenge to theory.",

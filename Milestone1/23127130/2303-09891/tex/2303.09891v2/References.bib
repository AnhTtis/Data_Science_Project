We report, for the first time in the literature, the linear viscoelastic response of an optically trapped bead suspended in a Newtonian fluid, over the entire range of experimentally accessible frequencies. The general validity of the proposed method makes it transferable to the majority of microrheology and rheology techniques.}

abstract={We present a straightforward method for measuring the relative viscosity of fluids via a simple graphical analysis of the normalised position autocorrelation function of an optically trapped bead, without the need of embarking on laborious calculations. The advantages of the proposed microrheology method are evident when it is adopted for measurements of materials whose availability is limited, such as those involved in biological studies. The method has been validated by direct comparison with conventional bulk rheology methods and has been applied both to characterise synthetic linear polyelectrolytes solutions and to study biomedical samples.},

title={i-{RheoFT}: Fourier transforming sampled functions without artefacts},
journal={Scientific Reports},
year={2021},
month={Dec},
day={15},
volume={11},
number={1},
pages={24047},
abstract={In this article we present a new open-access code named ``i-RheoFT'' that implements the analytical method first introduced in [PRE, 80, 012501 (2009)] and then enhanced in [New J Phys 14, 115032 (2012)], which allows to evaluate the Fourier transform of any generic time-dependent function that vanishes for negative times, sampled at a finite set of data points that extend over a finite range, and need not be equally spaced. I-RheoFT has been employed here to investigate three important experimental factors: (i) the `density of initial experimental points' describing the sampled function, (ii) the interpolation function used to perform the ``virtual oversampling'' procedure introduced in [New J Phys 14, 115032 (2012)], and (iii) the detrimental effect of noises on the expected outcomes. We demonstrate that, at relatively high signal-to-noise ratios and density of initial experimental points, all three built-in MATLAB interpolation functions employed in this work (i.e., Spline, Makima and PCHIP) perform well in recovering the information embedded within the original sampled function; with the Spline function performing best. Whereas, by reducing either the number of initial data points or the signal-to-noise ratio, there exists a threshold below which all three functions perform poorly; with the worst performance given by the Spline function in both the cases and the least worst by the PCHIP function at low density of initial data points and by the Makima function at relatively low signal-to-noise ratios. We envisage that i-RheoFT will be of particular interest and use to all those studies where sampled or time-averaged functions, often defined by a discrete set of data points within a finite time-window, are exploited to gain new insights on the systems' dynamics.},

	abstract = {Microrheology is a branch of rheology having the same principles as conventional bulk rheology, but working on micron length scales and microlitre volumes.

Optical tweezers have been successfully used with Newtonian fluids for rheological purposes such as determining fluid viscosity. Conversely, when optical tweezers are used to measure the viscoelastic properties of complex fluids the results are either limited to the material’s high-frequency response, discarding important information related to the low-frequency behaviour, or they are supplemented by low-frequency measurements performed with different techniques, often without presenting an overlapping region of clear agreement between the sets of results. We present a simple experimental procedure to perform microrheological measurements over the widest frequency range possible with optical tweezers. A generalized Langevin equation is used to relate the frequency-dependent moduli of the complex fluid to the time-dependent trajectory of a probe particle as it flips between two optical traps that alternately switch on and off.}

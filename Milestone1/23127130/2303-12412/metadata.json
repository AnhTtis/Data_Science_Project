    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a special class of Capelli bitableaux, namely the Capelli-Deruyts bitableaux. The main results we prove are the hook coefficient lemma and the expansion theorem. Capelli-Deruyts bitableaux of rectangular shape are of particular interest since they are central elements in the enveloping algebra. The expansion theorem implies that these central element is explicitely described as a polynomial in the classical Capelli central elements. The hook coefficient lemma implies that the Capelli-Deruyts bitableaux are (canonically) expressed as the products of column determinants.",

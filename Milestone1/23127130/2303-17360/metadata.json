    "abstract": "In this article, we consider the kinetic derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation (KDNLS), which is a one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a cubic derivative nonlinear term containing the Hilbert transformation. For the Cauchy problem both on the real line and on the circle, we apply the short-time Fourier restriction method to establish a priori estimate for small and smooth solutions in Sobolev spaces $H^s$ with $s>1/4$.",

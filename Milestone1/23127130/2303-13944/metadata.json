    "abstract": "This paper first introduces a new generalized inverse in Minkowski space, called the m-DMP inverse, and discusses its algebraic and geometrical properties. The second objective is to characterize the m-DMP inverse equivalently by ranges, null spaces and matrix equations, and show its integral and limiting representations and several explicit expressions. Finally, the paper gives applications of the m-DMP inverse in solving a system of linear equations and a constrained optimization problem.",

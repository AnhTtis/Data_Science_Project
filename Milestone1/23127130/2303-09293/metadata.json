    "abstract": "In recent years, transformer architecture has been a dominating paradigm in many applications, including affective computing. In this report, we propose our transformer-based model to handle Emotion Classification Task in the 5th Affective Behavior Analysis In-the-wild Competition. By leveraging the attentive model and the synthetic dataset, we attain a score of 0.4775 on the validation set of Aff-Wild2, the dataset provided by the organizer.",

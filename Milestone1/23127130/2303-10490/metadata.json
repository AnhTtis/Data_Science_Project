    "abstract": "We investigate the parameterized complexity of several problems formalizing cluster identification in graphs. In other words we ask whether a graph contains a large enough and sufficiently connected subgraph. We study here three relaxations of CLIQUE: $s$-CLUB and $s$-CLIQUE, in which the relaxation is focused on the distances in respectively the cluster and the original graph, and $γ$-COMPLETE SUBGRAPH in which the relaxation is made on the minimal degree in the cluster. As these three problems are known to be NP-hard, we study here their parameterized complexities. We prove that $s$-CLUB and $s$-CLIQUE are NP-hard even restricted to graphs of degeneracy $\\le 3$ whenever $s \\ge 3$, and to graphs of degeneracy $\\le 2$ whenever $s \\ge 5$, which is a strictly stronger result than its W[1]-hardness parameterized by the degeneracy. We also obtain that these problems are solvable in polynomial time on graphs of degeneracy $1$. Concerning $γ$-COMPLETE SUBGRAPH, we prove that it is W[1]-hard parameterized by both the degeneracy, which implies the W[1]-hardness parameterized by the number of vertices in the $γ$-complete-subgraph, and the number of elements outside the $γ$-complete subgraph.",

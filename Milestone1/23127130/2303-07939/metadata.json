    "abstract": "We investigate the $2\\,^3\\!S_1$--$2\\,^3\\!P_J$ ($J = 0, 1, 2$) transitions in $\\rm^6Li^+$ using the optical Ramsey technique and achieve the most precise values of the hyperfine splittings of the $2\\,^3\\!S_1$ and $2\\,^3\\!P_J$ states, with smallest uncertainty of about 10~kHz. The present results reduce the uncertainties of previous experiments by a factor of 5 for the $2\\,^3\\!S_1$ state and a factor of 50 for the $2\\,^3\\!P_J$ states, and are in better agreement with theoretical values. Combining our measured hyperfine intervals of the $2\\,^3\\!S_1$ state with the latest quantum electrodynamic (QED) calculations, the improved Zemach radius of the $\\rm^6Li$ nucleus is determined to be 2.44(2)~fm, with the uncertainty entirely due to the uncalculated QED effects of order $mα^7$. The result is in sharp disagreement with the value 3.71(16) fm determined from simple models of the nuclear charge and magnetization distribution. We call for a more definitive nuclear physics value of the $\\rm^6Li$ Zemach radius.",

abstract = {Abstract Apart from energy generation, the storage and liberation of energy are among the major problems in establishing a sustainable energy supply chain. Herein we report the development of a rechargeable H2 battery which is based on the principle of the Ru-catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid (charging process) and the Ru-catalyzed decomposition of formic acid to CO2 and H2 (discharging process). Both processes are driven by the same catalyst at elevated temperature either under pressure (charging process) or pressure-free conditions (discharging process). Up to five charging–discharging cycles were performed without decrease of storage capacity. The resulting CO2/H2 mixture is free of CO and can be employed directly in fuel-cell technology.},

abstract = {Ruthenium complexes are well known as remarkable pre-catalysts for challenging C–H bond functionalizations. Combining them with other types of chemical reactions in a tandem or one-pot fashion is appealing from a sustainable point of view because it gives access to new strategies to diminish steps devoted to purification and isolation of (sometimes unstable) intermediates. This non-exhaustive review highlights the different approaches enabling these technologies with a particular focus on the understanding for the compatibility of the different reaction sequences. More precisely, ruthenium-catalyzed C–H bond functionalization turned out to be compatible with several organic transformations, metal-mediated reactions and transition metal catalysis.}

abstract = {Abstract Non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries are promising for next-generation energy storage. New battery chemistries based on LiOH, rather than Li2O2, have been recently reported in systems with added water, one using a soluble additive LiI and the other using solid Ru catalysts. Here, the focus is on the mechanism of Ru-catalyzed LiOH chemistry. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, operando electrochemical pressure measurements, and mass spectrometry, it is shown that on discharging LiOH forms via a 4 e− oxygen reduction reaction, the H in LiOH coming solely from added H2O and the O from both O2 and H2O. On charging, quantitative LiOH oxidation occurs at 3.1 V, with O being trapped in a form of dimethyl sulfone in the electrolyte. Compared to Li2O2, LiOH formation over Ru incurs few side reactions, a critical advantage for developing a long-lived battery. An optimized metal-catalyst–electrolyte couple needs to be sought that aids LiOH oxidation and is stable towards attack by hydroxyl radicals.},

abstract = {Ru4-xTax (x = 1,2,3) alloys are studied as absorber candidates for EUV low-n mask. We report the morphology, surface roughness as well as the chemical composition of the as-deposited alloy films for better theoretical model building of the EUVL absorber stack. Their refractive indices are reconstructed by optimizing measured EUV reflectivity data for the purpose of enabling rigorous EUVL imaging calculations in the future work. The stabilities (both physical and chemical) of these absorber candidates are verified which contribute to a long lifetime of the mask in its working environment. This includes the resistance assessments of the thin films against high temperature up to 500 °C, different mask cleaning solutions and hydrogen environment which is present in EUV scanners. Etching of RuTa is explored using halogen-based reactive ion etch technique. A low etch rate is obtained with a moderate etch selectivity to Ru, which is the capping layer of multilayer mirror on a EUVL mask.}

	abstract = {Amorphous TaN thin films have been prepared by remote plasma-assisted metal organic chemical vapor deposition using pentakis-dimethyl-amino-tantalum (PDMATa) in hydrogen plasma. The dependence of film properties such as resistivity, impurity contents, and microstructures on deposition conditions is reported. All obtained films have been tested as diffusion barriers between platinum and silicon in a stacked-capacitor type memory cell for future, high-density ferroelectric memories. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been used to determine the nature of carbon incorporation into the film, which is responsible for the observed microstructure of the deposited film. Recrystallization occurs at an annealing temperatures of 1000°C in an oxygen-containing (10) ambient, showing (111) TaN, [bcc] Ta, and orthorhombic Ta2O5. It was determined that a TaN barrier layer can be successfully applied as a barrier layer between platinum and silicon (700°C for 30 min in an oxygen-containing ambient), preventing the silicidation reaction of silicon with a Pt electrode as well as the oxidation of the underlying capacitor electrode during the capacitor formation process.}

The results were then combined with the assessed ternary Si–Ta–C, Ta–C–Cu, Si–Ta–N and Ta–N–Cu phase diagrams. It was found that both barriers ultimately failed due to diffusion of Cu through the barrier and accompanied formation of Cu3Si at temperatures higher than 725°C. However, in the TaC barriers the formation of amorphous TaOx layer with significant amounts of C took place at the TaC/Cu interface already at 600°C. Similar behaviour at ‘low’ temperatures was also noted in the Ta2N barriers.}

abstract  ="The development of new safe and effective contrast agents (CAs) is a crucial factor to increase the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT). For now{,} tantalum oxide-based nanoparticles (TaOx NPs) are among the most promising CAs for CT due to their superior properties: high X-ray attenuation coefficient{,} excellent biocompatibility{,} and easily modifiable surface chemistry. Compared to the commercially available analogs (iodine-based CAs){,} TaOx NPs provide better contrast performance{,} long-circulation{,} and high safety profiles (reduced exposure of X-rays and CA dosage). Among the investigated nanoparticulate CAs they afford higher cost-effectiveness (Au{,} Pt{,} Lu). TaOx NPs can also be easily modified to include other imaging or therapeutic modalities. This review aims to summarize the current state-of-the-art knowledge in the field of tantalum oxide-based CAs used for single or multimodal imaging and theranostic purposes. The design specification of TaOx NPs in terms of size{,} surface functionalization{,} composition{,} and their influence on the contrast performance{,} toxicity{,} and pharmacokinetics are discussed.

abstract  ="Development of low-cost and high-performance oxygen evolution reaction catalysts is key to implementing polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysers for hydrogen production. Iridium-based oxides are the state-of-the-art acidic oxygen evolution reaction catalysts but still suffer from inadequate activity and stability, and iridium’s scarcity motivates the discovery of catalysts with lower iridium loadings. Here we report a mass-selected iridium–tantalum oxide catalyst prepared by a magnetron-based cluster source with considerably reduced noble-metal loadings beyond a commercial IrO2 catalyst. A sensitive electrochemistry/mass-spectrometry instrument coupled with isotope labelling was employed to investigate the oxygen production rate under dynamic operating conditions to account for the occurrence of side reactions and quantify the number of surface active sites. Iridium–tantalum oxide nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm exhibit a mass activity of 1.2 ± 0.5 kA gIr–1 and a turnover frequency of 2.3 ± 0.9 s−1 at 320 mV overpotential, which are two and four times higher than those of mass-selected IrO2, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that special iridium coordinations and the lowered aqueous decomposition free energy might be responsible for the enhanced performance."}

abstract = {Abstract Minimizing carrier recombination at contact regions by using carrier-selective contact materials, instead of heavily doping the silicon, has attracted considerable attention for high-efficiency, low-cost crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. A novel electron-selective, passivating contact for c-Si solar cells is presented. Tantalum nitride (TaN x ) thin films deposited by atomic layer deposition are demonstrated to provide excellent electron-transporting and hole-blocking properties to the silicon surface, due to their small conduction band offset and large valence band offset. Thin TaNx interlayers provide moderate passivation of the silicon surfaces while simultaneously allowing a low contact resistivity to n-type silicon. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 20\% is demonstrated with c-Si solar cells featuring a simple full-area electron-selective TaNx contact, which significantly improves the fill factor and the open circuit voltage (Voc) and hence provides the higher PCE. The work opens up the possibility of using metal nitrides, instead of metal oxides, as carrier-selective contacts or electron transport layers for photovoltaic devices.},

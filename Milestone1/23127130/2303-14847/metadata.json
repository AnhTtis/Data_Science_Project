    "abstract": "Taking the formal analogies between black holes and classical thermodynamics seriously seems to first require that classical thermodynamics applies to relativistic regimes. Yet, by scrutinizing how classical temperature is extended into special relativity, I argue that it falls apart. I examine four consilient procedures for establishing classical temperature - the Carnot process, the thermometer, kinetic theory, and black-body radiation. I show how their relativistic counterparts demonstrate no such consilience in defining relativistic temperature. Hence, classical temperature does not appear to survive a relativistic extension. I suggest two interpretations for this situation - eliminativism akin to simultaneity, or pluralism akin to rotation.",

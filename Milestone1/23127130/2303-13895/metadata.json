    "abstract": "Stochastic filtering refers to estimating the probability distribution of the latent stochastic process conditioned on the observed measurements in time. In this paper, we introduce a new class of convergent filters that represent the filtering distributions by their moments. The key enablement is a quadrature method that uses orthonormal polynomials spanned by the moments. We prove that this moment-based filter is asymptotically exact in the order of moments, and show that the filter is also computationally efficient and is in line with the state of the art.",

Large language models (LLMs) can enhance writing by automating or supporting specific tasks in writers' workflows (e.g., paraphrasing, creating analogies).
Leveraging this capability, a collection of interfaces have been developed that provide LLM-powered tools for specific writing tasks. However, these interfaces provide limited support for writers to create personal tools for their own unique tasks, and may not comprehensively fulfill a writer’s needs---requiring them to continuously switch between interfaces during writing.
In this work, we envision LMCanvas, an interface that enables writers to create their own LLM-powered writing tools and arrange their personal writing environment by interacting with ``blocks’’ in a canvas. 
In this interface, users can create text blocks to encapsulate writing and LLM prompts, model blocks for model parameter configurations, and connect these to create pipeline blocks that output generations.
In this workshop paper, we discuss the design for LMCanvas and our plans to develop this concept.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a study of generalized polyhedral convexity under basic operations on set-valued mappings. We address the preservation of generalized polyhedral convexity under sums and compositions of set-valued mappings, the domains and ranges of generalized polyhedral convex set-valued mappings, and the direct and inverse images of sets under such mappings. Then we explore the class of optimal value functions defined by a generalized polyhedral convex objective function and a generalized polyhedral convex constrained mapping. The new results obtained provide a framework for representing the relative interior of the graph of a generalized polyhedral convex set-valued mapping in terms of the relative interiors of its domain and mapping values in locally convex topological vector spaces. Among the new results in this paper is a significant extension of a result by Bonnans and Shapiro on the domain of generalized polyhedral convex set-valued mappings from Banach spaces to locally convex topological vector spaces.",

    "abstract": "Microarray technology is a new and powerful tool for the concurrent monitoring of a large number of gene expressions. Each microarray experiment produces hundreds of images. Each digital image requires a large storage space. Hence, real-time processing of these images and transmission of them necessitates efficient and custom-made lossless compression schemes. In this paper, we offer a new architecture for the lossless compression of microarray images. In this architecture, we have used dedicated hardware for the separation of foreground pixels from background ones. By separating these pixels and using pipeline architecture, a higher lossless compression ratio has been achieved as compared to other existing methods.",

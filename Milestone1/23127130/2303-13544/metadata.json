    "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to engaging children in Nigeria to share their views of AI. This approach is centered on an inclusive writing contest for children in a secondary school in Abuja to write about AI to compete for prizes and share their writings with others. A preliminary analysis of the first 11 articles we received exhibits diverse gender and ethnic representation that conveys cultural values and perspectives distinct from those of the children in the western countries. This finding suggests future work to conduct in-depth cross-cultural analysis of the articles and to replicate similar writing contests to engage children in other underrepresented countries.",

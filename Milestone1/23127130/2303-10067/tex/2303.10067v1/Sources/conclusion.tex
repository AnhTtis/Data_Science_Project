\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

We presented in this paper a comprehensive overview of the problem of AND. To overcome this problem, we proposed a novel framework that consists of a lot of supervised models. Each of these models is dedicated to distinguishing among authors who share the same atomic name variate (i.e. first name initial and last name) by leveraging the co-authors and the titles and sources of their known publications. The experiments on challenging and real-scenario datasets have shown promising and satisfactory results on AND. We also demonstrated the limitations and challenges that are inherent in this process.


To overcome some of these limitations and challenges, we plan for future work to exploit citation graphs so that author names can be linked to real-world entities by employing the co-authors of their co-authors. We assume that using this reverse process, the identity of the target author can be found among the co-authors of his/her co-authors. We plan also to learn the research area of co-authors in order to overcome the issue of new co-authorships.

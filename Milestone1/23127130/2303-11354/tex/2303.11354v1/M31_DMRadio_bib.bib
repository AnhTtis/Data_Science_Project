@article{planckcollaborationPlanck2018Results2020,
	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5 σ level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ``base ΛCDM'' in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density Ωch2 = 0.120 $\pm$ 0.001, baryon density Ωbh2 = 0.0224 $\pm$ 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 $\pm$ 0.004, and optical depth τ = 0.054 $\pm$ 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68 \% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95 \% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03 \% precision, with 100θ∗ = 1.0411 $\pm$ 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-ΛCDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4$\pm$0.5) km s−1Mpc−1; matter density parameter Ωm = 0.315$\pm$0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude σ8 = 0.811$\pm$0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-ΛCDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neff = 2.99 $\pm$ 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to mν {\textless} 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base ΛCDM at over 2 σ, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the ΛCDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, ΩK = 0.001$\pm$0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = −1.03 $\pm$ 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {\textless} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-ΛCDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6 σ, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

@article{carrConstraintsPrimordialBlack2020,
	abstract = {We update the constraints on the fraction of the Universe going into primordial black holes (PBHs) over the mass range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}\{50\}\$ g. Those smaller than \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$ g would have evaporated by now due to Hawking radiation, so their abundance at formation is constrained by the effects of evaporated particles on big bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the Galactic and extragalactic \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray and cosmic ray backgrounds and the possible generation of stable Planck mass relics. PBHs larger than \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$ g are subject to a variety of constraints associated with gravitational lensing, dynamical effects, influence on large-scale structure, accretion and gravitational waves. We discuss the constraints on both the initial collapse fraction and the current fraction of the cold dark matter in PBHs at each mass scale but stress that many of the constraints are associated with observational or theoretical uncertainties and some are no longer applicable. We also consider indirect constraints associated with the amplitude of the primordial density fluctuations, such as second-order tensor perturbations and \${\textbackslash}mu\$-distortions arising from the effect of acoustic reheating on the CMB, but these only apply if PBHs are created from the high-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ peaks of nearly Gaussian fluctuations. Finally we discuss how the constraints are modified if the PBHs have an extended mass function, this being relevant if PBHs provide some combination of the dark matter, the LIGO/Virgo coalescences and the seeds for cosmic structure.},

@article{jaffeMultiquarkHadronsII1977,
	abstract = {Techniques for estimating the masses and decay couplings of multiquark hadrons (Qm¯Qn, n+m{\textgreater}3) are developed with specific reference to the Q2¯Q2 sector. The dynamics is based on a quark-bag model of light, colored, and permanently confined quarks gauge-coupled to non-Abelian colored gluons. The SU (6) of "color-spin" generated by color SU (3) and the SU (2) of relativistic j=12 quarks dominates the spectrum. Color-spin rules analogous to Hund's rules of atomic spectroscopy dictate that the lightest multiquark handrons are not exotic, are of low spin, and are coupled predominantly to strange Q3 and Q¯Q decay channels, Multiquark hadrons are consequently elusive and may be misclassified as conventional Q¯Q mesons or Q3 baryons.},

@article{wittenCosmicSeparationPhases1984,
	abstract = {A first-order QCD phase transition that occurred reversibly in the early universe would lead to a surprisingly rich cosmological scenario. Although observable consequences would not necessarily survive, it is at least conceivable that the phase transition would concentrate most of the quark excess in dense, invisible quark nuggets, providing an explanation for the dark matter in terms of QCD effects only. This possibility is viable only if quark matter has energy per baryon less than 938 MeV. Two related issues are considered in appendices: the possibility that neutron stars generate a quark-matter component of cosmic rays, and the possibility that the QCD phase transition may have produced a detectable gravitational signal.},

@article{aziziScalarHexaquarkUuddss2020,
	abstract = {It is conventionally argued that Dark Matter (DM) has a non-baryonic nature, but if we assume that DM was frozen out before primordial nucleosynthesis and could not significantly impact primordial abundances this argument may be evaded. Then a hypothetical \$SU(3)\$ flavor-singlet, highly symmetric, deeply bound neutral scalar hexaquark \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{S\}=uuddss\$, which due to its features has escaped from experimental detection so far, may be considered as a candidate for a baryonic DM. In the present work we calculate the mass and coupling constant of the scalar six-quark particle \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{S\}\$ by means of the QCD sum rule method. Our predictions for its mass are \$ m\_\{S\}=1180\_\{-26\}{\textasciicircum}\{+40\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{MeV\}\$ (\$m\_s=95{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{MeV\}\$) and \$ {\textbackslash}widetilde \{m\}\_\{S\}=1239\_\{-28\}{\textasciicircum}\{+42\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{MeV\}\$ (\$m\_s=128{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{MeV\}\$).

@article{aprileExcessElectronicRecoil2020,
	abstract = {We report results from searches for new physics with low-energy electronic recoil data recorded with the XENON1T detector. With an exposure of 0.65 t-y and an unprecedentedly low background rate of \$76{\textbackslash}pm2\$ events/(t y keV) between 1 and 30 keV, the data enables sensitive searches for solar axions, an enhanced neutrino magnetic moment, and bosonic dark matter. An excess over known backgrounds is observed at low energies and most prominent between 2 and 3 keV. The solar axion model has a 3.4\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance, and a 3D 90\% confidence surface is reported for axion couplings to electrons, photons, and nucleons. This surface is inscribed in the cuboid defined by \$g\_\{ae\}{\textless}3.8 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-12\}\$, \$g\_\{ae\}g\_\{an\}{\textasciicircum}\{eff\}{\textless}4.8{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-18\}\$, and \$g\_\{ae\}g\_\{a{\textbackslash}gamma\}{\textless}7.7{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-22\} GeV{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and excludes either \$g\_\{ae\}=0\$ or \$g\_\{ae\}g\_\{a{\textbackslash}gamma\}=g\_\{ae\}g\_\{an\}{\textasciicircum}\{eff\}=0\$. The neutrino magnetic moment signal is similarly favored over background at 3.2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ and a confidence interval of \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\} {\textbackslash}in (1.4,2.9){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-11\}{\textbackslash}mu\_B\$ (90\% C.L.) is reported. Both results are in strong tension with stellar constraints. The excess can also be explained by \${\textbackslash}beta\$ decays of tritium at 3.2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ with a trace amount that can neither be confirmed nor excluded with current knowledge of its production and reduction mechanisms. The significances of the solar axion and neutrino magnetic moment hypotheses are reduced to 2.0\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ and 0.9\${\textbackslash}sigma\$, respectively, if an unconstrained tritium component is included in the fitting. With respect to bosonic dark matter, the excess favors a monoenergetic peak at (\$2.3{\textbackslash}pm0.2\$) keV (68\% C.L.) with a 3.0\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ global (4.0\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ local) significance. We also consider the possibility that \${\textasciicircum}\{37\}\$Ar may be present in the detector and yield a 2.82 keV peak. Contrary to tritium, the \${\textasciicircum}\{37\}\$Ar concentration can be tightly constrained and is found to be negligible.},

	abstract = {Past studies have identified a spatially extended excess of \${\textbackslash}sim\$1-3 GeV gamma rays from the region surrounding the Galactic Center, consistent with the emission expected from annihilating dark matter. We revisit and scrutinize this signal with the intention of further constraining its characteristics and origin. By applying cuts to the {\textbackslash}textit\{Fermi\} event parameter CTBCORE, we suppress the tails of the point spread function and generate high resolution gamma-ray maps, enabling us to more easily separate the various gamma-ray components. Within these maps, we find the GeV excess to be robust and highly statistically significant, with a spectrum, angular distribution, and overall normalization that is in good agreement with that predicted by simple annihilating dark matter models. For example, the signal is very well fit by a 36-51 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to \$b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\}\$ with an annihilation cross section of \${\textbackslash}sigma v = (1-3){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-26\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}3\$/s (normalized to a local dark matter density of 0.4 GeV/cm\${\textasciicircum}3\$). Furthermore, we confirm that the angular distribution of the excess is approximately spherically symmetric and centered around the dynamical center of the Milky Way (within \${\textbackslash}sim\$\$0.05{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ of Sgr A\${\textasciicircum}*\$), showing no sign of elongation along the Galactic Plane. The signal is observed to extend to at least \${\textbackslash}simeq10{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ from the Galactic Center, disfavoring the possibility that this emission originates from millisecond pulsars.},

	abstract = {We construct empirical models of the diffuse gamma-ray background toward the Galactic Center. Including all known point sources and a template of emission associated with interactions of cosmic rays with molecular gas, we show that the extended emission observed previously in the Fermi Large Area Telescope data toward the Galactic Center is detected at high significance for all permutations of the diffuse model components. However, we find that the fluxes and spectra of the sources in our model change significantly depending on the background model. In particular, the spectrum of the central Sgr A\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast\$ source is less steep than in previous works and the recovered spectrum of the extended emission has large systematic uncertainties, especially at lower energies. If the extended emission is interpreted to be due to dark matter annihilation, we find annihilation into pure \$b\$-quark and \${\textbackslash}tau\$-lepton channels to be statistically equivalent goodness of fits. In the case of the pure \$b\$-quark channel, we find a dark matter mass of \$39.4{\textbackslash}left({\textasciicircum}\{+3.7\}\_\{-2.9\}{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash} stat.{\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}pm 7.9{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash} sys.{\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash} GeV\$, while a pure \${\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}\{+\} {\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}\{-\}\$-channel case has an estimated dark matter mass of \$9.43{\textbackslash}left({\textasciicircum}\{+0.63\}\_\{-0.52\}{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash} stat.{\textbackslash}right)({\textbackslash}pm 1.2{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash} sys.){\textbackslash} GeV\$. Alternatively, if the extended emission is interpreted to be astrophysical in origin such as due to unresolved millisecond pulsars, we obtain strong bounds on dark matter annihilation, although systematic uncertainties due to the dependence on the background models are significant.},

	abstract = {The possible gamma-ray excess in the inner Galaxy and the Galactic center (GC) suggested by Fermi -LAT observations has triggered a large number of studies. It has been interpreted as a variety of different phenomena such as a signal from WIMP dark matter annihilation, gamma-ray emission from a population of millisecond pulsars, or emission from cosmic rays injected in a sequence of burst-like events or continuously at the GC. We present the first comprehensive study of model systematics coming from the Galactic diffuse emission in the inner part of our Galaxy and their impact on the inferred properties of the excess emission at Galactic latitudes 2◦ {\textless} {\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textless} 20◦ and 300 MeV to 500 GeV. We study both theoretical and empirical model systematics, which we deduce from a large range of Galactic diffuse emission models and a principal component analysis of residuals in numerous test regions along the Galactic plane. We show that the hypothesis of an extended spherical excess emission with a uniform energy spectrum is compatible with the Fermi -LAT data in our region of interest at 95\% CL. Assuming that this excess is the extended counterpart of the one seen in the inner few degrees of the Galaxy, we derive a lower limit of 10.0◦ (95\% CL) on its extension away from the GC. We show that, in light of the large correlated uncertainties that affect the subtraction of the Galactic diffuse emission in the relevant regions, the energy spectrum of the excess is equally compatible with both a simple broken power-law of break energy Ebreak = 2.1 $\pm$ 0.2 GeV, and with spectra predicted by the self-annihilation of dark matter, implying in the case of ¯bb final states a dark matter mass of mχ = 49+−65..44 GeV.},

	abstract = {Employing Fermi-LAT gamma ray observations, several independent groups have found excess extended gamma ray emission at the Galactic center (GC). Both, annihilating dark matter (DM) or a population of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}3\$ unresolved millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are regarded as well motivated possible explanations. However, there is significant uncertainties in the diffuse galactic background at the GC. We have performed a revaluation of these two models for the extended gamma ray source at the GC by accounting for the systematic uncertainties of the Galactic diffuse emission model. We also marginalize over point source and diffuse background parameters in the region of interest. We show that the excess emission is significantly more extended than a point source. We find that the DM (or pulsars population) signal is larger than the systematic errors and therefore proceed to determine the sectors of parameter space that provide an acceptable fit to the data. We found that a population of order a 1000 MSPs with parameters consistent with the average spectral shape of Fermi-LAT measured MSPs was able to fit the GC excess emission. For DM, we found that a pure \${\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}-\$ annihilation channel is not a good fit to the data. But a mixture of \${\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}-\$ and \$b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\}\$ with a \${\textbackslash}left{\textless}{\textbackslash}sigma v{\textbackslash}right{\textgreater}\$ of order the thermal relic value and a DM mass of around 20 to 60 GeV provides an adequate fit.},

We use five years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and updated models of the gamma-ray emission from standard astrophysical components to search for a dark matter annihilation signal from the LMC. We perform a rotation curve analysis to determine the dark matter distribution, setting a robust minimum on the amount of dark matter in the LMC, which we use to set conservative bounds on the annihilation cross section. The LMC emission is generally very well described by the standard astrophysical sources, with at most a \$1-2{\textbackslash}sigma\$ excess identified near the kinematic center of the LMC once systematic uncertainties are taken into account. We place competitive bounds on the dark matter annihilation cross section as a function of dark matter particle mass and annihilation channel.},

	abstract = {It was found in the Fermi-LAT data that there is an extended γ-ray excess in the Galactic center region. The proposed sources to be responsible for the excess include dark matter annihilation or an astrophysical alternative from a population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Whether or not the MSP scenario can explain the data self-consistently has very important implications for the detection of particle dark matter, which is however, subject to debate in the literature. In this work we study the MSP scenario in detail, based on the detected properties of the MSPs by Fermi-LAT. We construct a model of Milky Way disk-component MSPs which can reproduce the γ-ray properties of the observed Fermi-LAT MSPs, and derive the intrinsic luminosity function of the MSPs. The model is then applied to a bulge population of MSPs. We find that the extended γ-ray excess can be well explained by the bulge MSPs without violating the detectable flux distribution of MSPs by Fermi-LAT. The spatial distribution of the bulge MSPs as implied by the distribution of low mass X-ray binaries follows a r−2.4 profile, which is also consistent with the γ-ray excess data. We conclude that the MSP model can explain the Galactic center γ-ray excess self-consistently, satisfying all the current observational constraints.},

	abstract = {Several groups of authors have analyzed Fermi LAT data in a region around the Galactic Center finding an unaccounted gamma-ray excess over diffuse backgrounds in the GeV energy range. It has been argued that it is difficult or even impossible to explain this diffuse emission by the leading astrophysical candidates - millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Here we provide a new estimate of the contribution to the excess by a population of yet unresolved MSP located in the bulge of the Milky Way. We simulate this population with the GALPLOT package by adopting a parametric approach, with the range of free parameters gauged on the MSP characteristics reported by the second pulsar catalogue (2PC). We find that the conclusions strongly depend on the details of the MSP luminosity function (in particular, its high luminosity end) and other explicit or tacit assumptions on the MSP statistical properties, which we discuss. Notably, for the first time we study the importance of the possible secondary emission of the MSPs in the Galactic Center, \{\vphantom{\}}i.e. the emission via inverse Compton losses of electrons injected in the interstellar medium. Differently from a majority of other authors, we find that within current uncertainties a large if not dominant contribution of MSPs to the excess cannot be excluded. We also show that the sensitivities of future instruments or possibly already of the latest LAT data analysis (Pass 8) provide good perspectives to test this scenario by resolving a significant number of MSPs.},

	abstract = {We used radio observations of the neighbour galaxy M31 in order to put constraints on dark matter particle mass and annihilation cross section. Dark matter annihilation in M31 halo produces highly energetic leptons, which emit synchrotron radiation on radio frequencies in the galactic magnetic field. We predicted expected radio fluxes for the two annihilation channels: {\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}chi -{\textgreater} bb* and {\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}chi -{\textgreater} {\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}-. We then compared them with available data on the central radio emission of M31 as observed by four radio surveys: VLSS (74 MHz), WENSS (325 MHz), NVSS (1400 MHz) and GB6 (4850 MHz). Assuming a standard NFW dark matter density profile and a conservative magnetic field distribution inside the Andromeda galaxy, we find that the thermal relic annihilation cross section {\textless}{\textbackslash}sigma v{\textgreater} = 3*10{\textasciicircum}\{-26\} cm{\textasciicircum}3/s or higher are only allowed for WIMP masses greater than 100 GeV and 55 GeV for annihilation into bb* and {\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}- respectively. Taking into account potential uncertainties in the distributions of DM density and magnetic field, the mentioned WIMP limiting masses can be as low as 23 GeV for both channels, and as high as 280 and 130 GeV for annihilation into bb* and {\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}- respectively. These mass values exceed the best up-to-day known constraints from Fermi gamma observations: 40 GeV and 19 GeV respectively [A.Geringer-Sameth and S.M.Koushiappas, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 241303 (2011)]. Precise measurements of the magnetic field in the relevant region and better reconstruction of the DM density profile of M31 will be able to reduce the uncertainties of our exclusion limits.},

	abstract = {[Abridged] Indirect detection of dark matter (DM) by multi-wavelength astronomical observations provides a promising avenue for probing the particle nature of DM. In the case of DM consisting of Weakly-Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), self-annihilation ultimately produces observable products including \$e{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}pm\}\$ pairs and gamma rays. The gamma rays can be detected directly, while the \$e{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}pm\}\$ pairs can be detected by radio emission from synchrotron radiation or X-rays and soft gamma rays from inverse Compton scattering. An intriguing region to search for astrophysical signs of DM is the Galactic center (GC) of the Milky Way, due in part to an observed excess of gamma-rays that could be DM. A recent observation by the Fermi-LAT collaboration of a similar excess in the central region of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) leads us to explore the possibility of a DM-induced signal there as well. We use the RX-DMFIT tool to perform a multi-frequency analysis of potential DM annihilation emissions in M31. We consider WIMP models consistent with the GC excess and calculate the expected emission across the electromagnetic spectrum in comparison with available observational data from M31. We find that the particle models that best fit the M31 excess favor lower masses than the GC excess. The best fitting models are for a \$b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\}\$ final state with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}chi\}=11\$ GeV and \${\textbackslash}left{\textless}{\textbackslash}sigma v{\textbackslash}right{\textgreater}=2.6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-26\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}3\$s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, as well as an evenly mixed \$b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\}/{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}-\$ final state with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}chi\}=5.8\$ GeV and \${\textbackslash}left{\textless}{\textbackslash}sigma v{\textbackslash}right{\textgreater}=2.03{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-26\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}3\$s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. For conservative estimates of the diffusion and magnetic field models the expected radio emissions appear to be in tension with currently available data in the central region of M31, although this constraint has a fairly strong dependence on the values chosen for parameters describing the magnetic field strength and geometry.},

	abstract = {The Large Magellanic Cloud, at only 50 kpc away from us and known to be dark matter dominated, is clearly an interesting place where to search for dark matter annihilation signals. In this paper, we estimate the synchrotron emission due to WIMP annihilation in the halo of the LMC at two radio frequencies, 1.4 and 4.8 GHz, and compare it to the observed emission, in order to impose constraints in the WIMP mass vs. annihilation cross section plane. We use available Faraday rotation data from background sources to estimate the magnitude of the magnetic field in different regions of the LMC's disc, where we calculate the radio signal due to dark matter annihilation. We account for the e+e− energy losses due to synchrotron, Inverse Compton Scattering and bremsstrahlung, using the observed hydrogen and dust temperature distribution on the LMC to estimate their efficiency. The extensive use of observations, allied with conservative choices adopted in all the steps of the calculation, allow us to obtain very realistic constraints.},

Key empirical facts about stellar systems are briefly reviewed, and the ingredients needed to construct galaxy models are assembled, including potential theory, stellar orbits, and the theory of the equilibrium configurations of stellar systems. The stability of these configurations and the theory of spiral structures are discussed. Collisions and encounters between stellar systems are considered, and two-body
realization and the approach to statistical equilibrium in star clusters are addressed. It is shown how the observable properties of galaxies such as their luminosities and colors are changed by the aging of their constituent stellar populations. Finally, it is shown that most of the mass in the universe is locked up in some still invisible form.},

@article{bajkovaRotationCurveMass2016,
	abstract = {Three three-component (bulge, disk, halo) model Galactic gravitational potentials differing by the expression for the dark matter halo are considered. The central (bulge) and disk components are described by the Miyamoto--Nagai expressions. The Allen--Santill´an (I), Wilkinson-Evans (II), and Navarro--Frenk--White (III) models are used to describe the halo. A set of present-day observational data in the range of Galactocentric distances R from 0 to 200 kpc is used to refine the parameters of these models. For the Allen--Santill´an model, a dimensionless coefficient γ has been included as a sought-for parameter for the first time. In the traditional and modified versions, γ = 2.0 and 6.3, respectively. Both versions are considered in this paper. The model rotation curves have been fitted to the observed velocities by taking into account the constraints on the local matter density ρ⊙ = 0.1M⊙ pc−3 and the force Kz=1.1/2πG = 77M⊙pc−2 acting perpendicularly to the Galactic plane. The Galactic mass within a sphere of radius 50 kpc, MG(R ≤ 50 kpc) ≈ (0.41 $\pm$ 0.12) × 1012M⊙, is shown to satisfy all three models. The differences between the models become increasingly significant with increasing radius R. In model I, the Galactic mass within a sphere of radius 200 kpc at γ = 2.0 turns out to be greatest among the models considered, MG(R ≤ 200 kpc) = (1.45 $\pm$ 0.30) × 1012M⊙, MG(R ≤ 200 kpc) = (1.29 $\pm$ 0.14) × 1012M⊙ at γ = 6.3, and the smallest value has been found in model II, MG(R ≤ 200 kpc) = (0.61 $\pm$ 0.12) × 1012M⊙. In our view, model III is the best one among those considered, because it ensures the smallest residual between the data and the constructed model rotation curve provided that the constraints on the local parameters hold with a high accuracy. Here, the Galactic mass is MG(R ≤ 200 kpc) = (0.75 $\pm$ 0.19) × 1012M⊙. A comparative analysis with the models by Irrgang et al. (2013), including those using the integration of orbits for the two globular clusters NGC 104 and NGC 1851 as an example, has been performed. The third model is shown to have subjected to a significant improvement.},

@article{1996ApJ...462..563N,
	abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density pro les of all our halos can be t over two decades in radius by scaling a simple {\textbackslash}universal" pro le. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which re ects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo pro les are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are signi cantly shallower than r 2 near the center and steeper than r 2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities signi cantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The rst problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, the second that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

	abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

@article{geninaCorecuspProblemMatter2018,
	abstract = {The existence of two kinematically and chemically distinct stellar subpopulations in the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf galaxies offers the opportunity to constrain the density profile of their matter haloes by measuring the mass contained within the wellseparated half-light radii of the two metallicity subpopulations. Walker and Pen˜arrubia have used this approach to argue that data for these galaxies are consistent with constant-density `cores' in their inner regions and rule out `cuspy' Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) profiles with high statistical significance, particularly in the case of Sculptor. We test the validity of these claims using dwarf galaxies in the APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment) Λ cold dark matter cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of analogues of the Local Group. These galaxies all have NFW dark matter density profiles and a subset of them develop two distinct metallicity subpopulations reminiscent of Sculptor and Fornax. We apply a method analogous to that of Walker and Pen˜arrubia to a sample of 50 simulated dwarfs and find that this procedure often leads to a statistically significant detection of a core in the profile when in reality there is a cusp. Although multiple factors contribute to these failures, the main cause is a violation of the assumption of spherical symmetry upon which the mass estimators are based. The stellar populations of the simulated dwarfs tend to be significantly elongated and, in several cases, the two metallicity populations have different asphericity and are misaligned. As a result, a wide range of slopes of the density profile are inferred depending on the angle from which the galaxy is viewed.},

We utilize a new suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that explore WDM masses of 1, 2 and 4 keV (assuming the WDM consists of thermal relics), along with different physically motivated thermal histories. We carefully address different sources of systematic error that may affect our final results and perform an analysis of the Lya flux power with conservative error estimates. By using a method that samples the multi-dimensional astrophysical and cosmological parameter space, we obtain a lower limit mwdm {\textgreater} 3.3 keV (2sigma) for warm dark matter particles in the form of early decoupled thermal relics. Adding the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Lya flux power spectrum does not improve this limit. Thermal relics of masses 1 keV, 2 keV and 2.5 keV are disfavoured by the data at about the 9sigma, 4sigma and 3sigma C.L., respectively. Our analysis disfavours WDM models where there is a suppression in the linear matter power spectrum at (non-linear) scales corresponding to k=10h/Mpc which deviates more than 10\% from a LCDM model. Given this limit, the corresponding "free-streaming mass" below which the mass function may be suppressed is 2x10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun/h. There is thus very little room for a contribution of the free-streaming of WDM to the solution of what has been termed the small scale crisis of cold dark matter.},

	abstract = {We present the effective \$J\$-factors for the Milky Way for scenarios in which dark matter annihilation is p-wave or d-wave suppressed. We find that the velocity suppression of dark matter annihilation can have a sizable effect on the morphology of a potential dark matter annihilation signal in the Galactic Center. The gamma-ray flux from the innermost region of the Galactic Center is in particular suppressed. We find that for dark matter density profiles with steep inner slopes, the morphology of the Inner Galaxy gamma-ray emission in p-wave models can be made similar to the morphology in standard s-wave models. This similarity may suggest that model discrimination between s-wave and p-wave is challenging, for example, when fitting the Galactic Center excess. However, we show that it is difficult to simultaneously match s- and p-wave morphologies at both large and small angular scales. The \$J\$-factors we calculate may be implemented with astrophysical foreground models to self-consistently determine the morphology of the excess with velocity-suppressed dark matter annihilation.},

	abstract = {The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has opened the way for comparative studies of cosmic rays (CRs) and high-energy objects in the Milky Way (MW) and in other, external, star-forming galaxies. Using 2 yr of observations with the Fermi LAT, Local Group galaxy M31 was detected as a marginally extended gamma-ray source, while only an upper limit has been derived for the other nearby galaxy M33. We revisited the gamma-ray emission in the direction of M31 and M33 using more than 7 yr of LAT Pass 8 data in the energy range 0.1−100 GeV, presenting detailed morphological and spectral analyses. M33 remains undetected, and we computed an upper limit of 2.0×10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 on the 0.1−100 GeV energy flux (95\% confidence level). This revised upper limit remains consistent with the observed correlation between gamma-ray luminosity and star-formation rate tracers and implies an average CR density in M33 that is at most half of that of the MW. M31 is detected with a significance of nearly 10σ. Its spectrum is consistent with a power law with photon index Γ = 2.4 $\pm$ 0.1stat+syst and a 0.1−100 GeV energy flux of (5.6 $\pm$ 0.6stat+syst) × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1. M31 is detected to be extended with a 4σ significance. The spatial distribution of the emission is consistent with a uniform-brightness disk with a radius of 0◦. 4 and no offset from the center of the galaxy, but nonuniform intensity distributions cannot be excluded. The flux from M31 appears confined to the inner regions of the galaxy and does not fill the disk of the galaxy or extend far from it. The gamma-ray signal is not correlated with regions rich in gas or star-formation activity, which suggests that the emission is not interstellar in origin, unless the energetic particles radiating in gamma rays do not originate in recent star formation. Alternative and nonexclusive interpretations are that the emission results from a population of millisecond pulsars dispersed in the bulge and disk of M31 by disrupted globular clusters or from the decay or annihilation of dark matter particles, similar to what has been proposed to account for the so-called Galactic center excess found in Fermi-LAT observations of the MW.},

	abstract = {The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the second-largest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way and is only 60 kpc away. As a nearby, massive, and dense object with relatively low astrophysical backgrounds, it is a natural target for dark matter indirect detection searches. In this work, we use six years of Pass 8 data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope to search for gamma-ray signals of dark matter annihilation in the SMC. Using data-driven fits to the gamma-ray backgrounds, and a combination of N-body simulations and direct measurements of rotation curves to estimate the SMC DM density profile, we found that the SMC was well described by standard astrophysical sources, and no signal from dark matter annihilation was detected. We set conservative upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section. These constraints are in agreement with stronger constraints set by searches in the Large Magellanic Cloud and approach the canonical thermal relic cross section at dark matter masses lower than 10 GeV in the \$b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}-\$ channels.},

	abstract = {We calculate the effective \$J\$-factors, which determine the strength of indirect detection signals from dark matter annihilation, for 25 dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). We consider several well-motivated assumptions for the relative velocity dependence of the dark matter annihilation cross section: \${\textbackslash}sigma\_A v\$: \$s\$-wave (velocity independent), \$p\$-wave (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_A v {\textbackslash}propto v{\textasciicircum}2\$), \$d\$-wave (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_A v {\textbackslash}propto v{\textasciicircum}4\$), and Sommerfeld-enhancement in the Coulomb limit (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_A v {\textbackslash}propto 1/v\$). As a result we provide the largest and most updated sample of J-factors for velocity-dependent annihilation models. For each scenario, we use Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data to constrain the annihilation cross section. Due to the assumptions made in our gamma-ray data analysis, our bounds are comparable to previous bounds on both the \$p\$-wave and Sommerfeld-enhanced cross sections using dSphs. Our bounds on the \$d\$-wave cross section are the first such bounds using indirect detection data.},

@article{dameMilkyWayMolecular2001,
	abstract = {New large-scale CO surveys of the first and second Galactic quadrants and the nearby molecular cloud complexes in Orion and Taurus, obtained with the CfA 1.2 m telescope, have been combined with 31 other surveys obtained over the past two decades with that instrument and a similar telescope on Cerro Tololo in Chile, to produce a new composite CO survey of the entire Milky Way. The survey consists of 488,000 spectra that Nyquist or beamwidth (1/8$\,^{\circ}$) sample the entire Galactic plane over a strip 4$\,^{\circ}$-10$\,^{\circ}$ wide in latitude, and beamwidth or 1/4$\,^{\circ}$ sample nearly all large local clouds at higher latitudes. Compared with the previous composite CO survey of Dame et al. (1987), the new survey has 16 times more spectra, up to 3.4 times higher angular resolution, and up to 10 times higher sensitivity per unit solid angle. Each of the component surveys was integrated individually using clipping or moment masking to produce composite spatial and longitude-velocity maps of the Galaxy that display nearly all of the statistically significant emission in each survey but little noise. The composite maps provide detailed information on individual molecular clouds, suggest relationships between clouds and regions widely separated on the sky, and clearly display the main structural features of the molecular Galaxy. In addition, since the gas, dust, and Population I objects associated with molecular clouds contribute to the Galactic emission in every major wavelength band, the precise kinematic information provided by the present survey will form the foundation for many largescale Galactic studies. A map of molecular column density predicted from complete and unbiased farinfrared and 21 cm surveys of the Galaxy was used both to determine the completeness of the present survey and to extrapolate it to the entire sky at {\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textless} 32$\,^{\circ}$. The close agreement of the observed and predicted maps implies that only {\textasciitilde}2\% of the total CO emission at {\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textless} 32$\,^{\circ}$ lies outside our current sampling, mainly in the regions of Chamaeleon and the Gum Nebula. Taking into account this small amount of unobserved emission, the mean molecular column density decreases from {\textasciitilde}3 x 1020 cm-2 at {\textbar}b{\textbar} = 5$\,^{\circ}$ to {\textasciitilde}0.1 x 1020 cm-2 at {\textbar}b{\textbar} = 30$\,^{\circ}$; this drop is {\textasciitilde}6 times steeper than would be expected from a plane parallel layer, but is consistent with recent measurements of the mean molecular column density at higher latitudes. The ratio of the predicted molecular column density map to the observed CO intensity map provides a calibration of the CO-to-H2 mass conversion factor X ≡ NH2/WCO. Out of the Galactic plane ({\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textgreater} 5$\,^{\circ}$), X shows little systematic variation with latitude from a mean value of 1.8 $\pm$ 0.3 x 1020 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s. Given the large sky area and large quantity of CO data analyzed, we conclude that this is the most reliable measurement to date of the mean X value in the solar neighborhood.},

	abstract = {High-energy γ-rays of interstellar origin are produced by the interaction of cosmic-ray (CR) particles with the diffuse gas and radiation fields in the Galaxy. The main features of this emission are well understood and are reproduced by existing CR propagation models employing 2D Galactocentric cylindrically symmetrical geometry. However, the high-quality data from instruments like the Fermi Large Area Telescope reveal significant deviations from the model predictions on few to tens of degree scales indicating the need to include the details of the Galactic spiral structure and thus require 3D spatial modelling. In this paper the high-energy interstellar emissions from the Galaxy are calculated using the new release of the GALPROP code employing 3D spatial models for the CR source and interstellar radiation field (ISRF) densities. Three models for the spatial distribution of CR sources are used that are differentiated by their relative proportion of input luminosity attributed to the smooth disc or spiral arms. Two ISRF models are developed based on stellar and dust spatial density distributions taken from the literature that reproduce local near- to far-infrared observations. The interstellar emission models that include arms and bulges for the CR source and ISRF densities provide plausible physical interpretations for features found in the residual maps from high-energy γ-ray data analysis. The 3D models for CR and ISRF densities provide a more realistic basis that can be used for the interpretation of the non-thermal interstellar emissions from the Galaxy.},

@article{caloreDarkMatterConstraints2018,
	abstract = {Dwarf galaxies represent a powerful probe of annihilating dark matter particle models, with gamma-ray data setting some of the best bounds available. A major issue in improving over existing constraints consists in the limited knowledge of the astrophysical background (mostly diffuse photons, but also unresolved sources). Perhaps more worrisome, several approaches in the literature suffer of the difficulty of assessing the systematic error due to background mis-modelling. Here we propose a data-driven method to estimate the background at the dwarf position and its uncertainty, relying on an appropriate use of the whole-sky data, via an optimisation procedure of the interpolation weights. While this article is mostly methodologically oriented, we also report the bounds based on latest Fermi-LAT data and updated information for J-factors for both isolated and stacked dwarfs. Our results are very competitive with the Fermi-LAT ones, while being derived with a more general and flexible method. We discuss the impact of profiling over the J-factor as well as over the background probability distribution function, with the latter resulting for instance crucial in drawing conclusions of compatibility with DM interpretations of the so-called Galactic Centre Excess.},

	abstract = {Expressions are derived for the total energy loss and photon-production spectrum by the processes of Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and synchrotron radiation from highly relativistic electrons. For Compton scattering, the general case, the Thomson limit, and the extreme Klein-Nishina limit are considered. Bremsstrahlung is treated for the cases where the electron is scattered by a pure Coulomb field and by an atom. For the latter case the effects of shielding are discussed extensively. The synchrotron spectrum is derived for an electron moving in a circular orbit perpendicular to the magnetic field and also for the general case where the electron's motion is helical. The total photon-production spectrum is derived for each process when there is a power-law distribution of electron energies. The problems of the effects of the three processes on the electron distribution itself are considered. It is shown that if the electron loses a small fraction of its energy in a single occurrence of a process, the electron distribution function satisfies a continuity equation which is a differential equation in energy space. For the more general case where the electron can lose energy in discrete amounts (as in bremsstrahlung and extreme Klein-Nishina Compton losses), the electron distribution function satisfies an integro-differential equation. Some approximate solutions to this equation are derived for certain special cases.},

The energy spectrum of the photons that are scattered by the electron has been calculated both exactly and in a greatly simplied approximate form suitable for astrophysical calculations. The approximation may be derived either by expanding the exact solution in a small parameter and keeping only the leading terms or by employing a simplifying physical approximation at the beginning of the calculation. The approximate spectrum is similar to one previously derived by Ginzburg and Syrovatskii, the principal difference being that the present one does not break down if ℏω1E{\textgreater}(mec2)2, where ℏω1 is the initial photon energy and E the electron energy. We indicate the astrophysical applications of our approximate spectrum by calculating the spectrum of photons scattered by electrons with an inverse-power-law energy distribution.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of the corpuscular nature of radiation by Planck more than fifty years ago the quantum theory of radiation has gone through many stages of development which seemed to alternate between spectacular success and hopeless frustration. The most recent phase started in 1947 with the discovery of the electromagnetic level shifts and the realization that the exist- ing theory, when properly interpreted, was perfectly adequate to explain these effects to an apparently unlimited degree of accuracy. This phase has now reached a certain conclusion: for the first time in the checkered history of this field of research it has become possible to give a unified and consistent presen- tation of radiation theory in full conformity with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics. To this task the present book is devoted. The plan for a book of this type was conceived during the year 1951 while the first-named author (J. M. J. ) held a Fulbright research scholarship at Cambridge University. During this year of freedom from teaching and other duties he had the opportunity of conferring with physicists in many different countries on the recent developments in radiation theory. The comments seemed to be almost unanimous that a book on quantum electrodynamics at the present time would be of inestimable value to physicists in many parts of the world. However, it was not until the spring of 1952 that work on the book began in earnest.},

	abstract = {We extend previous work modeling the Galactic magnetic field in the plane using synchrotron emission in total and polarised intensity. In this work, we include a more realistic treatment of the cosmic-ray electrons using the galprop propagation code optimized to match the existing high-energy data. This addition reduces the degeneracies in our previous analysis and when combined with an additional observed synchrotron frequency allows us to study the low-energy end of the cosmic-ray electron spectrum in a way that has not previously been done. For a pure diffusion propagation, we find a low-energy injection spectrum slightly harder than generally assumed; for J(E) ∝ Eα, we find α = −1.34 $\pm$ 0.12, implying a very sharp break with the spectrum above a few GeV. This then predicts a synchrotron brightness temperature spectral index, β, on the Galactic plane that is −2.8 {\textless} β {\textless} −2.74 below a few GHz and −2.98 {\textless} β {\textless} −2.91 up to 23 GHz. We find that models including cosmic-ray re-acceleration processes appear to be incompatible with the synchrotron data.},

	abstract = {We present a study of the magnetic field of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), carried out using diffuse polarized synchrotron emission data at 1.4 GHz acquired at the Parkes Radio Telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The observed diffuse polarized emission is likely to originate above the LMC disk on the near side of the galaxy. Consistent negative rotation measures (RMs) derived from the diffuse emission indicate that the line-of-sight magnetic field in the LMC's near-side halo is directed coherently away from us. In combination with RMs of extragalactic sources that lie behind the galaxy, we show that the LMC's large scale magnetic field is likely to be of quadrupolar geometry, consistent with the prediction of dynamo theory. On smaller scales, we identify two brightly polarized filaments southeast of the LMC, associated with neutral hydrogen arms. The filaments' magnetic field potentially aligns with the direction towards the Small Magellanic Cloud. We suggest that tidal interactions between the Small and the Large Magellanic Clouds in the past 109 years is likely to have shaped the magnetic field in these filaments.},

We use a self-consistent picture for cluster formation and evolution starting from a primordial density perturbation spectrum, and a realistic modelling for the distribution of the intergalactic medium which is abundantly present within galaxy clusters. We find that an evolving population of clusters can produce a fraction ∼ 0.5 ÷ 2\% of the diffuse gamma-ray background (DGRB) observed by EGRET. This result is robust and is weakly dependent on the cosmological scenario and on the degree of evolution of the inter galactic medium (IGM) in distant clusters, because the bulk of the sources contributing to the DGRB is located at redshifts z ∼{\textless} 0.2. We also found a correlation between the non-thermal, gamma-ray and the thermal X-ray emissions from these structures. Using this result, we derived a list of gamma-ray clusters observable with the next generation γ-ray detectors. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible relevance of galaxy clusters for neutrino astronomy and for very high energy particle astronomy.},

	abstract = {We study the astrophysical implications of neutralino dark matter annihilations in galaxy clusters, with a specific application to the Coma cluster. We first address the determination of the dark halo models for Coma, starting from structure formation models and observational data, and we discuss in detail the role of subhalos. We then perform a thorough analysis of the transport and diffusion properties of neutralino annihilation products, and investigate the resulting multi-frequency signals, from radio to gamma-ray frequencies. We also study other relevant astrophysical effects of neutralino annihilations, like the DM-induced Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the intracluster gas heating. As for the particle physics setup, we adopt a two-fold approach, resorting both to model-independent bottom-up scenarios and to benchmark, GUT-motivated frameworks. We show that the Coma radio-halo data (the spectrum and the surface brightness) can be nicely fitted by the neutralino-induced signal for peculiar particle physics models and for magnetic field values, which we outline in detail. Fitting the radio data and moving to higher frequencies, we find that the multi-frequency spectral energy distributions are typically dim at EUV and X-ray frequencies (with respect to the data), but show a non-negligible gamma-ray emission, depending on the amplitude of the Coma magnetic field. A simultaneous fit to the radio, EUV and HXR data is not possible without violating the gamma-ray EGRET upper limit. The best-fit particle physics models yields substantial heating of the intracluster gas, but not sufficient energy injection as to explain the quenching of cooling flows in the innermost region of clusters. Due to the specific multi-frequency features of the DM-induced spectral energy distribution in Coma, we find that supersymmetric models can be significantly and optimally constrained either in the gamma-rays or at radio and microwave frequencies.},

	abstract = {We describe a method for the numerical computation of the propagation of primary and secondary nucleons, primary electrons, and secondary positrons and electrons. Fragmentation and energy losses are computed using realistic distributions for the interstellar gas and radiation fields, and diffusive reacceleration is also incorporated. The models are adjusted to agree with the observed cosmic-ray B/C and 10Be/ 9Be ratios. Models with diffusion and convection do not account well for the observed energy dependence of B/C, while models with reacceleration reproduce this easily. The height of the halo propagation region is determined, using recent 10Be/ 9Be measurements, as {\textgreater} 4 kpc for diffusion/convection models and 4 -- 12 kpc for reacceleration models. For convection models we set an upper limit on the velocity gradient of dV /dz {\textless} 7 km s−1 kpc−1. The radial distribution of cosmic-ray sources required is broader than current estimates of the SNR distribution for all halo sizes. Full details of the numerical method used to solve the cosmic-ray propagation equation are given.},

	abstract = {Our closest neighbours, the Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies, are extremely quiescent and dim objects, where thermal and non-thermal diffuse emissions lack, so far, of detection. In order to possibly study the dSph interstellar medium, deep observations are required. They could reveal non-thermal emissions associated with the very-low level of star formation, or to particle dark matter annihilating or decaying in the dSph halo. In this work, we employ radio observations of six dSphs, conducted with the Australia Telescope Compact Array in the frequency band 1.1-3.1 GHz, to test the presence of a diffuse component over typical scales of few arcmin and at an rms sensitivity below 0.05 mJy/beam. We observed the dSph fields with both a compact array and long baselines. Short spacings led to a synthesized beam of about 1 arcmin and were used for the extended emission search. The high-resolution data mapped background sources, which in turn were subtracted in the short-baseline maps, to reduce their confusion limit. We found no significant detection of a diffuse radio continuum component. After a detailed discussion on the modelling of the cosmic-ray (CR) electron distribution and on the dSph magnetic properties, we present bounds on several physical quantities related to the dSphs, such that the total radio flux, the angular shape of the radio emissivity, the equipartition magnetic field, and the injection and equilibrium distributions of CR electrons. Finally, we discuss the connection to far-infrared and X-ray observations.},

Combined with its measured spectrum, this new extended source is approximately consistent with inverse Compton emission from a high-energy electron-positron population with energies up to about 10 GeV. Previously detected emissions tracing the 20 cm radio, interpreted as bremsstrahlung radiation, and the Galactic Center Extended emission tracing a spherical distribution and peaking at 2 GeV, are also detected. We show that the inverse Compton and bremsstrahlung emissions are likely due to the same source of electrons and positrons. All three extended emissions may be explained within the framework of a model where the dark matter annihilates to leptons or a model with unresolved millisecond pulsars in the Galactic Center.},

	abstract = {The inner degrees of the Galactic center contain a large population of filamentary structures observed at radio frequencies. These so-called non-thermal radio filaments (NRFs) trace magnetic field lines and have attracted significant interest due to their hard (Sv ∝ ν −0.1 $\pm$ 0.4) synchrotron emission spectra. The origin of these filaments remains poorly understood. We show that the electrons and positrons created through the annihilations of a relatively light (∼5-10 GeV) dark matter particle with the cross section predicted for a simple thermal relic can provide a compelling match to the intensity, spectral shape, and flux variation of the NRFs. Furthermore, the characteristics of the dark matter particle necessary to explain the synchrotron emission from the NRFs is consistent with those required to explain the excess γ-ray emission observed from the Galactic center by the Fermi-LAT, as well as the direct detection signals observed by CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA.},

	abstract = {Dark matter (DM) particles are predicted by several well motivated models to yield Standard Model particles through self-annihilation that can potentially be detected by astrophysical observations. In particular, the production of charged particles from DM annihilation in astrophysical systems that contain magnetic fields yields radio emission through synchrotron radiation and X-ray emission through inverse Compton scattering of ambient photons. We introduce RX-DMFIT, a tool used for calculating the expected secondary emission from DM annihilation. RX-DMFIT includes a wide range of customizable astrophysical and particle parameters and incorporates important astrophysics including the diffusion of charged particles, relevant radiative energy losses, and magnetic field modelling. We demonstrate the use and versatility of RX-DMFIT by analyzing the potential radio and X-ray signals for a variety of DM particle models and astrophysical environments including galaxy clusters, dwarf spheroidal galaxies and normal galaxies. We then apply RX-DMFIT to a concrete example using Segue I radio data to place constraints for a range of assumed DM annihilation channels. For WIMP models with Mχ ≤ 100 GeV and assuming weak diffusion, we find that the the leptonic µ+µ− and τ +τ − final states provide the strongest constraints, placing limits on the DM particle cross-section well below the thermal relic cross-section, while even for the b¯b channel we find limits close to the thermal relic cross-section. Our analysis shows that radio emission provides a highly competitive avenue for dark matter searches.},

	abstract = {We performed a deep search for radio synchrotron emissions induced by weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) annihilation or decay in six dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of the Local Group. Observations were conducted with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 16 cm wavelength, with an rms sensitivity better than 0.05 mJy/beam in each field. In this work, we first discuss the uncertainties associated with the modeling of the expected signal, such as the shape of the dark matter (DM) profile and the dSph magnetic properties. We then investigate the possibility that point-sources detected in the proximity of the dSph optical center might be due to the emission from a DM cuspy profile. No evidence for an extended emission over a size of few arcmin (which is the DM halo size) has been detected. We present the associated bounds on the WIMP parameter space for different annihilation/decay final states and for different astrophysical assumptions. If the confinement of electrons and positrons in the dSph is such that the majority of their power is radiated within the dSph region, we obtain constraints on the WIMP annihilation rate which are well below the thermal value for masses up to few TeV. On the other hand, for conservative assumptions on the dSph magnetic properties, the bounds can be dramatically relaxed. We show however that, within the next 10 years and regardless of the astrophysical assumptions, it will be possible to progressively close in on the full parameter space of WIMPs by searching for radio signals in dSphs with SKA and its precursors.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that the Galactic Center Excess identified in the FermiLAT gamma-ray data arises from a population of faint astrophysical sources. We provide compelling supporting evidence by showing that the morphology of the excess traces the stellar over-density of the Galactic bulge. By adopting a template of the bulge stars obtained from a triaxial 3D fit to the diffuse near-infrared emission, we show that it is detected at high significance. The significance deteriorates when either the position or the orientation of the template is artificially shifted, supporting the correlation of the gamma-ray data with the Galactic bulge. In deriving these results, we have used more sophisticated templates at low-latitudes for the Fermi bubbles compared to previous work and the three-dimensional Inverse Compton (IC) maps recently released by the GALPROP team. Our results provide strong constraints on Millisecond Pulsar (MSP) formation scenarios proposed to explain the excess. We find that an admixture formation scenario, in which some of the relevant binaries are primordial and the rest are formed dynamically, is preferred over a primordial-only formation scenario at 7.6σ confidence level. Our detailed morphological analysis also disfavors models of the disrupted globular clusters scenario that predict a spherically symmetric distribution of MSPs in the Galactic bulge. For the first time, we report evidence of a high energy tail in the nuclear bulge spectrum that could be the result of IC emission from electrons and positrons injected by a population of MSPs and star formation activity from the same site.},

Several theories have been proposed for this `Galactic Centre Excess'. They include self-annihilation of dark matter particles, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars, an unresolved population of young pulsars, or a series of burst events. Here we report on a new analysis that exploits hydrodynamical modelling to register the position of interstellar gas associated with diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission. We find evidence that the Galactic Centre Excess gamma rays are statistically better described by the stellar over-density in the Galactic bulge and the nuclear stellar bulge, rather than a spherical excess. Given its non-spherical nature, we argue that the Galactic Centre Excess is not a dark matter phenomenon but rather associated with the stellar population of the Galactic bulge and nuclear bulge.},

	abstract = {Aims. Stellar mass distribution in the Andromeda galaxy (M 31) is estimated using optical and near-infrared imaging data. Combining the derived stellar mass model with various kinematical data, properties of the dark matter (DM) halo of the galaxy are constrained. Methods. SDSS observations through the ugriz filters and the Spitzer imaging at 3.6 microns are used to sample the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the galaxy at each imaging pixel. Intrinsic dust extinction effects are taken into account by using far-infrared observations. Synthetic SEDs created with different stellar population synthesis models are fitted to the observed SEDs, providing estimates for the stellar mass surface density at each pixel. The stellar mass distribution of the galaxy is described with a 3-dimensional model consisting of a nucleus, a bulge, a disc, a young disc and a halo component, each following the Einasto density distribution (relations between different functional forms of the Einasto density distribution are given in Appendix B). By comparing the stellar mass distribution to the observed rotation curve and kinematics of outer globular clusters and satellite galaxies, the DM halo parameters are estimated.},

	abstract = {We have constructed an extended composite luminosity profile for the Andromeda galaxy, M31, and have decomposed it into three basic luminous structural components: a bulge, a disk, and a halo. The dust-free Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) imaging and extended spatial coverage of ground-based optical imaging and deep star counts allow us to map M31's structure from its center to 22 kpc along the major axis. We apply, and address the limitations of, different decomposition methods for the one-dimensional luminosity profiles and two-dimensional images. These methods include nonlinear least-squares and Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses. The basic photometric model for M31 has a Se´rsic bulge with shape index n 2.2 $\pm$ .3 and effective radius Re = 1.0 $\pm$ 0.2 kpc, and a dust-free exponential disk of scale length Rd = 5.3 $\pm$ .5 kpc; the parameter errors reflect the range between different decomposition methods. Despite model covariances, the convergence of solutions based on different methods and current data suggests a stable set of structural parameters. The ellipticities ( = 1 − b/a) of the bulge and the disk from the IRAC image are 0.37 $\pm$ 0.03 and 0.73 $\pm$ 0.03, respectively. The bulge parameter n is rather insensitive to bandpass effects and its value (2.2) suggests a first rapid formation via mergers followed by secular growth from the disk. The M31 halo has a two-dimensional power-law index −2.5 $\pm$ 0.2 (or −3.5 in three-dimensional), comparable to that of the Milky Way. We find that the M31 bulge light is mostly dominant over the range Rmin 1.2 kpc. The disk takes over in the range 1.2 kpc Rmin 9 kpc, whereas the halo dominates at Rmin 9 kpc. The stellar nucleus, bulge, disk, and halo components each contribute roughly 0.05\%, 23\%, 73\%, and 4\% of the total light of M31 out to 200 kpc along the minor axis. Nominal errors for the structural parameters of the M31 bulge, disk, and halo amount to 20\%. If M31 and the Milky Way are at all typical, faint stellar halos should be routinely detected in galaxy surveys reaching below μi 27 mag arcsec−2. We stress that our results rely on this photometric analysis alone. Structural parameters may change when other fundamental constraints, such as those provided by abundance gradients and stellar kinematics, are considered simultaneously.},

However, the results are controversial and no confirmation is obtained. In this article, we study the radio flux density profile of the M31 galaxy and show that it could manifest a possible signal of dark matter annihilation. By comparing the likelihoods between the archival observed radio flux density profile data and the predicted radio flux density profile contributed by dark matter and stellar emission, we can constrain the relevant dark matter parameters. Specifically, for the thermal annihilation cross section via the b¯b channel, the best-fit value of dark matter mass is ∼ 30 GeV, which is consistent with the results of many recent studies. We expect that this method would become another useful way to constrain dark matter, which is complementary to the traditional radio analyses and the other indirect detections.},

	abstract = {We discuss the often-neglected role of bremsstrahlung processes on the interstellar gas in computing indirect signatures of Dark Matter (DM) annihilation in the Galaxy, particularly for light DM candidates in the phenomenologically interesting O(10) GeV mass range. Especially from directions close to the Galactic Plane, the γ-ray spectrum is altered via two effects: directly, by the photons emitted in the bremsstrahlung process by energetic electrons which are among the DM annihilation byproducts; indirectly, by the modification of the same electron spectrum, due to the additional energy loss process in the diffusion-loss equation (e.g. the resulting inverse Compton emission is altered). We quantify the importance of the bremsstrahlung emission in the GeV energy range, showing that it is sometimes the dominant component of the γ-ray spectrum. We also find that, in regions in which bremsstrahlung dominates energy losses, the related γ-ray emission is only moderately sensitive to possible large variations in the gas density. Still, we stress that, for computing precise spectra in the (sub)GeV range, it is important to obtain a reliable description of the Galaxy gas distribution as well as to compute self-consistently the γ-ray emission and the solution to the diffusion-loss equation. For example, these are crucial issues to quantify and interpret meaningfully γ-ray map `residuals' in the inner Galaxy.},

	abstract = {A generic feature of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter models is the emission of photons over a broad energy band resulting from the stable yields of dark matter pair annihilation. Inverse Compton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons of energetic electrons and positrons produced in dark matter annihilation is expected to produce significant diffuse X-ray emission. Dwarf galaxies are ideal targets for this type of dark matter search technique, being nearby, dark matter dominated systems free of any astrophysical diffuse X-ray background. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of X-ray observations of local dwarf galaxies aimed at the search for WIMP dark matter. We outline the optimal energy and angular ranges for current telescopes, and analyze the systematic uncertainties connected to electron/positron diffusion. We do not observe any significant X-ray excess, and translate this null result into limits on the mass and pair annihilation cross section for particle dark matter. Our results indicate that X-ray observations of dwarf galaxies currently constrain dark matter models at the same level or even more strongly than gamma-ray observations of the same systems, although at the expenses of introducing additional assumptions and related uncertainties in the modeling of diffusion and energy loss processes. The limits we find constrain portions of the supersymmetric parameter space, particularly if the effect of dark matter substructures is included. Finally, we comment on the role of future X-ray satellites (e.g. Constellation-X, XEUS) and on their complementarity with GLAST and other gamma-ray telescopes in the quest for particle dark matter.},

	abstract = {Methods. The intensity of polarized synchrotron emission and its orientation are used to measure the orientations of the magnetic field components in the plane of the sky. The Faraday rotation measure gives information about the field components along the line of sight. With the Effelsberg 100-m telescope three deep radio continuum surveys of the Andromeda galaxy, M 31, were performed at 2.645, 4.85, and 8.35 GHz (wavelengths of 11.3, 6.2, and 3.6 cm). The λ3.6 cm survey is the first radio survey of M 31 at such small wavelengths. Maps of the Faraday rotation measures (RMs) are calculated from the distributions of the polarization angle.
Results. At all wavelengths the total and polarized emission is concentrated in a ring-like structure of about 7--13 kpc in radius from the centre. Propagation of cosmic rays away from the star-forming regions is evident. The ring of synchrotron emission is wider than the ring of the thermal radio emission, and the radial scale length of synchrotron emission is larger than that of thermal emission. The polarized intensity from the ring in the plane of the sky varies double-periodically with azimuthal angle, indicating that the ordered magnetic field is oriented almost along the ring, with a pitch angle of −14◦ $\pm$ 2◦ at λ6.2 cm. The RM varies systematically along the ring. The analysis shows a large-scale sinusoidal variation with azimuthal angle, signature of an axisymmetric spiral (AS S ) regular magnetic field, plus a superimposed double-periodic variation of a bisymmetric spiral (BS S ) regular field with about six times smaller amplitude. The RM amplitude of (118 $\pm$ 3) rad m−2 between λ6.2 cm and λ3.6 cm is about 50\% larger than between λ11.3 cm and λ6.2 cm, indicating that Faraday depolarization at λ11.3 cm is stronger (i.e. with a larger Faraday thickness) than at λ6.2 cm and λ3.6 cm. The phase of the sinusoidal RM variation of −7◦ $\pm$ 1◦ is interpreted as the average spiral pitch angle of the regular field. The average pitch angle of the ordered field, as derived from the intrinsic orientation of the polarized emission (corrected for Faraday rotation), is significantly smaller: −26◦ $\pm$ 3◦.
Conclusions. The dominating axisymmetric (ASS) plus the weaker bisymmetric (BSS) field of M 31 is the most compelling case so far of a field generated by the action of a mean-field dynamo. The difference in pitch angle of the regular and the ordered fields indicates that the ordered field contains a significant fraction of an anisotropic turbulent field that has a different pattern than the regular (AS S + BS S ) magnetic field.},

However, since H2-rich regions host significant star formation and numerous supernova remnants, the morphology of observed H2 gas should also provide a physically motivated, high-resolution tracer for cosmic-ray injection. We assess the impact of utilizing H2 as a tracer for cosmic-ray injection on models of diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission. We employ state-of-the-art 3D particle diffusion and gas density models, along with a physical model for the star-formation rate based on global Schmidt laws. Allowing a fraction, f\_H2, of cosmic-ray sources to trace the observed H2 density, we find that a theoretically well-motivated value f\_H2 {\textasciitilde} 0.20 -- 0.25 (i) provides a significantly better global fit to the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray sky and (ii) highly suppresses the intensity of the residual gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center region. Specifically, in models utilizing our best global fit values of f\_H2 {\textasciitilde} 0.20 -- 0.25, the spectrum of the galactic center gamma-ray excess is drastically affected, and the morphology of the excess becomes inconsistent with predictions for dark matter annihilation.},

We characterize the uncertainty of the GC excess spectrum and morphology due to uncertainties in cosmic-ray source distributions and propagation, uncertainties in the distribution of interstellar gas in the Milky Way, and uncertainties due to a potential contribution from the Fermi bubbles. We also evaluate uncertainties in the excess properties due to resolved point sources of gamma rays. The Galactic center is of particular interest as it would be expected to have the brightest signal from annihilation of weakly interacting massive dark matter particles. However, control regions along the Galactic plane, where a dark-matter signal is not expected, show excesses of similar amplitude relative to the local background. Based on the magnitude of the systematic uncertainties, we conservatively report upper limits for the annihilation cross section as function of particle mass and annihilation channel.},

	abstract = {The excess of \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ rays in the data measured by Fermi-LAT from the Galactic center region is one of the most intriguing mysteries in Astroparticle Physics. This Galactic center excess (GCE), has been measured with respect to different interstellar emission models (IEMs), source catalogs, data selections and techniques. Although several proposed interpretations have appeared in the literature, there are not firm conclusions as to its origin. The main difficulty in solving this puzzle lies in modeling a region of such complexity and thus precisely measuring the characteristics of the GCE. In this paper, we use 11 years of Fermi-LAT data, state of the art IEMs, and the newest 4FGL source catalog to provide precise measurements of the energy spectrum, spatial morphology, position, and sphericity of the GCE. We find that the GCE has a spectrum which is peaked at a few GeV and is well fit with a log-parabola. The normalization of the spectrum changes by roughly \$60{\textbackslash}\%\$ when using different IEMs, data selections and analysis techniques. The spatial distribution of the GCE is compatible with a dark matter (DM) template produced with a generalized NFW density profile with slope \${\textbackslash}gamma = 1.2-1.3\$. No energy evolution is measured for the GCE morphology between \$0.6-30\$ GeV at a level larger than \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ average value, which is 1.25. The analysis of the GCE modeled with a DM template divided into quadrants shows that the spectrum and spatial morphology of the GCE is similar in different regions around the Galactic center. Finally, the GCE centroid is compatible with the Galactic center, with best-fit position between \$l=[-0.3{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\},0.0{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}],b=[-0.1{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\},0.0{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}]\$, and it is compatible with a spherical symmetric morphology. In particular, fitting the DM spatial profile with an ellipsoid gives a major-to-minor axis ratio between 0.8-1.2.},

Identifying potential astrophysical sources that contribute to this excess is an important step in verifying whether the signal originates from annihilating dark matter. In this paper, we focus on the potential contribution of unresolved point sources, such as millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We propose that the statistics of the photons---in particular, the flux probability density function (PDF) of the photon counts below the point-source detection threshold---can potentially distinguish between the darkmatter and point-source interpretations. We calculate the flux PDF via the method of generating functions for these two models of the excess. Working in the framework of Bayesian model comparison, we then demonstrate that the flux PDF can potentially provide evidence for an unresolved MSP-like point-source population.},

	abstract = {The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) of GeV gamma rays can be explained as a signal of annihilating dark matter or of emission from unresolved astrophysical sources, such as millisecond pulsars. Evidence for the latter is provided by a statistical procedure---referred to as Non-Poissonian Template Fitting (NPTF)---that distinguishes the smooth distribution of photons expected for dark matter annihilation from a "clumpy" photon distribution expected for point sources. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of the NPTF on simulated data, exploring its ability to recover the flux and luminosity function of unresolved sources at the Galactic Center. When astrophysical background emission is perfectly modeled, we find that the NPTF successfully distinguishes between the dark matter and point source hypotheses when either component makes up the entirety of the GCE. When the GCE is a mixture of dark matter and point sources, the NPTF may fail to reconstruct the correct contribution of each component. We further study the impact of mismodeling the Galactic diffuse backgrounds, finding that while a dark matter signal could be attributed to point sources in some outlying cases for the scenarios we consider, the significance of a true point source signal remains robust. Our work enables us to comment on a recent study by Leane and Slatyer (2019) that questions prior NPTF conclusions because the method does not recover an artificial dark matter signal injected on actual Fermi data. We demonstrate that the failure of the NPTF to extract an artificial dark matter signal can be natural when point sources are present in the data---with the effect further exacerbated by the presence of diffuse mismodeling---and does not on its own invalidate the conclusions of the NPTF analysis in the Inner Galaxy.},

In a proof-of-principle example with simulated data, we discover that unmodeled sources in the Fermi Bubbles can lead to a dark matter signal being misattributed to point sources by the NPTF. We discover striking behavior consistent with a mismodeling effect in the real Fermi data, finding that large artificial injected dark matter signals are completely misattributed to point sources.

@article{2021arXiv211006931M,
	abstract = {The nature of the Fermi gamma-ray Galactic Center Excess (GCE) has remained a persistent mystery for over a decade. Although the excess is broadly compatible with emission expected due to dark matter annihilation, an explanation in terms of a population of unresolved astrophysical point sources e.g., millisecond pulsars, remains viable. The effort to uncover the origin of the GCE is hampered in particular by an incomplete understanding of diffuse emission of Galactic origin. This can lead to spurious features that make it difficult to robustly differentiate smooth emission, as expected for a dark matter origin, from more "clumpy" emission expected for a population of relatively bright, unresolved point sources. We use recent advancements in the field of simulation-based inference, in particular density estimation techniques using normalizing flows, in order to characterize the contribution of modeled components, including unresolved point source populations, to the GCE. Compared to traditional techniques based on the statistical distribution of photon counts, our machine learning-based method is able to utilize more of the information contained in a given model of the Galactic Center emission, and in particular can perform posterior parameter estimation while accounting for pixel-to-pixel spatial correlations in the gamma-ray map. This makes the method demonstrably more resilient to certain forms of model misspecification. On application to Fermi data, the method generically attributes a smaller fraction of the GCE flux to unresolved point sources when compared to traditional approaches. We nevertheless infer such a contribution to make up a non-negligible fraction of the GCE across all analysis variations considered, with at least \$38{\textasciicircum}\{+9\}\_\{-19\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the excess attributed to unresolved points sources in our baseline analysis.},

	abstract = {The Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT, hereafter LAT), the primary instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) mission, is an imaging, wide field-of-view, high-energy γ-ray telescope, covering the energy range from below 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. The LAT was built by an international collaboration with contributions from space agencies, high-energy particle physics institutes, and universities in France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. This paper describes the LAT, its pre-flight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4 × 4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 x, y tracking planes, including two layers (x and y) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an 8 layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths, giving both longitudinal and transverse information about the energy deposition pattern. The calorimeter's depth and segmentation enable the highenergy reach of the LAT and contribute significantly to background rejection. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4, allowing a large field-of-view (2.4 sr) and ensuring that most pair-conversion showers initiated in the tracker will pass into the calorimeter for energy measurement. Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (i) permit rapid notification of high-energy γ-ray bursts (GRBs) and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (ii) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (iii) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (iv) localize point sources to 0.3 -- 2 arc minutes, (v) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (vi) measure the diffuse isotropic γ-ray background up to TeV energies, and (vii) explore the discovery space for dark matter.},

	abstract = {Methods. We combined observations taken with the VLA at 3.6 cm and 6.2 cm with data from the Effelsberg 100-m telescope to fill the missing spacings of the synthesis data. The resulting polarization maps were averaged in sectors to analyse the azimuthal behaviour of the polarized intensity (PI), rotation measure (RM), and apparent pitch angle (φobs). We developed a simplified 3-D model for the magnetic field in the central region to explain the azimuthal behaviour of the three observables.
Results. Our 3-D model of a quadrupolar or dipolar dynamo field can explain the observed patterns in PI, RM, and φobs, while a 2-D configuration is not sufficient to explain the azimuthal behaviour. In addition and independent of our model, the RM pattern shows that the spiral magnetic field in the inner 0.5 kpc points outward, which is opposite to that in the outer disk, and has a pitch angle of ≃ 33◦, which is much larger than that of 8◦ − 19◦ in the outer disk.
Conclusions. The physical conditions in the central region differ significantly from those in the 10 kpc ring. In addition, the orientation of this region with respect to the outer disk is completely different. The opposite magnetic field directions suggest that the central region is decoupled from the outer disk, and we propose that an independent dynamo is active in the central region.},

	abstract = {The configuration of the regular magnetic field in M 31 is deduced from radio polarization observations at the wavelengths λλ 6, 11 and 20 cm. By fitting the observed azimuthal distribution of polarization angles, we find that the regular magnetic field, averaged over scales 1--3 kpc, is almost perfectly axisymmetric in the radial range 8 to 14 kpc, and follows a spiral pattern with pitch angles of p ≃ −19◦ to p ≃ −8◦. In the ring between 6 and 8 kpc a perturbation of the dominant axisymmetric mode may be present, having the azimuthal wave number m = 2. A systematic analysis of the observed depolarization allows us to identify the main mechanism for wavelength dependent depolarization -- Faraday rotation measure gradients arising in a magneto-ionic screen above the synchrotron disk. Modelling of the depolarization leads to constraints on the relative scale heights of the thermal and synchrotron emitting layers in M 31; the thermal layer is found to be up to three times thicker than the synchrotron disk. The regular magnetic field must be coherent over a vertical scale at least similar to the scale height of the thermal layer, estimated to be hth ≃ 1 kpc. Faraday effects offer a powerful method to detect thick magneto-ionic disks or halosaround spiral galaxies.},

@article{2011ApJ...729..106T,
	abstract = {Research in many areas of modern physics such as, e.g., indirect searches for dark matter and particle acceleration in SNR shocks, rely heavily on studies of cosmic rays (CRs) and associated diffuse emissions (radio, microwave, X-rays, γ-rays). While very detailed numerical models of CR propagation exist, a quantitative statistical analysis of such models has been so far hampered by the large computational effort that those models require. Although statistical analyses have been carried out before using semi-analytical models (where the computation is much faster), the evaluation of the results obtained from such models is difficult, as they necessarily suffer from many simplifying assumptions, The main objective of this paper is to present a working method for a full Bayesian parameter estimation for a numerical CR propagation model. For this study, we use the GALPROP code, the most advanced of its kind, that uses astrophysical information, nuclear and particle data as input to self-consistently predict CRs, γ-rays, synchrotron and other observables. We demonstrate that a full Bayesian analysis is possible using nested sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (implemented in the SuperBayeS code) despite the heavy computational demands of a numerical propagation code. The best-fit values of parameters found in this analysis are in agreement with previous, significantly simpler, studies also based on GALPROP.},

	abstract = {We report improved measurements of elemental abundances and spectra for galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) nuclei obtained by the Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer on board NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft during the minimum and maximum phases of solar cycle 23. We discuss results for particles with nuclear charge 5 \&lt;= Z \&lt;= 28 and typical energies between 50 and 500 MeV nucleon{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We demonstrate that a detailed "leaky box" Galactic propagation model combined with a spherically symmetric solar modulation model gives a good (but not perfect) fit to the observed spectra by using a solar modulation parameter of phi = 325 MV at solar minimum and phi = 900 MV at solar maximum. Although our results are generally consistent with previous measurements from space-based and balloon-based missions, there are significant differences. The large geometrical acceptance and excellent charge resolution of the instrument result in the most detailed and statistically significant record of GCR composition to date in this energy range. The measurements reported here serve as a high-precision baseline for continued studies of GCR composition, solar modulation over the solar cycle, space radiation hazards, and other applications.},

We also report an upper limit on the abundance of GCR 14C. The high statistical significance of these measurements allows the energy dependence of their relative abundances to be studied. A steady-state, leaky-box propagation model, incorporating observations of the local interstellar medium (ISM) composition and density and recent partial fragmentation cross section measurements, is used to interpret these abundances. Using this model, the individual galactic confinement times derived using data for each species are consistent with a unique confinement time value of τesc=15.0+/-1.6 Myr. The CRIS abundance measurements are consistent with propagation through an average ISM hydrogen number density nH=0.34+/-0.04 H atoms cm-3. The surviving fractions, f, for each radioactive species have been calculated. From predictions of the diffusion models of Ptuskin \& Soutoul, the values of f indicate an interstellar cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient of D=(3.5+/-2.0)×1028 cm2 s-1.},

	abstract = {A new study of the diffuse Galactic γ-ray continuum radiation is presented, using a cosmic-ray propagation model which includes nucleons, antiprotons, electrons, positrons, and synchrotron radiation. Our treatment of the inverse Compton scattering includes the effect of anisotropic scattering in the Galactic interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and a new evaluation of the ISRF itself. Models based on locally measured electron and nucleon spectra and synchrotron constraints are consistent with γ-ray measurements in the 30--500 MeV range, but outside this range excesses are apparent. A harder nucleon spectrum is considered but fitting to γ-rays causes it to violate limits from positrons and antiprotons. A harder interstellar electron spectrum allows the γ-ray spectrum to be fitted above 1 GeV as well, and this can be further improved when combined with a modified nucleon spectrum which still respects the limits imposed by antiprotons and positrons.},

The radio radiation must be due to synchrotron by relativistic electrons, and the inverse Compton (IC) scattering by the cosmic microwave background radiation of the same electrons is the most natural source for the HXR and perhaps the EUV emissions. However, simple estimates give a weaker magnetic field than that suggested by Faraday rotation measurements. Consequently, non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) and TB have also been suggested as sources of these emissions.},

@article{hamiltonStochasticAccelerationElectrons1992,
	abstract = {Stochastic acceleration of thermal electrons to nonrelativistic energies is studied under solar flare conditions. We show that, in turbulent regions, electron-whistler wave interactions can result in the acceleration of electrons in times comparable to or shorter than the Coulomb collision time. The kinetic equation describing the evolution of the electron energy distribution including stochastic acceleration by whistlers and energy loss via Coulomb interactions is solved for an initial thermal electron energy spectrum. In general, the shape of the resulting electron distributions are characterized by the energy E(c) where systematic energy gain by turbulence equals energy loss due to Coulomb collisions. For energies less than E(c), the spectra are steep (quasi-thermal) whereas above E(c), the spectra are power laws. We find that hard X-ray spectra computed using the electron distributions obtained from our numerical simulations are able to explain the complex spectral shapes and variations observed in impulsive hard X-ray bursts. In particular, we show that the gradual steepening observed by Lin et al. (1981) could be due to a systematic increase in the density of the plasma (due to evaporation) and the increasing importance of collisions instead of the appearance of a superhot thermal component.},

Its 21-cm emission line is a key probe of the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way Galaxy. About 50 years after the first detection of the 21-cm line the exploration of the Hi distribution of the Milky Way has undergone a true renaissance. This was triggered by several large-scale 21-cm surveys that became available within the past decade. New all-sky surveys unravel the shape and volume density distribution of the gaseous disk up to its borders. High-resolution Galactic plane surveys disclose a wealth of shells, filaments, and spurs that bear witness to the recycling of matter between stars and the ISM. All these observational results indicate that the Hi gas traces a dynamical Galactic ISM with structures on all scales, from tens of astronomical units to kiloparsecs. The Galaxy can be considered to be a violent, breathing disk surrounded by highly turbulent extra-planar gas.},

	abstract = {We have undertaken a deep, wide-field H I imaging survey of M31, reaching a maximum resolution of about 50 pc and 2 km s−1 across a 95×48 kpc region. The H I mass and brightness sensitivity at 100 pc resolution for a 25 km s−1 wide spectral feature is 1500 M⊙ and 0.28 K. Our study reveals ubiquitous H I self-opacity features, discernible in the first instance as filamentary local minima in images of the peak H I brightness temperature. Local minima are organized into complexes of more than kpc length and are particularly associated with the leading edge of spiral arm features. Just as in the Galaxy, there is only patchy correspondence of self-opaque features with CO(1-0) emission. We have produced images of the best-fit physical parameters; spin temperature, opacity-corrected column density and non-thermal velocity dispersion, for the brightest spectral feature along each line-of-sight in the M31 disk. Spectroscopically opaque atomic gas is organized into filamentary complexes and isolated clouds down to 100 pc. Localized opacity corrections to the column density exceed an order of magnitude in many cases and add globally to a 30\% increase in the atomic gas mass over that inferred from the integrated brightness under the usual assumption of negligible self-opacity. Opaque atomic gas first increases from 20 to 60 K in spin temperature with radius to 12 kpc but then declines again to 20 K beyond 25 kpc. We have extended the resolved star formation law down to physical scales more than an order of magnitude smaller in area and mass than has been possible previously. The relation between total-gas-mass- and star-formation-rate-density is significantly tighter than that with molecularmass and is fully consistent in both slope and normalization with the power law index of 1.56 found in the molecule-dominated disk of M51 at 500 pc resolution. Below a gas-mass-density of about 5 M⊙pc−2, there is a down-turn in star-formation-rate-density which may represent a real local threshold for massive star formation at a cloud mass of about 5·104 M⊙.},

The molecular front appears at galacto-centric distance of R ∼ 8 kpc, where the phase transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen occurs suddenly with fmρ ol dropping from ∼ 0.8 to 0.2 within a radial interval as narrow as ∼ 0.5 kpc. The front in density fmρ ol is much sharper than that for surface density molecular fraction. The front also appears in the vertical direction with a full width of the high-fmρ ol disk to be ∼ 100 pc. The radial and vertical fmρ ol profiles, particularly the front behaviors, are well fitted by theoretical curves calculated using the observed density profile and assumed radiation field and metallicity with exponential gradients. The molecular fraction was found to be enhanced along the Perseus and some other spiral arms. The fmol arms imply that the molecular clouds are produced from HI gas in the spiral arms and are dissociated in the interarm region.

	abstract = {In order to draw statistical conclusions about the overall population of pulsars in the Galaxy, the authors have analysed a sample of 316 pulsars detected in surveys carried out at Jodrell Bank, Arecibo, Molonglo, and Green Bank. They quantify the important selection effects of each survey, and describe a statistically reliable pulsar distance scale. The authors conclude that the Galaxy contains approximately 70000 potentially observable pulsars with luminosities above 0.3 mJy kpc2. The distribution in galactocentric radius rises smoothly through the solar location towards the galactic centre and peaks inside 6 kpc. The galactic z distribution has a scale height of about 400 pc, much larger than that of the OB stars from which pulsars form. The authors then consider the period and luminosity evolution of pulsars.},

@article{1994ApJ...431..156W,
	abstract = {We present a study of diffuse ionized gas (DIG, or WIM for warm ionized medium) in the nearby spiral M31, based on CCD imagery in Hα and [S II] emission lines. We find that the DIG in M31 contributes 40\% of the observed total Hα luminosity, and at least 20\% of the total after correction for extinction. This fraction is constant across the disk of M31. The total Hα luminosity of M31, corrected for extinction, is about 4.1 x 10{\textasciicircum}40{\textasciicircum} ergs s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}. This implies a low star formation rate of about 0.35 M\_sun\_ yr{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}, in agreement with earlier estimates. DIG is concentrated near regions of star formation. The average emission measure (EM) perpendicular to the disk ranges from about 6 pc cm{\textasciicircum}-6{\textasciicircum} in weaker spiral arms to 15 pc cm{\textasciicircum}-6{\textasciicircum} in the main spiral arms, with (rare) peak values reaching 50 pc cm{\textasciicircum}-6{\textasciicircum}. Overall, the EM in the main arms is substantially higher than that of DIG in the solar neighborhood, implying higher power requirements per unit area in these regions of M31. However, the strong concentration of DIG near regions of star formation keeps the total area covered by DIG in M31 relatively small, which makes it possible to sustain this gas in spite of the low star formation rate. We argue that the DIG extent in vertical direction in M31 may well be lower than in our Galaxy, because of its low star formation rate. A simple parameterization of the electron distribution then shows that the DIG in the spiral arms may contribute between 15\% and 40\% of the total atomic gas column. The average electron densities implied by the high EMs reached in some regions seem to indicate a higher thermal pressure in the DIG than in the diffuse H I gas in M31. This pressure in-equilibrium can be avoided if part of the diffuse emission is due to a denser component, as proposed most recently by Miller \& Cox, because this would reduce the EM and implied pressures for the actual widespread DIG. Column densities of the ionized gas might then be lower as well. We also show, however, that it is not possible to attribute all of the diffuse emission to a relatively dense component, such as earlier proposed extended low-density H II regions. The DIG in M31 shows an overall [S II]/Hα intensity ratio of 0.5, significantly higher than in discrete H II regions, and similar to that in other galaxies. This number does not vary with radius in M31. There is a suggestion that [S II]/Hα intensity ratios may be higher at the lowest detectable emission measures, up to 0.7 or even 1. The discrete source population in M31 also shows a trend toward increasing [S II]/Hα flux ratios as the sources become more diffuse. Few sources (apart from supernova remnants), however, reach the value of 0.5 found in the DIG as a whole. The distinct spectral signature of the DIG in M31, and its energy requirements favor photoionization of the gas, although it is likely that shock ionization occurs in selected regions.},

	abstract = {The stopping power of a plasma for fast electrons and positrons is calculated. First the classical limit is considered where β = ν/ c ≪ α is the fine structure constant. Then the nonrelativistic Born-approximation formulas are derived; this domain corresponds to α ≪ β ≪ 1. Finally the general case of relativistic electrons and positrons is treated; in the relativistic case the scattering cross sections of M{\o}ller (electron-electron) and Bhabha (positron-electron) are used in the calculation. In all three energy domains the problem is broken up into cases of small and large momentum transfers ( ℏq). For large q, scattering off individual plasma electrons is considered, while in the limit of very small q for the quantum-mechanical domain, excitation of quantized plasma oscillations contributes to d E/d x; in the classical limit for small q (or large impact parameter), the polarizability of the plasma provides the effective cutoff. The formulas for the stopping power differ slightly from those for a heavy ion going through a plasma because (i) there are exchange effects and (ii) the fast electrons and positrons can lose a large fraction of their energy in one scattering off a plasma electron.},

Optical and synchrotron polarization data yield a strength of the local regular field of {\textbackslash}simeq 4{\textbackslash}muG (an upper limit if anisotropic fields are present), while pulsar rotation measures give {\textbackslash}simeq 1.5{\textbackslash}muG (a lower limit if small-scale fluctuations in regular field strength and in thermal electron density are anticorrelated). In spiral arms of external galaxies, the total [regular] field strength is up to {\textbackslash}simeq 35{\textbackslash}muG [{\textbackslash}simeq 15{\textbackslash}muG]. In nuclear starburst regions the total field reaches {\textbackslash}simeq 50{\textbackslash}muG. Little is known about the global field structure in the Milky Way. The local regular field may be part of a ``magnetic arm'' between the optical arms, a feature that is known from other spiral galaxies. Unlike external galaxies, rotation measure data indicate several global field reversals in the Milky Way, but some of these could be due to field distortions. The Galaxy is surrounded by a thick radio disk of similar extent as around many edge-on spiral galaxies. While the regular field of the local disk is of even symmetry with respect to the plane (quadrupole), the regular field in the inner Galaxy or in the halo may be of dipole type. The Galactic center region hosts highly regular fields of up to milligauss strength which are oriented perpendicular to the plane.},

@article{2012SSRv..166..215B,
	abstract = {Radio synchrotron emission, its polarization and its Faraday rotation are powerful tools to study the strength and structure of magnetic fields in galaxies. Unpolarized emission traces turbulent fields which are strongest in spiral arms and bars (20-30 μG) and in central starburst regions (50-100 μG). Such fields are dynamically important, e.g. they can drive gas inflows in central regions. Polarized emission traces ordered fields which can be regular or anisotropic random, generated from isotropic random fields by compression or shear. The strongest ordered fields of 10-15 μG strength are generally found in interarm regions and follow the orientation of adjacent gas spiral arms. Ordered fields with spiral patterns exist in grand-design, barred and flocculent galaxies, and in central regions of starburst galaxies. Faraday rotation measures (RM) of the diffuse polarized radio emission from the disks of several spiral galaxies reveal large-scale patterns, which are signatures of regular fields generated by a mean-field dynamo. However, in most spiral galaxies observed so far the field structure is more complicated. Ordered fields in interacting galaxies have asymmetric distributions and are an excellent tracer of past interactions between galaxies or with the intergalactic medium. Ordered magnetic fields are also observed in radio halos around edge-on galaxies, out to large distances from the plane, with X-shaped patterns. Future observations of polarized emission at high frequencies, with the EVLA, the SKA and its precursors, will trace galactic magnetic fields in unprecedented detail. Low-frequency telescopes (e.g. LOFAR and MWA) are ideal to search for diffuse emission and small RMs from weak interstellar and intergalactic fields.},

	abstract = {The amplitude of the magnetic field near the Galactic Centre has been uncertain by two orders of magnitude for several decades. On a scale of {\textasciitilde}100 parsecs (pc), fields of {\textasciitilde}1,000 microgauss (μG refs 1-3) have been reported, implying a magnetic energy density more than 10,000 times stronger than typical for the Galaxy. Alternatively, the assumption of pressure equilibrium between the various phases of the Galactic Centre interstellar medium (including turbulent molecular gas, the contested `very hot' plasma, and the magnetic field) suggests fields of {\textasciitilde}100 μG over {\textasciitilde}400 pc size scales. Finally, assuming equipartition, fields of only {\textasciitilde}6 μG have been inferred from radio observations for 400 pc scales. Here we report a compilation of previous data that reveals a downward break in the region's non-thermal radio spectrum (attributable to a transition from bremsstrahlung to synchrotron cooling of the in situ cosmic-ray electron population). We show that the spectral break requires that the Galactic Centre field be at least {\textasciitilde}50 μG on 400 pc scales, lest the synchrotron-emitting electrons produce too much γ-ray emission, given other existing constraints. Other considerations support a field of 100 μG, implying that over 10\% of the Galaxy's magnetic energy is contained in only {\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.05\% of its volume.},

Observational data of magnetic fields in the halo of the Milky Way are scarce, and non-conclusive about the large-scale structure of the field. In external galaxies, various large-scale configurations of magnetic fields are measured, but many uncertainties about exact configurations and their origin remain. There is a strong interaction between magnetic fields and other components in the interstellar medium such as ionized and neutral gas and cosmic rays.

The total number of certain and probable Group members presently stands at 35. The half-mass radius of the Local Group is found to be R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} h{\textasciitilde} 350 kpc. The zero-velocity surface, which separates the Local Group from the field that is expanding with the Hubble flow, has a radius R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} o = 1.18+/- 0.15 Mpc.

Most of this mass appears to be concentrated in the Andromeda and Milky Way subgroups of the LG. The total luminosity of the Local Group is found to be M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} V = -22.0:. This yields a mass-to-light ratio (in solar units) of M/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} V = 44+/- 12. The solar motion with respect to the LG is 306+/- 18 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, directed towards an apex at l = 99{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}o{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}+/- 5{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}o{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, and b = -4{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}o{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}+/- 4{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}o{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The velocity dispersion within the LG is σ {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} r = 61+/- 8 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The galaxies NGC 3109, Antlia, Sextans A and Sextans B appear to form a distinct grouping with V{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} r = +114+/- 12 kpc relative to the LG, that is located beyond the LG zero-velocity surface at a distance of 1.7 Mpc from the Local Group centroid. The luminosity distribution of the LG has a slope α = -1.1+/- 0.1. This value is significantly less negative than that which is found in rich clusters of galaxies. The luminosity distribution of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies is steeper than that for dwarf irregulars. Furthermore the dSph galaxies are strongly concentrated within the Andromeda and Milky Way subclusters of the Local Group, whereas the majority of dIr galaxies appear to be free-floating members of the LG as a whole. With the possible exception of Leo I and Leo A, most LG members appear to have started forming stars simultaneously {\textasciitilde} 15 Gyr ago. Many of the galaxies, for which evolutionary data are available, appear to have shrunk with time. This result is unexpected because Hubble Space Telescope observations appear to show galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 3 to be smaller than they are at z = 0. In the Large Magellanic Cloud the rate of cluster formation was low for a period that extended from {\textasciitilde} 12 Gyr to {\textasciitilde} 4 Gyr ago. The rate of cluster formation may have increased more rapidly 3-5 Gyr ago, than did the rate of star formation. The reason for the sudden burst of cluster formation in the LMC {\textasciitilde} 4 Gyr ago remains obscure. None of the dwarf galaxies in the LG appears to have experienced a starburst strong enough to have produced a ``boojum''.},

	abstract = {Neutral hydrogen (H i) absorption and deduced emission detected along seven lines of sight through the disk of M31 are analyzed in parallel with published data for the Galaxy. It is shown that the brightness temperature of H i emission is coupled to the opacity of the gas. The Galactic relationship shows asymptotic trends at both large and small opacities. A simple yet effective physical model which accounts for this behavior consists of only two independent components: a high-opacity, cool component of fixed mean temperature, and a low-opacity, warm component of fixed mean brightness. The fitted asymptotic values not only provide a good representation of the data but also are consistent with the much more general constraints imposed by the maximum observed brightness of H i emission and the `` threshold '' effect of finding detectable absorption whenever the emission brightness exceeds about 5 K. The warm component of H i in the Galaxy is responsible for a mean brightness of about 4 K. The limited data at low opacity in M31 are consistent with this value. The cool Galactic component (in the extended solar neighborhood) has a mean temperature of 105 K, while a radial dependence of gas temperature is observed in M31. Cool-component temperatures in M31 appear to vary from about 70 K at radii between 5 and 10 kpc to about 175 K in the outer disk (10-20 kpc). Intrinsic temperature variations by about a factor of 2 around these mean values are implied by the data.},

The most well-known use of this framework is for the combined search for the Higgs boson at LEP. A toy neutrino oscillations experiment is used to illustrate the rich information available in the framework for exclusion and discovery. I argue that the so-called CLs technique for setting limits is appropriate for determining exclusion intervals while the determination of confidence intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins' method is more appropriate for treating established signals, i.e. going beyond discovery to measurement.

	abstract = {Using data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, a spatially extended component of gamma rays has been identified from the direction of the Galactic Center, peaking at energies of {\textasciitilde}2-3 GeV. More recently, it has been shown that this signal is not confined to the innermost hundreds of parsecs of the Galaxy, but instead extends to at least {\textasciitilde}3 kpc from the Galactic Center. While the spectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good agreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been suggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be responsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy. In this paper, we consider this later possibility in detail. Comparing the observed spectral shape of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess to the spectrum measured from 37 millisecond pulsars by Fermi, we find that these sources exhibit a spectral shape that is much too soft at sub-GeV energies to accommodate this signal. We also construct population models to describe the spatial distribution and luminosity function of the Milky Way's millisecond pulsars. After taking into account constraints from the observed distribution of Fermi sources (including both sources known to be millisecond pulsars, and unidentified sources which could be pulsars), we find that millisecond pulsars can account for no more than {\textasciitilde}10\% of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess. Each of these arguments strongly disfavor millisecond pulsars as the source of this signal.},

	abstract = {The present work derived the robust constraints on annihilating WIMP parameters utilizing new radio observations of M31, as well as new studies of its dark matter distribution and other properties. The characteristics of emission due to DM annihilation were computed in the frame of 2D galactic model employing GALPROP code adapted specifically for M31. This enabled to refine various inaccuracies of previous studies on the subject. DM constraints were obtained for two representative annihilation channels: \${\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}chi {\textbackslash}rightarrow b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}chi {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}-\$. A wide variety of radio data was utilized in the frequency range \${\textbackslash}approx\$(0.1-10) GHz. As the result the thermal WIMP lighter than \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 72 GeV for \$b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\}\$ channel and \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 39 GeV for \${\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}+{\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}-\$ was excluded. The corresponding mass threshold uncertainty ranges were estimated to be 20-210 GeV and 18-89 GeV. The obtained exclusions are competitive to those from Fermi-LAT observations of dwarfs and AMS-02 measurements of antiprotons. Our constraints does not exclude the explanation of the gamma-ray outer halo of M31 and Galactic center excess by annihilating DM. The thermal WIMP with \$m\_x {\textbackslash}approx 70\$ GeV, which explains the outer halo, would make a significant contribution into the non-thermal radio flux in M31 nucleus fitting well both the spectrum and morphology. And finally we questioned the possibility to robustly constrain heavy thermal WIMP with \$m\_x {\textgreater} 100\$ GeV by radio data on M31 claimed in other studies.},

	abstract = {The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope has provided evidence for diffuse gamma-ray emission in the central parts of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. This excess has been interpreted either as dark-matter annihilation emission or as emission from thousands of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We have recently shown that old massive globular clusters (GCs) may move toward the center of the Galaxy by dynamical friction and carry within them enough MSPs to account for the observed gamma-ray excess. In this Letter we revisit the MSP scenario for the Andromeda galaxy by modeling the formation and disruption of its GC system. We find that our model predicts gamma-ray emission ∼2-3 times larger than for the Milky Way, but still nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the observed Fermi excess in the Andromeda. Our MSP model can reproduce the observed excess only by assuming ∼8 times a larger number of old clusters than inferred from galaxy scaling relations. To explain the observations we require either that Andromeda deviates significantly from the scaling relations, or that a large part of its high-energy emission comes from additional sources.},

	abstract = {A new measurement of a spatially extended gamma-ray signal from the center of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) has recently been published by the Fermi-LAT collaboration, reporting that the emission broadly resembles the so-called Galactic center excess (GCE) of the Milky Way (MW). The weight of the evidence is steadily accumulating on a millisecond pulsar (MSPs) origin for the GCE. These elements prompt us to compare these observations with what is, perhaps, the simplest model for an MSP population, which is solely obtained by rescaling of the MSP luminosity function that is determined in the local MW disk via the respective stellar mass of the systems. Remarkably, we find that without free fitting parameters, this model can account for both the energetics and the morphology of the GCE within uncertainties. For M31, the estimated luminosity due to primordial MSPs is expected to only contribute about a quarter of the detected emission, although a stronger contribution cannot be excluded given the large uncertainties. If correct, the model predicts that the M31 disk emission due to MSPs is not far below the present upper bound. We also discuss additional refinements of this simple model. Using the correlation between globular cluster gamma-ray luminosity and stellar encounter rate, we gauge the dynamical MSP formation in the bulge. This component is expected to contribute to the GCE only at a level of ≲5\%, it could affect the signal's morphology. We also comment on the limitations of our model and on future perspectives for improved diagnostics.},

	abstract = {The kinematic signature of spiral arm segments in the highly inclined gaseous disk of M31 is identified within previously published data bases of neutral hydrogen emission. These features are tabulated to give a complete spatial and kinematic parameterization of the neutral gas distribution. Neither a fixed inclination nor a fully axisymmetric velocity field were assumed in the analysis. Significant variations in the local orientation are derived, including a systematic departure of the inner (2 kpc) disk to an orientation tilted by 15{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} with respect to the outer disk. The spatial distribution of gas is very well described by a global two-arm trailing spiral. The spiral in the inner 5 kpc has an elliptical distortion with an axial ratio of about 1.9 which is coaligned with the long axis of the apparently triaxial stellar bulge. Between 5.4 and 16.3 kpc the spiral pattern is logarithmic with pitch angle 6.7{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum}. Beyond 17 kpc the two spiral arms merge into a single structure. The rotation curve, after correction for the inner ellipticity, is well fitted with just two mass components: a stellar bulge and disk with mass distributions which are traced by the blue light. A total mass M = (2.0 +/- 0.1) x 10{\textasciicircum}11{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_ is found within 28 kpc. Ratios of mass to blue luminosity for both the bulge and disk are 6.5 M\_sun\_/L\_sun\_. There is no evidence for additional mass with a more uniform spatial distribution out to 28 kpc. Identifying the two boundaries of the range in radius over which the spiral is logarithmic with (1) the inner Lindblad resonance and (2) corotation leads to a pattern speed of 15 +/- 2 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} kpc{\textasciicircum}- l{\textasciicircum} and a predicted outer Lindblad resonance at 22 kpc, where the two arms are observed to merge. The most obvious driver of the spiral pattern seems to be M32, which may also be responsible for many of the departures from a planar distribution as well as significant asymmetries in rotation velocity between 12 and 16 kpc radius. The radial dependence of gas scale height is found to be roughly linear, extending from about 200 pc at 5 kpc radius to about 600 pc at 25 kpc.},

	abstract = {Cosmological simulations predict that an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) pervades the large scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. Measuring the IGMF is important to determine its origin (i.e. primordial or otherwise). Using data from the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), we present the Faraday rotation measure (RM) and depolarisation properties of the giant radio galaxy J1235+5317, at a redshift of z = 0.34 and 3.38 Mpc in size. We find a mean RM difference between the lobes of 2.5 $\pm$ 0.1 rad m{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, in addition to small scale RM variations of ∼0.1 rad m{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} . From a catalogue of LSS filaments based on optical spectroscopic observations in the local universe, we find an excess of filaments intersecting the line of sight to only one of the lobes. Associating the entire RM difference to these LSS filaments leads to a gas density-weighted IGMF strength of ∼0.3 μG. However, direct comparison with cosmological simulations of the RM contribution from LSS filaments gives a low probability (∼5\%) for an RM contribution as large as 2.5 rad m{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, for the case of IGMF strengths of 10-50 nG. It is likely that variations in the RM from the Milky Way (on 11' scales) contribute significantly to the mean RM difference, and a denser RM grid is required to better constrain this contribution. In general, this work demonstrates the potential of the LOFAR telescope to probe the weak signature of the IGMF. Future studies, with thousands of sources with high accuracy RMs from LoTSS, will enable more stringent constraints on the nature of the IGMF.},

We apply the galactic model developed in Tempel et al. (2010, A\&amp;A, 509, A91) and far-infrared imaging to correct the photometry for intrinsic dust effects. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We obtain observed and dust-corrected distributions of the surface brightness of M 31 and a map of line-of-sight extinctions inside the galaxy. Our extinction model suggests that either M 31 is intrinsically non-symmetric along the minor axis or the dust properties differ from those of the Milky Way. Assuming the latter case, we present the surface brightness distributions and integral photometry for the Sloan filters as well as the standard UBVRI system. We find the following intrinsic integral colour indices for M 31: (U-B)\_0 = 0.35; (B-V)\_0 = 0.86; (V-R)\_0 = 0.63; (R-I)\_0 = 0.53; the total intrinsic absorption-corrected luminosities of M 31 in the B and the V filters are 4.10 and 3.24 mag, respectively.},

Since the compilation of Frail \& Weisberg, there are 35 pulsars with new distance estimates and 25 pulsars for which the distance or distance uncertainty have been revised. We used this data to fit a smooth, axisymmetric, two-disk model of the distribution of Galactic electrons. The two exponential model components have mean local midplane densities at the solar circle of 2.03×10-2 and 0.71×10-2 cm-3, and scale heights of 1.07 and 0.053 kpc. The thick component shows very little radial variation, while the second has a radial scale length of only a few kiloparsecs. We also examined a model that varies as sech2x, rather than exp(-x), in both the radial and vertical directions. We prefer this model with no midplane cusp but find that the fit parameters essentially describe the same electron distribution. The distances predicted by this distribution have a similar scatter to that produced by the more complex model of Taylor \& Cordes. We examine the pulsars that deviate strongly from this model. There are two regions of enhanced dispersion measure, one of which correlates well with the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm. We find that the scatter of the observed dispersion measure from the model is not fitted well by either a normal or a lognormal distribution of lump sizes but may be caused instead by the uncertainties in the distances.},

When expressed in terms of the corresponding disk scale lengths, we show that the observed radial profiles of MW and M 31 exhibit interesting similarities, suggesting the possibility of a description within a common framework. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: We find that the profiles of stars, gas fraction, and metallicity of the two galaxies, as well as most of their global properties, are well described by our model, provided that the star formation efficiency in M 31 disk is twice as high as in the MW. We show that the star formation rate profile of M 31 cannot be described by any form of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (KS Law) for star formation. We propose that these discrepancies are caused by the fact that M 31 has an active star formation history in the recent past, consistent with the hypotheses of a ``head-on'' collision with the neighboring galaxy (most probably M 32) about 200 Myr ago. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: The MW has most probably experienced quiescent secular evolution, making possible a fairly successful description with a simple model. If M 31 is more typical of spiral galaxies, more complex models, involving galaxy interactions, will be required for the description of spirals.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of 68 classical Cepheids, most detected from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope POMME Survey, with periods from 10 to 78 days observed in the near-infrared by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury Program using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The combination of HST's resolution and the use of near-infrared measurements provide a dramatic reduction in the dispersion of the period-luminosity relation over the present optical, ground-based data. Even using random phase magnitudes we measure a dispersion of just 0.17 mag, implying a dispersion of just 0.12 mag for mean magnitudes. The error in the mean for this relation is 1\% in distance. Combined with similar observations of Cepheids in other hosts and independent distance determinations, we measure a distance to M31 of μ0 = 24.38 $\pm$ 0.06(statistical) $\pm$ 0.03(systematic), 752 $\pm$ 27 kpc, in good agreement with past measurements though with a better, 3\% precision here. The result is also in good agreement with independent distance determinations from two detached eclipsing binaries allowing for an independent calibration of the Cepheid luminosities and a determination of the Hubble constant. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	abstract = {We have obtained Johnson V and Gunni photometry for a large number of Local Group galaxies using the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera (INT WFC). The majority of these galaxies are members of the M31 subgroup and the observations are deep enough to study the top few magnitudes of the red giant branch in each system. We previously measured the location of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) for Andromeda I, Andromeda II and M33 to within systematic uncertainties of typically {\textless}0.05 mag. As the TRGB acts as a standard candle in old, metal-poor stellar populations, we were able to derive distances to each of these galaxies. Here we derive TRGB distances to the giant spiral galaxy M31 and 13 additional dwarf galaxies - NGC 205, 185, 147, Pegasus, WLM, LGS3, Cetus, Aquarius, And III, V, VI, VII and the newly discovered dwarf spheroidal And IX. The observations for each of the dwarf galaxies were intentionally taken in photometric conditions. In addition to the distances, we also self-consistently derive the median metallicity of each system from the colour of their red giant branches. This allows us to take into account the small metallicity variation of the absolute I magnitude of the TRGB. The homogeneous nature of our data and the identical analysis applied to each of the 17 Local Group galaxies ensures that these estimates form a reliable set of distance and metallicity determinations that are ideal for comparative studies of Local Group galaxy properties.},

	abstract = {Galactic charged cosmic rays (notably electrons, positrons, antiprotons, and light antinuclei) are powerful probes of dark matter annihilation or decay, in particular, for candidates heavier than a few MeV or tiny evaporating primordial black holes. Recent measurements by PAMELA, AMS-02, or Voyager on positrons and antiprotons already translate into constraints on several models over a large mass range. However, these constraints depend on Galactic transport models, in particular, the diffusive halo size, subject to theoretical and statistical uncertainties. We update the so-called MIN-MED-MAX benchmark transport parameters that yield generic minimal, median, and maximal dark-matter-induced fluxes; this reduces the uncertainties on fluxes by a factor of about 2 for positrons and 6 for antiprotons, with respect to their former version. We also provide handy fitting formulas for the associated predicted secondary antiproton and positron background fluxes. Finally, for more refined analyses, we provide the full details of the model parameters and covariance matrices of uncertainties.},

	abstract = {The detailed distribution and kinematics of the atomic and the CO-bright molecular hydrogen in the disc of the Milky Way inside the solar circle are derived under the assumptions of axisymmetry and pure circular motions. We divide the Galactic disc into a series of rings, and assume that the gas in each ring is described by four parameters: its rotation velocity, velocity dispersion, midplane density and its scale height. We fit these parameters to the Galactic H I and {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}12{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}CO (J = 1-0) data by producing artificial H I and CO line-profiles and comparing them with the observations. Our approach allows us to fit all parameters to the data simultaneously without assuming a-priori a radial profile for one of the parameters. We present the distribution and kinematics of the H I and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in both the approaching (QIV) and the receding (QI) regions of the Galaxy. Our best-fit models reproduces remarkably well the observed H I and CO longitude-velocity diagrams up to a few degrees of distance from the midplane. With the exception of the innermost 2.5 kpc, QI and QIV show very similar kinematics. The rotation curves traced by the H I and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} follow each other closely, flattening beyond R = 6.5 kpc. Both the H I and the H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} surface densities show a) a deep depression at 0.5 \&lt; R \&lt; 2.5 kpc, analogous to that shown by some nearby barred galaxies, b) local overdensities that can be interpreted in terms of spiral arms or ring-like features in the disc. The H I (H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) properties are fairly constant in the region outside the depression, with typical velocity dispersion of 8.9 $\pm$ 1.1 (4.4 $\pm$ 1.2) km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, density of 0.43 $\pm$ 0.11 (0.42 $\pm$ 0.22) cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and HWHM scale height of 202 $\pm$ 28 (64 $\pm$ 12) pc. We also show that the H I opacity in the LAB data can be accounted for by using an "effective" spin temperature of 150 K: assuming an optically thin regime leads to an underestimate of the H I mass by about 30\%.},

	abstract = {We use new Herschel multiband imaging of the Andromeda galaxy to analyse how dust heating occurs in the central regions of galaxy spheroids that are essentially devoid of young stars. We construct a dust temperature map of M31 through fitting modified blackbodies to the Herschel data, and find that the temperature within 2 kpc rises strongly from the mean value in the disc of 17 $\pm$ 1 to ∼35 K at the centre. Ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (IR) imaging of the central few kpc shows directly the absence of young stellar populations, delineates the radial profile of the stellar density and demonstrates that even the near-UV dust extinction is optically thin in M31's bulge. This allows the direct calculation of the stellar radiation heating in the bulge, U*(r), as a function of radius. The increasing temperature profile in the centre matches that expected from the stellar heating, i.e. that the dust heating and cooling rates track each other over nearly two orders of magnitude in U*. The modelled dust heating is in excess of the observed dust temperatures, suggesting that it is more than sufficient to explain the observed IR emission. Together with the wavelength-dependent absorption cross-section of the dust, this demonstrates directly that it is the optical, not UV, radiation that sets the heating rate. This analysis shows that neither young stellar populations nor stellar near-UV radiation is necessary to heat dust to warm temperatures in galaxy spheroids. Rather, it is the high densities of Gyr-old stellar populations that provide a sufficiently strong diffuse radiation field to heat the dust. To the extent which these results pertain to the tenuous dust found in the centres of early-type galaxies remains yet to be explored.},

We introduce here Herschel Space Observatory PACS and SPIRE photometric observations of M31 which cover the far-infrared to sub-mm wavelengths (70-500 μm). These new observations reveal that the total IR luminosity of M31 is relatively weak, with L IR=109.65 L ⊙, only 10\% of the total luminosity of M31. However, as seen in the previous studies of M31, the IR luminosity is dominated by a 10 kpc ring in all Herschel bands. This is distinct from the optical, where the bulge in the central 2kpc, dominates the luminosity, clearly demonstrating how different components at distinct positions in a galaxy contribute to make the integrated SED.},

	abstract = {We use hierarchical Bayesian regression analysis to investigate star formation laws in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) in both local (30, 155 and 750 pc) and global cases. We study and compare the well-known Kennicutt-Schmidt law, the extended Schmidt law and the metallicity/star formation correlation. Using a combination of Hα and 24 μm emission, a combination of far-ultraviolet and 24 μm, and the total infrared emission, we estimate the total star formation rate (SFR) in M31 to be between 0.35 $\pm$ 0.04 and 0.4 $\pm$ 0.04 M⊙ yr-1. We produce a stellar mass surface density map using IRAC 3.6 μm emission and measured the total stellar mass to be 6.9 × 1010 M⊙. For the Kennicutt-Schmidt law in M31, we find the power-law index N to be between 0.49 and 1.18; for all the laws, the power-law index varies more with changing gas tracer than with SFR tracer. The power-law index also changes with distance from the centre of the galaxy. We also applied the commonly used ordinary least-squares fitting method and showed that using different fitting methods leads to different power-law indices. There is a correlation between the surface density of SFR and the stellar mass surface density, which confirms that the Kennicutt-Schmidt law needs to be extended to consider the other physical properties of galaxies. We found a weak correlation between metallicity, the SFR and the stellar mass surface density.},

	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We investigate the relationships between dust and gas, and study the star formation law in M 31. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We have derived distributions of dust temperature and dust opacity across M 31 at 45'' arcsec resolution using the Spitzer data. With the opacity map and a standard dust model we de-reddened the Hα emission yielding the first Hα map of M 31 corrected for extinction. We compared the emissions from dust, Hα, HI, and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} by means of radial distributions, pixel-to-pixel correlations, and wavelet cross-correlations. We calculated the star formation rate and star formation efficiency from the de-reddened Hα emission. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The dust temperature steeply decreases from 30 K near the center to 15 K at large radii. The mean dust optical depth at the Hα wavelength along the line of sight is about 0.7. The radial decrease in the dust-to-gas ratio is similar to that of the oxygen abundance. Extinction is nearly linearly correlated with the total gas surface density within limited radial intervals. On scales \&lt;2 kpc, cold dust emission is best correlated with that of neutral gas, and warm dust emission with that of ionized gas. The Hα emission is slightly better correlated with emission at 70 μm than at 24 μm. The star formation rate in M 31 is low. In the area 6 kpc \&lt; R \&lt; 17 kpc, the total SFR is ≃0.3 \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. A linear relationship exists between surface densities of SFR and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law between SFR and total gas has a power-law index of 1.30 $\pm$ 0.05 in the radial range of R = 7-11 kpc increasing by about 0.3 for R = 11-13 kpc. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The better 70 μm-Hα than 24 μm-Hα correlation plus an excess in the 24 μm/70 μm intensity ratio indicates that other sources than dust grains, e.g. those of stellar origin, contribute to the 24 μm emission. The lack of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in the central region could be related to the lack of HI and the low opacity/high temperature of the dust. Since neither SFR nor SFE is well correlated with the surface density of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} or total gas, other factors than gas density must play an important role in the formation of massive stars in M 31. The molecular depletion time scale of 1.1 Gyr indicates that M 31 is about three times less efficient in forming young massive stars than M 33.},

	abstract = {Recent accurate measurements of cosmic-ray (CR) protons and nuclei by ATIC-2, CREAM, and PAMELA reveal (1) unexpected spectral hardening in the spectra of CR species above a few hundred GeV per nucleon, (2) a harder spectrum of He compared to protons, and (3) softening of the CR spectra just below the break energy. These newly discovered features may offer a clue to the origin of the observed high-energy Galactic CRs. We discuss possible interpretations of these spectral features and make predictions for the secondary CR fluxes and secondary-to-primary ratios, anisotropy of CRs, and diffuse Galactic γ-ray emission in different phenomenological scenarios. Our predictions can be tested by currently running or near-future high-energy astrophysics experiments.},

	abstract = {The propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy is understood as a diffusive process where the magnetic field irregularities serve as scattering center. In this paper we pursue the idea that particles which interact with turbulent magnetic fields should naturally also gain energy due to a stochastic second-order Fermi type of acceleration. This link between diffusion and reacceleration is based on general physical principles, and we can show that the cosmic-ray data can be explained in this 'Diffusive Reacceleration Model.' As a consequence, the escape length lambdaesc(E), which defines the particles path in the galaxy, becomes a power-law in rigidity with an exponent of -1/3, which would indicate a Kolmogorov-type spectrum of magnetic turbulences. The increase of lambdaesc(E) combined with the increase of the amount of reacceleration to low energies in then interpreted as a decrease of the diffusion coefficient or an increase of the frequencies of scattering center.},

	abstract = {An excess γ -ray signal toward the outer halo of M31 has recently been reported. Although other explanations are plausible, the possibility that it arises from dark matter (DM) is valid. In this work we interpret the excess in the framework of DM annihilation, using as our representative case WIMP DM annihilating to bottom quarks, and we perform a detailed study of the systematic uncertainty in the J -factor for the M31 field. We find that the signal favors a DM particle with a mass of ∼45 - 72 GeV . While the mass is well constrained, the systematic uncertainty in the cross section spans 3 orders of magnitude, ranging from ∼5 ×10-27- 5 ×10-24 cm3 s-1 . This high uncertainty is due to two main factors, namely, an uncertainty in the substructure nature and geometry of the DM halos for both M31 and the Milky Way (MW), and correspondingly, an uncertainty in the contribution to the signal from the MW's DM halo along the line of sight. However, under the conditions that the minimum subhalo mass is ≲10-6 M⊙ and the actual contribution from the MW's DM halo along the line of sight is at least ∼30 \% of its total value, we show that there is a large overlap with the DM interpretations of both the Galactic center (GC) excess and the antiproton excess, while also being compatible with the limits for the MW dwarf spheroidals. More generally, we summarize the results from numerous complementary DM searches in the energy range 10 GeV-300 GeV corresponding to the GC excess and identify a region in parameter space that still remains viable for discovery of the DM particle.},

Due to their proximity, high dark matter content, and lack of astrophysical backgrounds, dwarf spheroidal galaxies are widely considered to be among the most promising targets for the indirect detection of dark matter via γ rays. Here we report on γ-ray observations of 25 Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies based on 4 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data. None of the dwarf galaxies are significantly detected in γ rays, and we present γ-ray flux upper limits between 500 MeV and 500 GeV. We determine the dark matter content of 18 dwarf spheroidal galaxies from stellar kinematic data and combine LAT observations of 15 dwarf galaxies to constrain the dark matter annihilation cross section. We set some of the tightest constraints to date on the annihilation of dark matter particles with masses between 2 GeV and 10 TeV into prototypical standard model channels. We find these results to be robust against systematic uncertainties in the LAT instrument performance, diffuse γ-ray background modeling, and assumed dark matter density profile.},

	abstract = {We present a new formalism designed to discover dark matter annihilation occurring in the Milky Way's dwarf galaxies. The statistical framework extracts all available information in the data by simultaneously combining observations of all the dwarf galaxies and incorporating the impact of particle physics properties, the distribution of dark matter in the dwarfs, and the detector response. The method performs maximally powerful frequentist searches and produces confidence limits on particle physics parameters. Probability distributions of test statistics under various hypotheses are constructed exactly, without relying on large sample approximations. The derived limits have proper coverage by construction and claims of detection are not biased by imperfect background modeling. We implement this formalism using data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to search for an annihilation signal in the complete sample of Milky Way dwarfs whose dark matter distributions can be reliably determined. We find that the observed data are consistent with background for each of the dwarf galaxies individually as well as in a joint analysis. The strongest constraints are at small dark matter particle masses. Taking the median of the systematic uncertainty in dwarf density profiles, the cross section upper limits are below the pure s -wave weak scale relic abundance value (2.2 ×1 0-26 cm3 s-1 ) for dark matter masses below 26 GeV (for annihilation into b b ¯), 29 GeV (τ+τ-), 35 GeV (u u ¯,d d ¯,s s ¯,c c ¯, and g g ), 6 GeV (e+e-), and 114 GeV (γ γ ). For dark matter particle masses less than 1 TeV, these represent the strongest limits obtained to date using dwarf galaxies.},

	abstract = {Due to their proximity, high dark-matter (DM) content, and apparent absence of non-thermal processes, Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) are excellent targets for the indirect detection of DM. Recently, eight new dSph candidates were discovered using the first year of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We searched for gamma-ray emission coincident with the positions of these new objects in six years of Fermi Large Area Telescope data. We found no significant excesses of gamma-ray emission. Under the assumption that the DES candidates are dSphs with DM halo properties similar to the known dSphs, we computed individual and combined limits on the velocity-averaged DM annihilation cross section for these new targets. If the estimated DM content of these dSph candidates is confirmed, they will constrain the annihilation cross section to lie below the thermal relic cross section for DM particles with masses ≲ 20 \{GeV\} annihilating via the b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\} or τ+τ- channels.},

Even in this case, however, Reticulum II has the most significant γ -ray signal of any known dwarf galaxy.

	abstract = {We analyze 11 years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) data corresponding to the sky regions of seven dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies. DIrrs are dark matter (DM)-dominated systems, proposed as interesting targets for the indirect search of DM with gamma rays. The galaxies represent interesting cases with a strong disagreement between the density profiles (core versus cusp) inferred from observations and numerical simulations. In this work, we addressed the problem by considering two different DM profiles, based on both the fit to the rotation curve (in this case, a Burkert cored profile) and results from N -body cosmological simulations (i.e., Navarro-Frenk-White cuspy profile). We also include halo substructure in our analysis, which is expected to boost the DM signal by a factor of 10 in halos such as those of dIrrs. For each DM model and dIrr, we create a spatial template of the expected DM-induced gamma-ray signal to be used in the analysis of Fermi-LAT data. No significant emission is detected from any of the targets in our sample. Thus, we compute upper limits on the DM annihilation cross section versus mass parameter space. Among the seven dIrrs, we find IC10 and NGC6822 to yield the most stringent individual constraints, independently of the adopted DM profile. We also produce combined DM limits for all objects in the sample, which turn out to be dominated by IC10 for all DM models and annihilation channels, i.e., b b ¯, τ+τ-, and W+W-. The strongest constraints are obtained for b b ¯ and are at the level of ⟨σ v ⟩∼7 ×10-26 cm3 s-1 at mχ∼6 GeV . Though these limits are a factor of ∼3 higher than the thermal relic cross section at low weakly interacting massive particles masses, they are independent from and complementary to those obtained by means of other targets.},

	abstract = {We analyze the first two years of data from the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope from the direction of the inner 10$\,^{\circ}$ around the Galactic Center with the intention of constraining, or finding evidence of, annihilating dark matter. We find that the morphology and spectrum of the emission between 1.25$\,^{\circ}$ and 10$\,^{\circ}$ from the Galactic Center is well described by the processes of decaying pions produced in cosmic ray collisions with gas, and the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic ray electrons in both the disk and bulge of the Inner Galaxy, along with gamma rays from known points sources in the region. The observed spectrum and morphology of the emission within approximately 1.25$\,^{\circ}$ (∼175 parsecs) of the Galactic Center, in contrast, departs from the expectations for by these processes. Instead, we find an additional component of gamma ray emission that is highly concentrated around the Galactic Center. The observed morphology of this component is consistent with that predicted from annihilating dark matter with a cusped (and possibly adiabatically contracted) halo distribution (ρ∝r-, with γ=1.18 to 1.33). The observed spectrum of this component, which peaks at energies between 1-4 GeV (in E2 units), can be well fit by a 7-10 GeV dark matter particle annihilating primarily to tau leptons with a cross section in the range of {\textless}σv{\textgreater}=4.6×10-27 to 5.3×10-26 cm3/s, depending on how the dark matter distribution is normalized. We also discuss other sources for this emission, including the possibility that much of it originates from the Milky Way's supermassive black hole.},

	abstract = {Decaying or annihilating dark matter particles could be detected through gamma-ray emission from the species they decay or annihilate into. This is usually done by modeling the flux from specific dark matter-rich objects such as the Milky Way halo, Local Group dwarfs, and nearby groups. However, these objects are expected to have significant emission from baryonic processes as well, and the analyses discard gamma-ray data over most of the sky. Here we construct full-sky templates for gamma-ray flux from the large-scale structure within ∼200 Mpc by means of a suite of constrained N -body simulations (CSIBORG) produced using the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies algorithm. Marginalizing over uncertainties in this reconstruction, small-scale structure, and parameters describing astrophysical contributions to the observed gamma-ray sky, we compare to observations from the Fermi Large Area Telescope to constrain dark matter annihilation cross sections and decay rates through a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis. We rule out the thermal relic cross section for s -wave annihilation for all mχ≲7 GeV /c2 at 95\% confidence if the annihilation produces gluons or quarks less massive than the bottom quark. We infer a contribution to the gamma-ray sky with the same spatial distribution as dark matter decay at 3.3 σ . Although this could be due to dark matter decay via these channels with a decay rate Γ ≈6 ×10-28 s−1 , we find that a power-law spectrum of index p =-2.75-0.46+0.71 , likely of baryonic origin, is preferred by the data.},

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of propagation of cosmic ray electrons (CRE) on the non-thermal (NTH; synchrotron)-far-infrared correlations in M 31 and M 33. The thermal (TH) and NTH emission components of the radio continuum emission at 1.4 GHz and one higher frequency are compared with dust emission from M 31 and M 33 using Spitzer data. In both galaxies the TH emission is linearly correlated with the emission from warm dust (24 μ m, 70 μ m), but the power laws of the NTH-FIR correlations have exponents b {\textless} 1 that increase with increasing frequency. Furthermore, the values of b for M 33 are significantly smaller (b ≃ 0.4) than those for M 31 (b ≃ 0.6). We interpret the differences in b as differences in the diffusion length of the CRE. We estimate the diffusion length in two ways: (1) by smoothing the NTH emission at the higher frequency until the correlation with NTH emission at 1.4 GHz has b = 1, and (2) by smoothing the TH emission until the correlation with the NTH emission at the same frequency has b = 1, assuming that the TH emission represents the source distribution of the CRE. Our smoothing experiments show that M 31 only has a thin NTH disc with a scale height of h = 0.3-0.4 kpc at 1.4 GHz, whereas M 33 has a similar thin disc as well as a thick disc with scale height hthick ≃ 2 kpc. In the thin discs, the (deprojected) diffusion length at 1.4 GHz is ≃1.5 kpc, yielding a diffusion coefficient of ≃2 × 1028 cm2 s-1. The structure, strength and regularity of the magnetic field in a galaxy as well as the existence of a thick disc determine the diffusion of the CRE, and hence, the power-law exponent of the NTH-FIR correlations.},

	abstract = {We reproduce the rotation curve of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) by taking into account its bulge, disk, and halo components, considering the last one to contain the major part of dark matter mass. Hence, our prescription is to split the galactic bulge into two components, namely, the inner and main bulges, respectively. Both bulges are thus modeled by exponential density profiles since we underline that the widely accepted de Vaucouleurs law fails to reproduce the whole galactic bulge rotation curve. In addition, we adopt various well-known phenomenological dark matter profiles to estimate the dark matter mass in the halo region. Moreover, we apply the least-squares fitting method to determine from the rotation curve the model free parameters, namely, the characteristic (central) density, scale radius, and consequently the total mass. To do so, we perform Markov chain Monte Carlo statistical analyses based on the Metropolis algorithm, maximizing our likelihoods adopting velocity and radii data points of the rotation curves. We do not fit separately the components for bulges, disk and halo, but we perform an overall fit including all the components and employing all the data points. Thus, we critically analyze our corresponding findings and, in particular, we employ the Bayesian Information Criterion to assess the most accredited model to describe M31 dark matter dynamics.},

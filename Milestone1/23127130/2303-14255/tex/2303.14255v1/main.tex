\shortauthortitle{Mullen \MakeLowercase{\textit{et al.}}: Virtual Agent Interaction}

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{We present PACE, a novel method for modifying motion-captured virtual agents to interact with and move throughout dense, cluttered 3D scenes. Our approach changes a given motion sequence of a virtual agent as needed to adjust to the obstacles and objects in the environment. We first take the individual frames of the motion sequence most important for modeling interactions with the scene and pair them with the relevant scene geometry, obstacles, and semantics such that interactions in the agents motion match the affordances of the scene (e.g., standing on a floor or sitting in a chair). We then optimize the motion of the human by directly altering the high-DOF pose at each frame in the motion to better account for the unique geometric constraints of the scene. Our formulation uses novel loss functions that maintain a realistic flow and natural-looking motion. We compare our method with prior motion generating techniques and highlight the benefits of our method with a perceptual study and physical plausibility metrics. Human raters preferred our method over the prior approaches. Specifically, they preferred our method 57.1\% of the time versus the state-of-the-art method using existing motions, and 81.0\% of the time versus a state-of-the-art motion synthesis method. Additionally, our method performs significantly higher on established physical plausibility and interaction metrics. Specifically, we outperform competing methods by over 1.2\% in terms of the non-collision metric and by over 18\% in terms of the contact metric. We have integrated our interactive system with Microsoft HoloLens and demonstrate its benefits in real-world indoor scenes. Our project website is available at \url{https://gamma.umd.edu/pace/}

  \caption{We present an approach to create moving virtual agents that interact with a dense or cluttered 3D scene, either virtual or real, based in motion-captured human data. We have integrated our system with Microsoft HoloLens and highlight its benefit in terms of moving virtual agents in real-world scenes. As key functionality of our method, we adjust or tailor the motion-captured agents motion to the obstacles in the scene like the chairs and tables in the scene above. Our optimization-based approach improves the performance in terms of well-known interaction metrics corresponding to non-collision and contact. In this figure, which we captured using our Microsoft HoloLens, we observe a virtual agent navigating around the obstacles in the environment.}

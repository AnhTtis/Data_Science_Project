    "abstract": "The out-of-equilibrium many-body quantum dynamics of an interacting Bose gas trapped in a one-dimensional composite double-well potential is studied by solving the many-body Schrödinger equation numerically accurately by employing the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB) method. The composite double-well is formed by merging two deformed harmonic wells having a hump at their centre. We characterised the dynamics by the time evolution of survival probability, fragmentation, and many-particle position and momentum variances. Our study demonstrates the prominent role played by the higher orbitals in the dynamics and thereby highlighted the necessity of a many-body technique like MCTDHB which can take into account all the relevant orbitals for the accurate description of complex many-body dynamics. Further, we showed that the universality of fragmentation with respect to the number of particles corresponding to a particular interaction strength is also exhibited by the higher-order orbitals. Therefore, it is a robust phenomenon not limited to systems that can be described by two orbitals only.",

abstract = {There is a pressing need for robust and straightforward methods to create potentials for trapping Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) that are simultaneously dynamic, fully arbitrary and sufficiently stable to not heat the ultracold gas. We show here how to accomplish these goals, using a rapidly moving laser beam that ‘paints’ a time-averaged optical dipole potential in which we create BECs in a variety of geometries, including toroids, ring lattices and square lattices. Matter wave interference patterns confirm that the trapped gas is a condensate. As a simple illustration of dynamics, we show that the technique can transform a toroidal condensate into a ring lattice and back into a toroid. The technique is general and should work with any sufficiently polarizable low-energy particles}

	Abstract = {The creation of a photon-atom bound state was first envisaged for the case of an atom in a long-lived excited state inside a high-quality microwave cavity. In practice, however, light forces in the microwave domain are insufficient to support an atom against gravity. Although optical photons can provide forces of the required magnitude, atomic decay rates and cavity losses are larger too, and so the atom-cavity system must be continually excited by an external laser. Such an approach also permits continuous observation of the atom's position, by monitoring the light transmitted through the cavity. The dual role of photons in this system distinguishes it from other single-atom experiments such as those using magneto-optical traps, ion traps or a far-off-resonance optical trap. Here we report high-finesse optical cavity experiments in which the change in transmission induced by a single slow atom approaching the cavity triggers an external feedback switch which traps the atom in a light field containing about one photon on average. The oscillatory motion of the trapped atom induces oscillations in the transmitted light intensity; we attribute periodic structure in intensity-correlation-function data to 'long-distance' flights of the atom between different anti-nodes of the standing-wave in the cavity. The system should facilitate investigations of the dynamics of single quantum objects and may find future applications in quantum information processing.},

abstract = {The out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics of a bosonic Josephson junction (BJJ) with long-range interaction is studied in real space by solving the time-dependent many-body Schrödinger equation numerically accurately using the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons. Having the many-boson wave-function at hand we can examine the impact of the range of the interaction on the properties of the BJJ dynamics, viz. density oscillations and their collapse, self trapping, depletion and fragmentation, as well as the position variance, both at the mean-field and many-body level. Explicitly, the frequency of the density oscillations and the time required for their collapse, the value of fragmentation at the plateau, the maximal and the minimal values of the position variance in each cycle of oscillation and the overall pace of its growth are key to our study. We find competitive effect between the interaction and the confining trap. The presence of the tail part of the interaction basically enhances the effective repulsion as the range of the interaction is increased starting from a short, finite range. But, as the range becomes comparable with the trap size, the system approaches a situation where all the atoms feel a constant potential and the impact of the tail on the dynamics diminishes. There is an optimal range of the interaction in which physical quantities of the junction are attaining their extreme values.}

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We unravel the correlated tunneling dynamics of an impurity trapped in a double well and interacting repulsively with a majority species of lattice trapped bosons. Upon quenching the tilt of the double well it is found that the quench-induced tunneling dynamics depends crucially on the interspecies interaction strength and the presence of entanglement inherent in the system. In particular, for weak couplings the impurity performs a rather irregular tunneling process in the double well. Increasing the interspecies coupling it is possible to control the response of the impurity which undergoes a delayed tunneling while the majority species effectively acts as a material barrier. For very strong interspecies interaction strengths the impurity exhibits a self-trapping behavior. We showcase that a similar tunneling dynamics takes place for two weakly interacting impurities and identify its underlying transport mechanisms in terms of pair and single-particle tunneling processes.}

We used the interference of atoms released from the traps as a sensitive probe of these statistics. By controlling relative strengths of the tunneling rate between traps and atom-atom interactions within each trap, we observed trap states characterized by sub-Poissonian number fluctuations and adiabatic transitions between these number-squeezed states and coherent states of the atom field. The quantum states produced in this work may enable substantial gains in sensitivity for atom interference–based instruments as well as fundamental studies of quantum phase transitions.}}

    abstract = { Atomtronics deals with matter-wave circuits of ultracold atoms manipulated through magnetic or laser-generated guides with different shapes and intensities. In this way, new types of quantum networks can be constructed in which coherent fluids are controlled with the know-how developed in the atomic and molecular physics community. In particular, quantum devices with enhanced precision, control, and flexibility of their operating conditions can be accessed. Concomitantly, new quantum simulators and emulators harnessing on the coherent current flows can also be developed. Here, the authors survey the landscape of atomtronics-enabled quantum technology and draw a roadmap for the field in the near future. The authors review some of the latest progress achieved in matter-wave circuits' design and atom-chips. Atomtronic networks are deployed as promising platforms for probing many-body physics with a new angle and a new twist. The latter can be done at the level of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations. Numerous relevant problems in mesoscopic physics, such as persistent currents and quantum transport in circuits of fermionic or bosonic atoms, are studied through a new lens. The authors summarize some of the atomtronics quantum devices and sensors. Finally, the authors discuss alkali-earth and Rydberg atoms as potential platforms for the realization of atomtronic circuits with special features. },

title = {Transport dynamics of ultracold atoms in a triple-well transistor-like potential},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The transport of atoms is experimentally studied in a transistor-like triple-well potential consisting of a narrow gate well surrounded by source and drain wells. Atoms are initially loaded into the source well with pre-determined temperature and chemical potential. Energetic atoms flow from the source, across the gate, and into the drain where they are removed using a resonant light beam. The manifestation of atom–atom interactions and dissipation is evidenced by a rapid population growth in the initially vacant gate well. The transport dynamics are shown to depend strongly on a feedback parameter determined by the relative heights of the two barriers forming the gate region. For a range of feedback parameter values, experiments establish that the gate atoms develop a larger chemical potential and lower temperature than those in the source.}

The model used is fashioned as a minimal bipartite system consisting of a trimer coupled weakly to a monomer. Semiclassical insights into the fragmentation dynamics of the condensate is obtained by mapping out the Arnold web of the high dimensional classical phase space. A remarkable one-to-one correspondence between the quantum state space in occupation number representation and the classical Arnold web in action space is observed. The relevance of dynamical tunneling for the dynamics of Fock states near resonance junctions on the Arnold web is highlighted. We also predict the possibility of manipulating the transport within the trimer subsystem due to the weak coupling to the monomer.}

abstract = {Two superconductors connected by a bridge made out of nonsuperconducting material form a so-called Josephson junction (see the Perspective by Belzig). Valtolina et al. replaced the superconductors with two reservoirs of a superfluid Fermi gas and connected them by a weak link to allow atoms to move from one side to the other. Then they made one reservoir more populated than the other and studied the ensuing dynamics as a function of interaction strength between the atoms. In a related experiment, Husmann et al. kept the interaction strength at its maximum, but varied the temperature and the properties of the link. As temperature increased, the superfluid disappeared and thermal transport took over. Science, this issue p. 1498, p. 1505; see also p. 1470 The effects of interaction strength are studied in a junction composed of two 6Li superfluids. [Also see Perspective by Belzig] The Josephson effect is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon that reveals the broken symmetry associated with any superfluid state. Here we report on the observation of the Josephson effect between two fermionic superfluids coupled through a thin tunneling barrier. We show that the relative population and phase are canonically conjugate dynamical variables throughout the crossover from the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid regime. For larger initial excitations from equilibrium, the dynamics of the superfluids become dissipative, which we ascribe to the propagation of vortices through the superfluid bulk. Our results highlight the robust nature of resonant superfluids.}}

The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 × 1012 per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.}}

    abstract = "{Quantum computers, although not yet available on the market, will revolutionise the future of information processing. Already now, quantum computers of special purpose, i.e., quantum simulators, are within reach. The physics of ultracold atoms, ions, and molecules offers unprecedented possibilities of control of quantum many systems, and novel possibilities of applications for quantum information and quantum metrology. Particularly fascinating is the possibility of using ultracold atoms in lattices to simulate condensed matter or even high energy physics. This book provides a comprehensive overview of ultracold lattice gases as quantum simulators, an interdisciplinary field involving atomic, molecular, and optical physics; quantum optics; quantum information; and condensed matter and high energy physics. It includes some introductory chapters on basic concepts and methods, and focuses on the physics of spinor, dipolar, disordered, and frustrated lattice gases, before reviewing in detail artificial lattice gauge fields with ultracold gases. The last part of the book moves onto a discussion of possible implementations universal quantum computers with ultracold atoms. After a crash course in quantum information theory, several models of quantum computation with ultracold gases are presented, as well as the current understanding of condensed matter from a quantum information perspective. The book ends with the general discussion of various detection methods that are unique for ultracold atoms.}",

Tunneling is suppressed by a small potential difference between wells, or tilt. However, tunneling resonances occur for critical values of the tilt when the barrier is high. At resonance, tunneling times on the order of 10–100 ms are possible. Furthermore, such tilted resonances lead to a dynamical scheme for creating few-body NOON-like macroscopic superposition states which are protected by the many-body wave function against potential fluctuations.}

Unlike in the typically used two-mode model based on the lowest single-particle eigenstates of the external potential, the improved model uses a basis of properly chosen effective wave functions originating in the many-body model. Accuracy of the improved model is examined and it is shown that within a certain limit of inter-particle interaction strength, the model recovers an exact evolution of the wells' populations much more closely than the traditional two-mode model.}

We investigate the dynamics of the two-site BHM from the purely quantum viewpoint by recasting first the model within a spin picture and using then the related dynamical algebra. The latter allows us to study thoroughly the energy spectrum structure and to interpret quantally the classical symmetries of the two-site dynamics. The energy spectrum is also evaluated through various approximations relying on the coherent state approach. }

In particular, the difference in the occupation between the two sites, where initially all particles are at one site, was calculated analytically. This quantity exhibits collapses and revivals that superimpose rapid oscillations. Excellent agreement with the exact numerical solution was found. The semiclassical approximation where  plays the role of Planck's constant was used and perturbation theory to order  was applied. The occupation difference was calculated also for the case where initially both sites are occupied provided that the difference in occupation is sufficiently large. This work provides an analytical description of results that were so far found only numerically. Similar behavior and analysis are expected for a large variety of physical situations.}

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics of an interacting Bose gas trapped in a one-dimensional asymmetric double-well potential is studied by solving the many-body Schrödinger equation numerically accurately. We examine how the gradual loss of symmetry of the confining trap affects the macroscopic quantum tunneling dynamics of the system between the two wells. In an asymmetric double well, the two wells are not equivalent anymore, say, the left well is deeper than the right one. Accordingly, we analyze the dynamics by initially preparing the condensate in both the left and the right wells. The dynamics of the system is characterized by the time evolution of a few physical quantities of increasing many-body complexity, namely, the survival probability, depletion and fragmentation, and the many-particle position and momentum variances. In particular, we have examined the frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillations of the survival probabilities, the time scale for the development of fragmentation and its degree, and the growth and oscillatory behavior of the many-particle position and momentum variances. There is an overall suppression of the oscillations of the survival probabilities in an asymmetric double well, except for resonant values of asymmetry for which the one-body ground state energy in the right well matches with one of the one-body excited states in the left well, thereby resulting in resonantly enhanced tunneling from the right well ground state. Overall, depending on whether the condensate is initially prepared in the left or right well, the repulsive inter-atomic interactions affect the survival probabilities differently. For a sufficiently strong repulsive interaction, the system is found to become fragmented. The degree of fragmentation depends both on the asymmetry of the trap and the initial well in which the condensate is prepared in a non-trivial manner. Furthermore, we show that the phenomenon of resonantly enhanced tunneling can be accompanied by a large degree of fragmentation (depletion) for the strong (weak) interaction. The many-particle position and momentum variances follow the density oscillations of the system in the asymmetric double well and bears prominent signatures of the degree of depletion or fragmentation, depending on the strength of the interactions. These quantities further exhibit a fine structure signifying a breathing-mode oscillation. Finally, a universality of fragmentation for systems made of different numbers of particles but the same interaction parameter is also found and its dependence on the asymmetry is investigated. The phenomenon is robust despite the asymmetry of the junction and admits a macroscopically-large fragmented condensate characterized by a diverging many-particle position variance. This is as far as one can get from the dynamics of the density in the junction.}

abstract = {We analyze the emergence of Shapiro resonances in tunnel-coupled Bose–Einstein condensates, realizing a bosonic Josephson junction. Our analysis is based on an experimentally relevant implementation using magnetic double-well potentials on an atomchip. In this configuration, the potential bias (implementing the junction voltage) and the potential barrier (realizing the Josephson link) are intrinsically coupled. We show that the dynamically driven system exhibits significantly enhanced Shapiro resonances which will facilitate experimental observation. To describe the system's response to the dynamic drive, we compare a single-mode Gross–Pitaevskii (GP) description, an improved two-mode (TM) model and the self-consistent multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree equations for bosons (MCTDHB) method. We show that in the case of significant atom–atom interactions, the spatial dynamics of the involved modes has to be taken into account and only the MCTDHB method allows reliable predictions.}

abstract = {We explore the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional trapped ultracold ensemble of bosonic atoms triggered by the sudden creation of a single ion. The numerical simulations are performed by means of the ab initio multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method for bosons which takes into account all correlations. The dynamics is analyzed via a cluster expansion approach, adapted to bosonic systems of fixed particle number, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the occurring many-body processes. After a transient during which the atomic ensemble separates into fractions which are unbound and bound with respect to the ion, we observe an oscillation in the atomic density which we attribute to the additional length and energy scale induced by the attractive long-range atom–ion interaction. This oscillation is shown to be the main source of spatial coherence and population transfer between the bound and the unbound atomic fraction. Moreover, the dynamics exhibits collapse and revival behavior caused by the dynamical build-up of two-particle correlations demonstrating that a beyond mean-field description is indispensable.}

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We develop an ab initio time-dependent wavefunction based theory for the description of a many-body system of cold interacting bosons. Like the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB), the theory is based on a configurational interaction Ansatz for the many-body wavefunction with time-dependent self-consistent-field orbitals. The theory generalizes the MCTDHB method by incorporating restrictions on the active space of the orbital excitations. The restrictions are specified based on the physical situation at hand. The equations of motion of this time-dependent restricted-active-space self-consistent-field (TD-RASSCF) theory are derived. The similarity between the formal development of the theory for bosons and fermions is discussed. The restrictions on the active space allow the theory to be evaluated under conditions where other wavefunction based methods due to exponential scaling in the numerical effort cannot, and to clearly identify the excitations that are important for an accurate description, significantly beyond the mean-field approach. For ground state calculations we find it to be important to allow a few particles to have the freedom to move in many orbitals, an insight facilitated by the flexibility of the restricted-active-space Ansatz. Moreover, we find that a high accuracy can be obtained by including only even excitations in the many-body self-consistent-field wavefunction. Time-dependent simulations of harmonically trapped bosons subject to a quenching of their noncontact interaction, show failure of the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii approach within a fraction of a harmonic oscillation period. The TD-RASSCF theory remains accurate at much reduced computational cost compared to the MCTDHB method. Exploring the effect of changes of the restricted-active-space allows us to identify that even self-consistent-field excitations are mainly responsible for the accuracy of the method.}

We calculate the ground state of the laser-pumped system and find different stages of self-organization depending on the power of the laser. The modified potential and the laser-mediated coupling between the atomic components give rise to rich many-body physics: an increase of the pump power triggers a self-organization of the atoms while an even larger pump power causes correlations between the self-organized atoms—the BEC becomes fragmented and the reduced density matrix acquires multiple macroscopic eigenvalues. In this fragmented superradiant state, the atoms can no longer be described as two-level systems and the mapping of the system to the Dicke model breaks down.}

title = {Correlations of strongly interacting one-dimensional ultracold dipolar few-boson systems in optical lattices},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Strongly interacting finite ensembles of dipolar bosons in commensurately filled one-dimensional optical lattices exhibit diverse quantum phases that are rich in physics. As the strength of the long-range boson–boson interaction increases, the system transitions across different phases: from a superfluid, through a Mott-insulator and a Tonks–Girardeau gas to a crystal state. The signature of these phases and their transitions can be unequivocally identified by an experimentally detectable order parameter, recently described in Phys. Rev. A 98 235301 (2018 [33]). Herein, we calculate the momentum distributions and the normalized Glauber correlation functions of dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice in order to characterize all their phases. To understand the behavior of the correlations across the phase transitions, we first investigate the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the one-body reduced density matrix as a function of the dipolar interaction strength. We then analyze the real- and momentum-space Glauber correlation functions, thereby gaining a spatially and momentum-resolved insight into the coherence properties of these quantum phases. We find an intriguing structure of non-local correlations that, independently of other observables, reveal the phase transitions of the system. In particular, spatial localization and momentum delocalization accompany the formation of correlated islands in the density as interactions become stronger. Our study showcases that precise control of intersite correlations is possible through the manipulation of the depth of the lattice, while intrasite correlations can be influenced by changing the dipolar interaction strength.}

abstract = {We study the complex quantum dynamics of a system of many interacting atoms in an elongated anharmonic trap. The system is initially in a Bose–Einstein condensed state, well described by Thomas–Fermi profile in the elongated direction and the ground state in the transverse directions. After a sudden quench to a coherent superposition of the ground and lowest energy transverse modes, quantum dynamics starts. We describe this process employing a three-mode many-body model. The experimental realization of this system displays decaying oscillations of the atomic density distribution. While a mean-field description predicts perpetual oscillations of the atomic density distribution, our quantum many-body model exhibits a decay of the oscillations for sufficiently strong atomic interactions. We associate this decay with the fragmentation of the condensate during the evolution. The decay and fragmentation are also linked with the approach of the many-body model to the chaotic regime. The approach to chaos lifts degeneracies and increases the complexity of the eigenstates, enabling the relaxation to equilibrium and the onset of thermalization. We verify that the damping time and quantum signatures of chaos show similar dependences on the interaction strength and on the number of atoms.}

We define phase fluctuations from the full single-particle density matrix by the spatial decay exponent of off-diagonal long-range order. In a regime of mesoscopic particle numbers and moderate contact couplings, we derive the spatial dependence of the amplitude of phase fluctuations, determined from the self-consistently derived shape of the field operator orbitals and Fock space orbital occupation amplitudes. It is shown that the phase fluctuations display a peak, which in turn corresponds to a dip of the first-order correlations in position space, akin to what has previously been obtained in the Tonks–Girardeau limit of very large interactions and low densities.}

We exemplify this effect for both the ground state and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of structureless bosons interacting by a long-range inter-particle interaction and trapped in a two-dimensional single-well potential. We demonstrate that even when the density of the BEC is, say, wider along the y direction and narrower along the x direction, its position variance can actually be smaller and momentum variance larger in the y direction than in the x direction. This behavior of the variance in a many-particle system is counterintuitive. It suggests using the variance as a tool to characterize the strength of correlations along the y and x directions in a trapped BEC.}

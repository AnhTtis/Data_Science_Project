    "abstract": "PKS 2004-447 is a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) harbouring a relativistic jet with gamma-ray emission. On 2019-10-25, the Fermi-Large Area Telescope captured a $γ$-ray flare from this source, offering a chance to study the broad-line region (BLR) and jet during such violent events. This can provide insights to the BLR structure and jet interactions, which are important for active galactic nuclei and host galaxy coevolution. We report X-Shooter observations of enhancements in the broad line components of Balmer, Paschen and He I lines seen only during the post-flare and vanishing 1.5 years after. These features are biased redward up to $\\sim$250 km s$^{-1}$ and are narrower than the pre-existing broad line profiles. This indicates a connection between the relativistic jet and the BLR of a young AGN, and how $γ$-ray production can lead to localised addition of broad emission lines.",

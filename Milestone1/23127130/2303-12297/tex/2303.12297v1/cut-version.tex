\vspace{5pt}
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have the potential to unlock novel photonic and chemical technologies if their optoelectronic properties can be understood and controlled. Yet, recent work has offered contradictory explanations for how TMD absorption spectra change with carrier concentration, fluence, and time. Here, we test our hypothesis that the large broadening and shifting of the strong band-edge features observed in optical spectra arise from the formation of negative trions. We do this by fitting an \textit{ab initio}-based, many-body model to our experimental electrochemical data. Our approach provides an excellent, global description of the potential-dependent linear absorption data. We further leverage our model to demonstrate that trion formation explains the non-monotonic potential dependence of the transient absorption spectra, including through photoinduced derivative line shapes for the trion peak. Our results motivate the continued development of theoretical methods to describe cutting-edge experiments in a physically transparent way.

\maketitle

Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) are promising lightweight and flexible electrode materials for solid-state and electrochemical devices. For light-driven applications such as photovoltaics and photodetectors, optimizing device efficiency requires a fundamental understanding of optoelectronic properties.

Optical spectroscopies of TMDs reveal exotic phenomena, including significant band gap renormalization (BGR) and screening of their quasiparticle binding energies (BES). These two effects determine the energy of the band-edge exciton and tunes its shift as a function of material parameters, such as: TMD composition, substrate, superstrate (often liquid electrolyte in an electrochemical cell), and doping density (here, the presence of electrons in the conduction band).\cite{Berkelbach2018b} For example, the \textit{ab initio} GW~value for the electronic band gap of unsupported ML-\ce{MoS2} is 2.8~eV,\cite{Qiu2013,Ryou2016,Ataei2021,Austin2022}$^,$\footnote{More converged calculations reduce the GW~value to 2.64~eV.\cite{Qiu2015}} whereas its measured band gap is 2.17~eV on graphite\cite{Zhang2014a} and 1.39~eV on gold\cite{Miwa2015}. Crucially, the screening responsible for BGR concomitantly weakens the attraction between electrons and holes in the band-edge excitons. This BES is a countervailing effect which opposes the BGR shift in the optical signal. Hence, only small changes in the optical gap are experimentally observed.\cite{Ugeda2014,Gies2021,Austin2022}

TMDs also exhibit other many-body effects that pose a challenge to their first principles exploration and obfuscate the interpretation of optical measurements. In particular, exciton-electron quasiparticles (negative trions) have been observed in \ce{WS2},\cite{Liu2016b, Zhao2020c, Zipfel2020a, Lan2020, Muir2022}, \ce{WSe2},\cite{Courtade2017,Li2018c,Wagner2020,Lan2020,Yang2022a} \ce{MoSe2},\cite{Li2021c} and \ce{MoS2}\cite{Mak2012, Liu2016b, Kim2019, Huang2022}. Fundamentally, the extent to which trion formation affects the behavior of working devices at room temperature remains unclear.\cite{Lui2014, Goldstein2020a} This is of widespread concern because TMDs are incidentally doped by defects which form during synthesis\cite{Zafar2017,xyzValence2019}, and can also acquire charge from electrolyte solutions\cite{Lin2014}: the resulting conduction band electrons induce trions to form, which causes oscillator strength to transfer from the exciton to the trion signal in optical experiments.\cite{Chernikov2015} A model of minimal complexity that can predict how variations in the microscopic parameters translate to changes in measured quantities, such as spectral features, is therefore essential to disentangle the role of trions and achieve predictive power.

These challenges of interpretation have become prominent in recent years, as experiments have revealed that ML-TMDs display large, complex spectral shifts in device architectures such as photoelectrochemical cells,\cite{Carroll2019} field effect transistors,\cite{Chen2019e, Pradeepa2020} and photovoltaics\cite{Chen2019f}. For example, Sie \textit{et al}.~invoked photoexcitation-induced changes in BGR and BES to explain the spectral shifts observed when pumping ML-\ce{WS2} with increasingly higher laser fluence.\cite{Sie2017} However, since the observations were inconsistent with this explanation, the authors posited a more sophisticated model based on exciton-exciton interactions. More recently, we have reported hot-carrier extraction from a ML-$\rm{MoS}_2$ photoelectrode in a working photoelectrochemical cell which displayed complex changes in the spectral features as a function of applied potential.\cite{Austin2022} As increasingly negative potentials raise the conduction band population, the applied potential affects the magnitudes of BGR and BES. Indeed, we observed a large potential dependence of the position, height, and width of the band-edge ``A-exciton'' peak, analogous to Ref.~\onlinecite{Sie2017}. The potential-dependence at a given time, or `static shift', is evident in the experimental transient absorption (TA)~spectra at 1~ps displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:initial_spectra}. As the photocarriers relax back to their ground state, the peaks' heights and positions undergo both red and blue `dynamic shift' in time (Fig.~\ref{fig:initial_spectra}(right)). These observations are significant because the mechanism of charge transfer and the role of excitons in these devices are not yet fully understood.\cite{Hong2014,Zimmermann2021,Kim2019,Johansson2020,Xu2021} The difficulty of interpreting these shifts illustrates the need for utilizable and transparent frameworks that facilitate interpretation of experimental data. 

Here, we provide a unifying framework based on the doping-dependent emergence of trions to explain the complex behavior of both potential-\cite{Austin2022} and fluence-dependent\cite{Sie2017, Bera2021} spectra. Since in our experiment both the laser pulse and the applied potential affect BGR and BES, the observation of a qualitatively equivalent behavior\footnote{This study further demonstrated a similar time-dependent shift of the band-edge exciton position over the period of electronic relaxation (see Fig.~4 in Ref.~\onlinecite{Sie2017}).} in a different TMD under entirely different experimental conditions suggests the behavior is a signature of the same underlying photophysical process. Indeed, another recent experiment focusing on $\rm{MoS}_2$ further established the universality of this shift in TMDs.\cite{Bera2021} In our analysis, we make two key observations. First, careful inspection of both sets of spectra suggest that they are not always well described by a single peak. Second, recent advances in GW that include free carrier screening predict that the \ce{WS2} A-exciton should neither redshift nor blueshift with increasing carrier density, and---more strikingly---that the absorption spectrum of $\rm{MoS}_2$ should undergo a pronounced and monotonic blueshift with increasing carrier density.\cite{Ataei2021} Both sets of spectra disagree with the cutting-edge theoretical prediction considering only BGR and BES. We resolve this discrepancy by demonstrating that the source of both static and dynamical peak shifts is the formation of the trion, which is the next-most significant many-body effect in these systems.

While a number of descriptions of the trion are available\cite{Chang2018, Chang2019a, Torche2019, Zhumagulov2020, Rana2021, Glazov2020b, Katsch2022}, we adopt the Mahan-Nozi{\'e}res-De Dominicis (MND) Hamiltonian\cite{Mahan2000}---a minimal many-body model of a Fermi polaron consisting of a heavy exciton dressed by a free electron bath---which prioritizes the description of doping-dependent phenomena.\cite{Chang2019a} This approach describes how changing the conduction band occupation causes the trion and exciton peaks to shift in energy, change line shape, and transfer oscillator strength between one another, as presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:steadystate}(a). We also note that, like Ref.~\onlinecite{Ataei2021}, it predicts the A-exciton peak to blueshift with increasing doping.

In the following, we interrogate the ability of this framework to capture the features that arise both in our experimental setup\cite{Austin2022} and in the fluence-dependent studies of Refs.~\onlinecite{Sie2017, Bera2021}. As this theory is designed to describe linear spectra, we first ratify its use by capturing the potential-dependent linear absorption spectra shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:steadystate}(c). At this \ce{ITO_{(s)}|MoS2_{(ML)}|I- / I3^-_{(aq)}} interface the band-edge peak moves to higher energy with more positive applied potential. We claim that the two peaks predicted by the MND theory should be convolved with a Gaussian representing the combined effect of broadening mechanisms and the instrument response to obtain the observed ``superpeak''. That is, when the doping increases: the trion redshifts, the exciton blueshifts, both peaks flatten slightly,\cite{Carbone2020b} and the oscillator strength transfers to the trion peak, as sketched in Fig.~\ref{fig:steadystate}(b). Then, the phenomenological broadening of this total signal will reproduce the shift and change in line shape observed in the experiments.

The TA spectra are shown as full lines, and the MND prediction is dash-dotted. Each TA curve has had its linear background removed, been cropped at the positions of the photoinduced maxima either side of the bleach signal and baselined (see Appendix~\ref{app:preprocess}). Note: as the model is now parameterized to TA~data, the doping values 0–-30~meV no longer correspond precisely to the original values of Ref.~\onlinecite{Chang2019a}, and should be considered as some arbitrary, internal units.}
\vspace{-4pt}
\end{figure}

Use of the MND description requires fitting to the experimental data because we are currently unable to predict certain quantities from \textit{ab initio} calculations. For example, Ref.~\onlinecite{Chang2019a} assumed that the $\rm{MoS}_2$~ML is a defect-free, intrinsic semiconductor at 0~K and unsupported \textit{in vacuo}. In our experimental cell, the balance of BGR and BES can be expected to differ. We will work with the theory not by optimizing for these Hamiltonian parameters by repeatedly solving a many-body equation, but rather by modelling it at the level of its outputs: peak positions, heights, and widths as functions of doping. This is convenient because these functions are predicted to have a simple (near)-linear form,\cite{Chang2019a} such that the gradients and intercepts of these functions become the only free parameters. While this fitting offers no guarantee that a given set of functions all correspond to the same (or any) Hamiltonian, it serves as an accessible starting point for interpreting multifaceted experimental data sets. We describe our protocol for how to extract the model parameters from the potential-dependent photoelectrochemical spectra, which matches the spectra with a manifold of spectral curves as a function of applied potential (e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:steadystate}(d)), in Appendix~\ref{app:optimization-procedure}.  

Figure~\ref{fig:steadystate}(e) shows the result for our linear absorption spectra, which demonstrates the model provides an excellent global fit to the data. As Figs.~\ref{fig:steadystate}(a)~and~(e) illustrate, the static shift of the superpeak with applied potential is mostly due to the transfer of oscillator strength between exciton and trion, with a smaller contribution from the shifting of the underlying peaks. As the potential becomes more positive, the superpeak shifts from the trion position to the exciton position. 

Can this simple explanation for the static shift shed light on the source of the more complex dynamical shift presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:initial_spectra}? After all, TA~is a difference-method where the signal arises from the interplay of the pump and probe pulses, with $\Delta A(\tau) = A(\tau) - A_\mathrm{SS}$, where $A(\tau)$ is the absorption of the excited material, $\tau$ units after the pump, and $A_\mathrm{SS}$ is the unpumped steady-state spectrum. 

To simplify the analysis, we discard the TA~data before $1$~ps, where there is a qualitatively different regime which has been assigned to relaxed free carriers at the band-edge waiting to form excitons.\cite{Ceballos2016, Cunningham2017} However, regardless of the time chosen, we must baseline correct the TA~spectra to isolate the peaks for modelling (see Appendix~\ref{app:preprocess}). This introduces a complication since the initial pump pulse, which generates carriers in both the valence and conduction bands, alters the BGR and BES contributions seen by the probe pulse. The resulting shift of the TA~peaks due to this renormalization results in photoinduced absorption features that appear either side of the main bleach signal,\cite{Pogna2016,Carroll2019,Kastl2022} which is a general effect that arises in the TA~of semiconductors.\cite{Price2015} For us, the trion and exciton peaks contaminate each other in a non-trivial, doping-dependent way. Yet, as we show in the following, our approach allows us to discern the emergence of the trion peak in TA~data, its interplay with the exciton peak, and how these peaks subtly shift in TA~experiments. 

Figure~\ref{fig:TAfit1ps} demonstrates that our approach offers a compelling fit to the TA data at $1$~ps, reproducing the observed shifts, peak splittings, and height changes. Given the minimal, but physics-based, nature of the model, some disagreement may be expected. After all, our baseline correction misses the transient effects of photoinduced BGR. Moreover, even if the linear spectra are well described by this model, there is no guarantee the same holds in the TA. In fact, one can readily observe (even in Fig.~\ref{fig:initial_spectra}(left) before the processing) that the height of the superpeak unexpectedly increases as the potential is lowered from 0.55~V to 0.4~V, before it falls and shifts, as previously observed in the linear spectra. While this might indicate that the MND theory is not applicable here, the fit of Fig.~\ref{fig:TAfit1ps} captures the trend near-quantitatively. 

How can the model accurately capture these TA-specific changes in peak height? The linear spectra are subject to a sum rule where the total oscillator strength is a conserved quantity, and the relative share between trion and exciton is all that changes with carrier density. Our algorithm does not incorporate this rule because TA~does not follow a similar requirement. Inspecting the results of the fit for the $1$~ps data of Fig.~\ref{fig:TAfit1ps} shows that making the potential more negative causes the trion intensity to rise more than it causes the exciton intensity to fall. When combined with the small binding energy at low doping (the peaks begin close together), this allows for the initial growth of the superpeak not observed in the linear spectra. Thus, we can assign this effect to the breaking of the sum rule. 

We now run the fit at each time point over our $>200$~ps of TA data, using the results at the previous time point as the initial guess. This yields a surprising result: the trion appears with positive $\Delta A$ at low doping (see Fig.~\ref{fig:TAresults}(a)). This assignment would be impossible in linear absorption, but contemporaneous theoretical developments suggest that our fitting algorithm is actually yielding physically correct results. To show this we combined the 2D electronic spectroscopy of the MND Hamiltonian\cite{Lindoy2022} with the projection-slice theorem\cite{Hamm2011} to simulate the (early time) TA spectra of the ML-MoS$_2$ MND Hamiltonian. Figure~\ref{fig:TAresults}(c) shows the result of these calculations. While the nonlinear spectroscopic treatment is qualitatively similar to the linear case, the trion exhibits a derivative line shape at low doping that results in positive intensity on the lower energy side of the exciton peak. This outlines the dangers of deconvolving TA~spectra by fitting positive Gaussian peaks, as the pump pulse can brighten and shift the trion peak compared to the linear spectrum, as well as induce interference with the exciton.\cite{Tempelaar2019}

The doping levels are appropriate for the original model Ref.~\onlinecite{Chang2019a} and not the post-optimization Fig.~\ref{fig:TAfit1ps}.}
\end{figure}

We return to our initial query concerning the dynamical shift of the superpeaks in the TA spectra first presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:initial_spectra}(right). As Fig.~\ref{fig:TAresults}(a)~and~(b) illustrate, the exciton and trion peaks both lose intensity over time. This is reasonable, as we expect the relaxation of photoexcited species to lower the TA~bleach signal. We offer further confirmation of this in Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:si1}, which shows that the model's assignment of the doping level is generally stable over time. Moreover, the time series also reveal that both the trion and exciton intensities decay exponentially, with the trion feature decaying faster than the exciton (Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:si2}). This behavior can arise if trions and excitons decay slower than they interconvert: the relaxation or trapping of excitons causes the trion population to collapse as the equilibrium moves to stabilize the ratio of each species.\cite{Huang2022} Such dynamical equilibrium would imply that, as the material relaxes, the superpeak shifts from a position between the exciton and trion signals to being almost entirely atop the exciton peak. 

From this, one can address all aspects of the dynamical shift of Fig.~\ref{fig:initial_spectra}(right). For the $0.25$~V and $0.30$~V spectra, where the trion and exciton begin with similar intensity, the pronounced blueshift is mainly due to this change in relative heights. Indeed, both spectra converge to the high-potential/low-doping superpeak positions at long delay times. Additionally, the trion and exciton positions move with changing doping levels: the exciton is predicted to blueshift with increasing carrier density, while the trion is predicted to redshift. The shift in the underlying peaks thus explains the smaller movement of the superpeak at the highest and lowest doping levels considered, where the signal is dominated by a trion or an exciton, respectively. In general, the total shift has a contribution from both the changing ratio of peak heights and the changing ratio of BGR and BES. We summarize these effects in Fig.~\ref{fig:explanation} for the particular case of the $0.30$~V TA spectrum. 

This simple physical picture also explains why the superpeak redshifts before $1$~ps at intermediate voltages: the doping level is approximately constant (so the exciton and trion positions are fixed) but the formation of quasiparticles from free carriers has not completed.\cite{Ceballos2016, Cunningham2017} While the strongly enhanced absorption characteristic of free carriers is visible, the ratio of excitons to trions has not reached equilibrium. The superpeak redshifts because the trion intensity grows and saturates with time.

\caption{\label{fig:explanation} Cartoon illustration showing the relationship between bandgap, carrier concentration, and exciton/trion absorption peaks as a function of time at a fixed applied potential of $E = 0.3 $~V. The ratio of trion to exciton decreases with time, which causes the superpeak to shift from between the two peaks at $1$~ps to entirely atop of the exciton peak at $25$~ps. The trion peak generally blueshifts over time whereas the exciton remains fairly constant, resulting in a blueshift of the superpeak, as originally observed in Fig~\ref{fig:initial_spectra}.}
\end{figure}

We arrive at a point where the MND~theory of Ref.~\onlinecite{Chang2019a} is in excellent agreement with our experimental steady-state absorbance and TA~data. We believe the explanation developed here also applies to the data in Refs.~\onlinecite{Sie2017,Bera2021} before the onset of the Mott transition. Here, the use of this minimal model to disentangle the spectral signals as a function of potential and time leaves one observation unexplained. For the spectra at the extreme potentials, we claimed that the peak shift is explained by the doping dependence of the exciton or trion signal. Applying the model independently to each time point resulted in deconvolved exciton and trion peak positions that quantitatively agree with the experimental data as a function of time (compare Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:si3} with Fig.~\ref{fig:initial_spectra}(right)). Yet, both exciton and trion peaks net-blueshift in time. This observation fundamentally contradicts the logic that the exciton should blueshift with \textit{increasing} carrier density. Since carrier density decreases with time, the current model cannot accommodate this observation without further extension. We emphasize that, had we applied a data-driven technique, such as SMCR,\cite{Ruckebusch2020, DeJuan2007} without carefully including the physical constraints placed by the underlying Hamiltonian, the optimization procedure would likely have subsumed this subtle effect into a better overall fit; such an approach runs the risk of obtaining an aesthetically pleasing but physically misleading result. 

Several factors can cause the exciton peak to blueshift over time. First, temperature tunes the absorption spectrum and especially the trion signal.\cite{Zhang2014, Christopher2017} Importantly, we neglect nonequilibrium energy relaxation after photon absorption, which leads to changing temperatures and even phonon bottlenecks.\cite{Chi2020,Wang2021h} Ultimately, the timescale required for the lattice to cool the electronic degrees of freedom in comparison to our TA~timescales remains unclear. Second, BGR and BES changes may depend on the identity of the quasiparticles in the system at a particular time.\cite{Cunningham2017} For example, biexcitons,\cite{Li2018c, Trovatello2022, Muir2022} the next-highest-order quasiparticle, are not considered in our model. Finally, while the MND theory assumes holes with infinite mass in the exciton and trion, holes in the real system have an associated momentum.\cite{Qiu2015a} What additional physics is still required to constitute a minimal model therefore remains an open question.

Thus, we have interrogated the ability of trion formation as described by the MND Hamiltonian to explain the salient features in our linear and TA spectra. While a fully \textit{ab initio} treatment of the problem remains beyond the scope of existing theory, we have developed an algorithm to exploit the behavior of the spectra obtained for this model as a function of conduction band population to constrain a minimal parametrization of the data. Our physically meaningful approach captures the evolution of the trion and exciton peaks as a function of applied potential and thus offers a means to critically assess the ability of this model to describe the full range of observed phenomenology. Our results demonstrate that our simple approach is sufficiently robust to interpret, assign, and analyze the spectral features in linear and time-resolved TA spectra of doped ML-TMDs. Importantly, our analysis explains how complex, time-, doping-, and fluence-dependent spectral shifts previously attributed solely to the A-exciton instead arise from the convolution of the emergence and shift of the trion peak and the shift in the exciton peak. The appearance of the trion at room temperature, under working conditions, suggests that a model of TMD photophysics restricted to BGR and BES is insufficient to capture both static and dynamic spectral signatures, and that the trion state must therefore be included in the minimal theoretical framework for spectroscopic measurements of TMD-containing systems.

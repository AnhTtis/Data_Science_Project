    "abstract": "In this work, we study a particular system of coagulation equations characterized by two values, namely volume $v$ and surface area $a$. Compared to the standard one-dimensional models, this model incorporates additional information about the geometry of the particles. We describe the coagulation process as a combination between collision and fusion of particles. We prove that we are able to recover the standard one-dimensional coagulation model when fusion happens quickly and that we are able to recover an equation in which particles interact and form a ramified-like system in time when fusion happens slowly.",

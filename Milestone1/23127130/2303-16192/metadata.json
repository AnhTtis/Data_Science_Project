    "abstract": "Using an efficient polynomial-time ground state algorithm we investigate the Ising spin glass state at zero temperature in two dimensions. For large sizes, we show that the spin state in a central region is independent of the interactions far away, indicating a ``single-state\" picture, presumably the droplet model. Surprisingly, a single power law describes corrections to this result down to the smallest sizes studied.",

%% article.
\begin{abstract}
As machine learning-enabled Text-to-Image (TTI) systems are becoming increasingly prevalent and seeing growing adoption as commercial services, characterizing the social biases they exhibit is a necessary first step to lowering their risk of discriminatory outcomes. This evaluation, however, is made more difficult by the synthetic nature of these systems' outputs: common definitions of diversity are grounded in social categories of people living in the world, whereas the artificial depictions of fictive humans created by these systems have no inherent gender or ethnicity. 
%since artificial depictions of fictive humans have no inherent gender or ethnicity nor do they belong to socially-constructed groups, we need to look beyond common categorizations of diversity or representation.
% 
To address this need, we propose a new method for exploring the social biases in TTI systems. Our approach relies on characterizing the variation in generated images triggered by enumerating gender and ethnicity markers in the prompts, and comparing it to the variation engendered by spanning different professions.
% directly comparing variations in collections of generated images designed to span a range of gender and ethnicity markers in the prompts to collections where the prompt sets covered various professions and gender-coded adjectives.
% directly comparing collections of generated images designed to showcase a system's variation across textual mentions of gender and ethnicity markers and professions and gender-coded adjectives.
This allows us to (1)~identify specific bias trends, (2)~provide targeted scores to directly compare models in terms of diversity and representation, and (3)~jointly model interdependent social variables to support a multidimensional analysis.
We leverage this method to analyze images generated by 3 popular TTI systems (\DallE, Stable Diffusion v~1.4 and 2) and find that while all of their outputs show correlations with US labor demographics, they also consistently under-represent marginalized identities to different extents.
We also release the datasets and low-code interactive bias exploration platforms developed for this work, as well as the necessary tools to similarly evaluate additional TTI systems.

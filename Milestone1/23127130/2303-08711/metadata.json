    "abstract": "At leading-order, the standard dilute-dense Color Glass Condensate formula used for two-particle correlations in proton-nucleus collisions, whose symmetries prevent the generation of odd azimuthal anisotropy harmonics, is the dilute projectile limit of the dense-dense formalism. However, when the projectile is genuinely dilute, the complete formulation contains additional contributions at the same leading order in the strong coupling constant. In this work we investigate those low projectile density contributions that are relevant when the particles are produced at forward rapidities. We find that they are responsible for non-zero odd harmonics which are negative, in qualitative agreement with recent experimental measurements at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.",

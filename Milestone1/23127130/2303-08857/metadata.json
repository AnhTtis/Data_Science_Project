    "abstract": "We report on a novel approach to dynamic compression of materials that bridges the gap between previous static- and dynamic- compression techniques, allowing to explore a wide range of pathways in the pressure-temperature space. By combining a dynamic-diamond anvil cell setup with double-sided laser-heating and in situ X-ray diffraction, we are able to perform dynamic compression at high temperature and characterize structural transitions with unprecedented time resolution. Using this method, we investigate the $γ-ε$ phase transition of iron under dynamic compression for the first time, reaching compression rates of hundreds of GPa/s and temperatures of 2000 K. Our results demonstrate a distinct response of the $γ-ε$ and $α-ε$ transitions to the high compression rates achieved. These findings open up new avenues to study tailored dynamic compression pathways in the pressure-temperature space and highlight the potential of this platform to capture kinetic effects in a diamond anvil cell.",

abstract = {{Single crystal iron was ramp-compressed along the [100] axis at 4 GPa/ns through the $alpha$-$epsilon$ phase transformation at 13 GPa. Unlike shock experiments, in these ramp compression experiments the bcc lattice is observed to be nearly isotropically relaxed before the phase transition. There was a mixed $alpha$/$epsilon$ phase region starting at about 13 GPa, which was observed for 0.75 ns until the peak stress of 18 GPa was reached. In situ x-ray diffraction measurements show the formation of new hcp orientations not reported in shock or quasistatic compression experiments. The new hcp orientations appear to be caused by sequential twins that occur during the phase transition. This twinning mechanism relieves the shear strain caused by the bcc-hcp phase transition from the isotropically relaxed bcc phase while subject to uniaxial compression. These results show that in iron the induced microstructure through a phase transition and the phase transition mechanism depend on the loading history.}},

As in previous work, we observe a plateau in the rear surface velocity profile at the transition. With increasing deformation rate the transition onset pressure raises from 11 to 25 GPa, while the plateau duration decreases. These kinetic effects are well reproduced by an Avrami-type kinetics model of nucleation and growth with a constant, nanosecond scale completion time, which suggests an isokinetic regime over the explored range of strain rates.}},

@article{Campbell2007,
   abstract = {Partial melting in the Fe-S system was investigated at high pressures because of its importance to understanding the formation, composition, and thermal structure of the Earth's core. Earlier studies at very high pressure (>25 GPa) took place before the discovery of Fe3S, which compromised the interpretation of those results. Furthermore, they relied on textural criteria for melting that are difficult to apply at high pressure. In this study synchrotron X-ray diffraction was used to monitor coexisting metal and sulfide at high pressures and temperatures, during laser heating in a diamond anvil cell. The criterion for melting was the disappearance of one of the two coexisting phases, and reappearance upon quench. Temperatures of eutectic melting between Fe and Fe3S were bracketed in this way up to 60 GPa, and a lower bound was established at 80 GPa. The accuracy of the melting point measured in these studies was improved through modelling of the axial temperature distribution through the thickness of the sample; this indicated a ∼6% correction to the spectroradiometrically determined temperature. The Fe-Fe3S eutectic composition remains close to 15 wt% S up to 60 GPa. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We observe a decrease in melting temperature with increasing Si content over the entire investigated pressure range. This trend is used to discuss the melting curve of pure Fe. Moreover, our measurements of eutectic melting in the Fe-Fe3S system show a change in slope around 50 GPa concomitant with the fcc-hcp phase transition in pure solid iron. Extrapolations of our melting curve up to the core-mantle boundary pressure yield values of 3,600-3,750 K for the freezing temperature of plausible outer core compositions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Because of the nanosecond time scales in shock experiments, real-time in situ observations of shock-induced lattice defects have been challenging. Here, we present synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements on laser-shock-compressed gold that provide the first unambiguous in situ measurements of stacking faults (SFs), likely formed by partial dislocations, during shock compression. SF abundance increases monotonically with shock compression up to 150 GPa, where SFs comprise almost every 6th atomic layer.

Specifically, in its elemental form, crystals of remarkable purity can be produced. One may assume that this would lead to silicon being well understood, and indeed, this is the case for many ambient properties, as well as for higher-pressure behaviour under quasi-static loading. However, despite many decades of study, a detailed understanding of the response of silicon to rapid compression—such as that experienced under shock impact—remains elusive. Here, we combine a novel free-electron laser-based X-ray diffraction geometry with laser-driven compression to elucidate the importance of shear generated during shock compression on the occurrence of phase transitions. We observe lowering of the hydrostatic phase boundary in elemental silicon, an ideal model system for investigating high-strength materials, analogous to planetary constituents. Moreover, we unambiguously determine the onset of melting above 14 GPa, previously ascribed to a solid–solid phase transition, undetectable in the now conventional shocked diffraction geometry; transitions to the liquid state are expected to be ubiquitous in all systems at sufficiently high pressures and temperatures. In spite of its wide technological use, the response of silicon to rapid compression remains poorly understood. By means of an X-ray diffraction method based on a free-electron laser, the process for laser-driven dynamic shock compression is now elucidated in this system.}},

However, a detailed understanding of processes involved in the high temperature alpha-Fe ↔ γ-Fe and the high pressure alpha-Fe ↔ epsilon-Fe transformations is still lacking. In this study, we monitored in situ the orientations and mobility of the interfaces of coexistence of parent and daughter phases of iron upon transitions around the alpha−γ−epsilon triple point. We show that in alpha-Fe ↔ epsilon-Fe transitions, a displacive mechanism induces typical martensitic microstructures, but is followed by a second likely reconstructive step which transforms most of the sample. Under similar pressure, temperature and heating rate conditions, alpha-Fe ↔ γ-Fe transformations appear to be purely reconstructive. This work provides for the first time a complete 3D microstructural in situ characterization of iron structural transitions under extreme conditions that clarifies their fundamental mechanisms.}

ABSTRACT = {The high-pressure, high-temperature behavior of iron was investigated to 140 GPa and 3500 K with in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Iron samples were compressed in diamond-anvil cells and heated up with the double-sided laser-heating system installed at the high-pressure ID27 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Three different structures, namely &alpha;-bcc, &gamma;-fcc or &epsilon;-hcp Fe were identified as a function of pressure and temperature in the domain we explored. At pressures above 90 GPa, it is clearly shown that &epsilon;-iron is the single stable solid phase up to 160 GPa at high temperatures. The analysis of the P-V-T relationship allows us to propose a reliable experimental thermal equation of state (EoS) for iron. We also show that the addition of low pressure points to our EoS refinement yields more robust constrain on the determination of the reference volume V0 of the &epsilon;-hcp structure, which has important implications on the final parametrization of the equation of state. The extrapolation of the proposed EoS to core pressure conditions indicates that a pure iron core would have an excess of density of 3% compared to the PREM density profile.},

abstract = {{Summary. The phase diagram of iron up to 330 GPa is solved using the experimental data of static high pressure (up to 11 GPa) and the experimental data of shock wave data (up to 250 GPa). A solution for the highest triple point is found (P= 280 GPa and T= 5760 K) by imposing the thermodynamic constraints of triple points. This pressure of the triple point is less than the pressure of the inner core–outer core boundary of the Earth. These results indicate that the density of iron at the inner core–outer core boundary pressure is close to 13 g cm−3, which lies close to the seismic solutions of the Earth at that pressure. It is thus concluded that the Earth's inner core is very likely to be virtually pure iron in its hexagonal close packed (hcp) phase. It is shown that four properties of the Earth's inner core determined from seismology are close in value to the corresponding properties of hcp iron at inner core conditions: density, bulk modulus, longitudinal velocity, and Poisson's ratio. The density–pressure profile of hcp iron at inner core conditions matches the density–pressure profile of the inner core as determined by seismic methods, within the spread of values given by recent seismic models. This indicates that the Earth is slowly cooling, the Earth's inner core is growing by crystallization, and the impurities of the core are concentrated in the outer core. The calculated temperature at the Earth's centre is 6450 K.}},

Knowledge of the behaviour of matter under conditions of extreme pressure is essential for describing the interior state of giant planets such as Jupiter and many extrasolar planets. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California is pursuing laboratory astrophysics with shock-free dynamic (ramp) compression up to 50 million atmospheres pressure. Working with the NIF at temperatures below those used in fusion experiments, Raymond Smith and colleagues have achieved a new experimental benchmark in the replication of conditions deep within giant planets. They describe properties of carbon compressed to an unprecedented density of 12 g cm−3. These results also provide some of the most direct experimental tests of quantum-statistical theories developed in the early days of quantum mechanics. The recent discovery of more than a thousand planets outside our Solar System1,2, together with the significant push to achieve inertially confined fusion in the laboratory3, has prompted a renewed interest in how dense matter behaves at millions to billions of atmospheres of pressure. The theoretical description of such electron-degenerate matter has matured since the early quantum statistical model of Thomas and Fermi4,5,6,7,8,9,10, and now suggests that new complexities can emerge at pressures where core electrons (not only valence electrons) influence the structure and bonding of matter11. Recent developments in shock-free dynamic (ramp) compression now allow laboratory access to this dense matter regime. Here we describe ramp-compression measurements for diamond, achieving 3.7-fold compression at a peak pressure of 5 terapascals (equivalent to 50 million atmospheres). These equation-of-state data can now be compared to first-principles density functional calculations12 and theories long used to describe matter present in the interiors of giant planets, in stars, and in inertial-confinement fusion experiments. Our data also provide new constraints on mass–radius relationships for carbon-rich planets.}},

One of the intriguing questions that are rarely discussed is the comparison between quasi-isentropic response and adiabatic response for copper lattice transition. The ambient face-centered-cubic structure of Cu is predicted to persist over 100 TPa from ab inito calculations and experimentally demonstrated to persist until 1.15 TPa in ramp compression and 150 GPa in static compression. However, a novel body-centered-cubic (BCC) order is observed merely at 180 GPa once shock compression is applied. The mechanism of body-centered-cubic phase transition occurred at low pressure under shock compression remains elusive so far and much attention is required on the dynamics in such a phase transition. In this work, we utilize the molecular dynamics method to simulate the shock compression on a copper lattice to uncover the structural transition in the atomic scale. We report the FCC–BCC phase transition occurred at 156 GPa, and lots of disordered structures are discovered in the BCC phase after impact, revealed by a series of structure analysis tools and free energy calculations. The plethora of transient disordered structures reduces the global Gibbs free energies, thus leading to the downgrade of the transition pressure in contrast to the ramp and static compression, which provides a new perspective for structural transformation under extreme conditions.}},

It is found that the shear deformation can lower the transition pressure notably, and even change the nucleation structure and morphology. Under 1D-dominated compression (along (001) direction), there only appears hcp nucleation with a few fcc stacking faults. For other cases, more equivalent planes will be activated and fcc structure begins to nucleate.

The objective of the current work was to perform plate impact experiments to examine the shock response of polycrystalline and single crystal iron with nanosecond resolution for impact stresses spanning the alpha-epsilon transition. The current data reveal an orientation dependence of the transition stress coupled with a transition time that is nonlinearly dependent on the impact stress with a duration ranging from picoseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds. The higher transition stress for iron shocked along the [100] direction is in agreement with the predictions from MD calculations that describe an orientation dependence of the transition stress. However, MD calculations do not capture the complexity of the continuum states achieved or the transition kinetics. Further results and implications are discussed in this paper.}},

Here, we present a detailed shape analysis of the diffraction peaks using a modified Warren-Averbach method to quantify the microstructure of shock-compressed high-pressure iron. The epsilon phase was determined through this method to have grain sizes between 2 and 15 nm, in reasonable agreement with results from large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations. We conclude that single-crystal iron becomes nanocrystalline in shock transforming from alpha to epsilon phase.}},

In the two-phase region above 13 GPa, the Hugoniot lies well above the equilibrium surface defined by Galpha =Gɛ , with G the Gibbs free energy. Also, the phase transition relaxation time τ is uncertain, with estimates ranging from <50 ns to ≈180 ns. Here we present an extensive study of these important aspects, metastability and dynamics, of the alpha-ɛ transition in iron. Our primary theoretical tools are (a) accurate theoretically based free energies for alpha and ɛ phases of iron and (b) accurate calculations of the wave evolution following planar impacts. We define metastable surfaces for forward and reverse transitions by the condition that the thermodynamic driving force Galpha -Gɛ is just balanced by an opposing force resulting from elastic stresses, and we calibrate the forward surface from the Hugoniot and the reverse surface from the phase interface reflection feature of shock profiles. These metastable surfaces, corresponding to alpha⇆ɛ transitions proceeding at a rate of tens of nanoseconds, are in remarkable agreement with quasistatic diamond cell measurements. When the relaxation time τ is calibrated from the rise time of the P2 wave, our calculated wave profiles are in good agreement with VISAR data. The overall comparison of theory and experiment indicates that (a) τ depends on shock strength and is approximately 60→12 ns for shocks of 17→30 GPa, and (b) while τ expresses linear irreversible-thermodynamic relaxation, some nonlinear relaxation must also be present in the shock process in iron.}},

These methods allow for compression on timescales ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds and can often achieve substantially higher pressure than earlier gas-gun-based loading techniques. The capability to produce shockless (i.e., ramp) compression provides access to new regimes of pressure–temperature space and new diagnostics allow for a more detailed understanding of the structure and physical properties of materials under dynamic loading.

A Lagrangian sound-speed analysis was used to determine pressure, density and sound speed along a continuous isentropic compression path. Our peak pressures are comparable to those predicted at the centre of a terrestrial-type exoplanet of three to four Earth masses3, representing the first absolute equation of state measurements for iron at such conditions. These results provide an experiment-based mass–radius relationship for a hypothetical pure iron planet that can be used to evaluate plausible compositional space for large, rocky exoplanets. Iron has been ramp compressed to the pressures it would experience in the core of a 3–4 Earth-mass terrestrial exoplanet, providing experimental constraints on the mass–radius relationship for a hypothetical pure iron planet.}},

   abstract = {Detector systems introduce distortions into acquired data. To obtain accurate angle and intensity information, it is necessary to calibrate, and apply corrections. Intensity non-linearity, spatial distortion, and non-uniformity of intensity response, are the primary considerations. It is better to account for the distortions within scientific analysis software, but often it is more practical to correct the distortions to produce 'idealised' data. Calibration methods and software have been developed for single crystal diffraction experiments, using both approaches. For powder diffraction experiments the additional task of converting a two-dimensional image to a one-dimensional spectrum is used to allow Rietveld analysis. This task may be combined with distortion correction to produce intensity information and error estimates. High-pressure experiments can introduce additional complications and place new demands on software. Flexibility is needed to be able to integrate different angular regions separately, and to produce profiles as a function of angle of azimuth. Methods to cope with awkward data are described, and examples of the techniques applied to data from high pressure experiments are presented.},

abstract = {In situ x-ray diffraction experiments on iron at pressures of 22–32 GPa and temperatures of 300–1500 K were carried out using an MA8-type high-pressure apparatus, employing sintered diamond anvils, combined with synchrotron radiation. No phases other than epsilon(hcp) and γ(fcc) were observed in this pressure and temperature range. It became clear that non-hydrostaticity or chemical reaction with hydrogen causes serious problems in high-pressure and high-temperature x-ray diffraction study on iron. The average thermal expansivity of epsilon phase between 300 K and 1000 K and the zero-pressure bulk modulus of γ phase at 1400 K were determined by assuming that no chemical reaction occurred in the present study. The thermal expansivities of epsilon iron at 22 GPa and 32 GPa are determined to be 3.88 × 10−5 K−1 and 3.16 × 10−5 K−1, respectively. In this case, the volume at 22–32 GPa and room temperature is about 1\% larger than the literature value. The bulk modulus of γ iron is determined to be 120 GPa, when its pressure derivative is fixed at 5.},

Diagnostics such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray phase contrast imaging (PCI) are being employed in-line with dynamic loading platforms for studying dynamic phenomena such as phase transitions, microstructural evolution, etc. Here we study the well-known polymorphic phase transformation (alpha- epsilon phase) in polycrystalline iron through front-surface plate impact experiments using dynamic X-ray diffraction techniques at the Dynamic Compression Sector at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) The impact stress state of the iron samples were measured using optical velocimetry techniques The window correction for Lexan™ was also investigated since this material was used as the impact surface and optical window in the experimental configuration described here, and has been shown to be useful as a window material for other dynamic XRD measurements. X-ray diffraction data show that at impact stresses near the known transition stress for polycrystalline iron (13 GPa), we begin to see evidence of the transition to the higher pressure epsilon phase (hcp). Although additional experiments are needed to observe the complete transformation to the epsilon-phase, this work provides the first XRD data for iron obtained in plate impact experiments that provide insight into this well-known transition.},

@article{Fischer2015,
   abstract = {The Earth's iron-rich inner core is seismically anisotropic, which may be due to the preferred orientation of Fe-rich hexagonal close packed (hcp) alloy crystals. Elastic anisotropy in a hexagonal crystal is related to its c/a axial ratio; therefore, it is important to know how this ratio depends on volume (or pressure), temperature, and composition. Experimental data on the axial ratio of iron and alloys in the Fe-Ni-Si system from 15 previous studies are combined here to parameterize the effects of these variables. The axial ratio increases with increasing volume, temperature, silicon content, and nickel content. When an hcp phase coexists with another structure, sample recovery and chemical analysis from each pressure-temperature point is one method for determining the phase's composition and thus the position of the phase boundary. An alternate method is demonstrated here, using this parameterization to calculate the composition of an hcp phase whose volume, temperature, and axial ratio are measured. The hcp to hcp+B2 phase boundary in the Fe-FeSi system is parameterized as a function of pressure, temperature, and composition, showing that a silicon-rich inner core may be an hcp+B2 mixture. These findings could help explain observations of a layered seismic anisotropy structure in the Earth's inner core.},

   abstract = {It is qualitatively well known that kinetics related to nucleation and growth can shift apparent phase boundaries from their equilibrium value. In this work, we have measured this effect in Bi using time-resolved X-ray diffraction with unprecedented 0.25 ms time resolution, accurately determining phase transition pressures at compression rates spanning five orders of magnitude (10-2-10 3 GPa/s) using the dynamic diamond anvil cell. An over-pressurization of the Bi-III/Bi-V phase boundary is observed at fast compression rates for different sample types and stress states, and the largest over-pressurization that is observed is ΔP = 2.5 GPa. The work presented here paves the way for future studies of transition kinetics at previously inaccessible compression rates. Bismuth, a high-Z metal that has a remarkably complex phase diagram at relatively low pressures and temperatures , has been extensively studied using conventional static and dynamic compression techniques. Recent time-resolved X-ray diffraction studies of shock-and ramp-compressed samples have revealed interesting compression rate dependent phenomena such as shifts of phase transition boundaries 1 , the formation of metasta-ble phases 2,3 , and the adoption of alternative phase-transforming pathways 2-4. In order to identify the driving forces that result in deviations from the equilibrium phase diagram, it is necessary to understand the impact of phase transition kinetics over a wide range of compression rates. However, traditional dynamic compression (e.g. laser-driven and gas gun) experiments are performed at strain rates higher than 10 5 s −1 , which are over 5 orders of magnitude larger than those experienced during static compression. Consequently, the behavior of Bi at intermediate strain rates remains essentially unexplored. Access to this strain-rate regime is possible using piezo-driven dynamic diamond anvil cells (dDACs), which can generate compression rates up to 160 TPa/s (strain rates of ~ 10 2 s −1) 5. However, studies utilizing this technique are still scarce, with many relying on indirect methods of structural determination 6-10. More recently, improvements in detector technology allow for the collection of time-resolved X-ray diffraction data from dynamically-compressed samples at kHz repetition rates 5 , which offers sufficient time resolution to accurately pinpoint phase transitions pressures up to ~ 1000 GPa/s. Static compression studies reported Bi to transform to several different high-pressure polymorphs with well-characterized crystal structures on compression 11. The monoclinic Bi-II structure has a narrow stability field (2.5-2.8 GPa), with Bi adopting the incommensurate 'host-guest' Bi-III structure between 2.8 and 7.7 GPa before transforming to the body-centered cubic (bcc) Bi-V at higher pressures 11. A series of displacive atomic mechanisms have been proposed for structural pathways relating the high pressure polymorphs of Bi 12 ; the reconstructive Bi-I/Bi-II transition was described as proceeding through a primitive cubic superstructure, whereas displacive mechanisms were proposed for the Bi-II/Bi-III and Bi-III/Bi-V transitions. However, these have not been experimentally verified or investigated using computational methods. Early shock-compression studies saw evidence of phase transitions at pressures consistent with results from static compression studies 13-15 , although the methods used to identify these transitions did not yield any structural information. Ramp compression experiments reported a strain-rate dependence of the Bi-I/Bi-II phase boundary, exhibiting a significant shift to higher pressures above 5 × 10 6 s −1 strain rates 1. More recently, time-resolved X-ray diffraction experiments of dynamically-compressed Bi using XFELs and synchrotron techniques OPEN},

   abstract = {Silicon (Si) is one of the most abundant elements on Earth, and it is the most widely used semiconductor. Despite extensive study, some properties of Si, such as its behaviour under dynamic compression, remain elusive. A detailed understanding of Si deformation is crucial for various fields, ranging from planetary science to materials design. Simulations suggest that in Si the shear stress generated during shock compression is released via a high-pressure phase transition, challenging the classical picture of relaxation via defect-mediated plasticity. However, direct evidence supporting either deformation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we use sub-picosecond, highly-monochromatic x-ray diffraction to study (100)-oriented single-crystal Si under laser-driven shock compression. We provide the first unambiguous, time-resolved picture of Si deformation at ultra-high strain rates, demonstrating the predicted shear release via phase transition. Our results resolve the longstanding controversy on silicon deformation and provide direct proof of strain rate-dependent deformation mechanisms in a non-metallic system. The response of materials to ultrahigh pressures has been investigated for more than a century 1-9 , fostering our understanding of the fundamental properties of matter as well as the phenomena taking place at the interior of planets within our own solar system and beyond 10-13. Si is one of the most abundant elements in our planet, and it has found wide-ranging application in the semiconductor industry. Because of its technological interest, Si properties have been extensively studied, both at ambient and high-pressure (HP) conditions 14-16. However, despite decades of research, there is no consensus around the deformation mechanism that drives Si transitions at HP. Precise understanding of these transformation pathways is of interest for fields ranging from planetary science 17 to the recovery of novel functional materials for industrial and energetic applications 18-21. Si exhibits a complex phase diagram, with several HP and meta-stable polymorphs 14. Under static loading, upon increasing pressure Si-I transforms into metallic β − tin Si-II, Imma Si-XI, sh Si-V, Cmca Si-VI, hcp Si-VII and fcc SiX 22-29. Under dynamic loading, Si displays a complex response that has been a matter of debate for decades 30-32 , with a multi-wave profile emerging between 5.4 and 9.2 GPa depending upon crystal orientation and strain rate. Velocimetry experiments have identified the wave following elastic deformation with the onset of a plastic 33,34 or inelastic 35-37 regime, followed by a HP phase transition. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations have suggested that, for dynamic compression of Si, HP phase transitions can occur inelastically rather than via defect-mediated plasticity. That is to say that in Si the relaxation from a purely uniaxial elastic compression to a more hydrostatic state does not happen via defect motion per se 38 , and the shear stress is released via the phase transition itself. Thus, there is not an intermediate plastic deformation regime, and the generation and motion of defects follow the phase transition rather than preceding it;},

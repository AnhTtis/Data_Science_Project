Mobile cloud computing can address these problems by executing mobile applications on resource providers external to the mobile device. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey of mobile cloud computing research, while highlighting the specific concerns in mobile cloud computing. We present a taxonomy based on the key issues in this area, and discuss the different approaches taken to tackle these issues. We conclude the paper with a critical analysis of challenges that have not yet been fully met, and highlight directions for future work."

abstract="Federated learning is an emerging collaborative machine-learning paradigm for training models directly on edge devices. The data remains on the edge device and this method is robust under real-world edge data distributions. We present a new asynchronous federated-learning algorithm (`asynchronous federated learning') and study its convergence rate when distributed across many edge devices, with hard data constraints, relative to training the same model on a single device. We compare asynchronous federated learning to an existing synchronous method. We evaluate its robustness in real-world situations; for example, devices joining part-way through training or devices with heterogeneous compute resources. We then apply asynchronous federated learning to a challenging geospatial application, namely image-based geolocation using a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network. Our results lay the groundwork for deploying large-scale federated learning as a tool to automatically learn, and continually update, a machine-learned model that encodes location.",

abstract = {Machine-learning ML enables computers to learn how to recognise patterns, make unintended decisions, or react to a dynamic environment. The effectiveness of trained machines varies because of more suitable ML algorithms or because superior training sets. Although ML algorithms are known and publicly released, training sets may not be reasonably ascertainable and, indeed, may be guarded as trade secrets. In this paper we focus our attention on ML classifiers and on the statistical information that can be unconsciously or maliciously revealed from them. We show that it is possible to infer unexpected but useful information from ML classifiers. In particular, we build a novel meta-classifier and train it to hack other classifiers, obtaining meaningful information about their training sets. Such information leakage can be exploited, for example, by a vendor to build more effective classifiers or to simply acquire trade secrets from a competitor's apparatus, potentially violating its intellectual property rights.},

This book is ideal for programmers looking to analyze datasets of any size, and for administrators who want to set up and run Hadoop clusters. Using Hadoop 2 exclusively, author Tom White presents new chapters on YARN and several Hadoop-related projects such as Parquet, Flume, Crunch, and Spark. You'll learn about recent changes to Hadoop, and explore new case studies on Hadoop's role in healthcare systems and genomics data processing.}

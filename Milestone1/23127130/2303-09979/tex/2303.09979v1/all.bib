abstract = {Pair atomic density fitting (PADF) is a promising strategy to reduce the scaling with system size of quantum chemical methods for the calculation of the correlation energy like the direct random phase approximation (RPA) or second-order M{\{}$\backslash$o{\}}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). PADF can however introduce large errors in correlation energies as the two-electron interaction energy is not guaranteed to be bounded from below. This issue can be partially alleviated by using very large fit sets, but this comes at the price of reduced efficiency and having to deal with near-linear dependencies in the fit set. In this work, we introduce an alternative methodology to overcome this problem that preserves the intrinsically favourable scaling of PADF. We first regularize the Fock matrix by projecting out parts of the basis set which gives rise to orbital products that are hard to describe by PADF. We then also apply this projector to the orbital coefficient matrix to improve the precision of PADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA. We systematically assess the accuracy of this new approach in a numerical atomic orbital framework using Slater Type Orbitals (STO) and correlation consistent Gaussian type basis sets up to quintuple-{\$}\backslashzeta{\$} quality for systems with more than 200 atoms. For the small and medium systems in the S66 database we show the maximum deviation of PADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA relative correlation energies to DF-MP2 and DF-RPA reference results to be 0.07 and 0.14 kcal/mol respectively. When the new projector method is used, the errors only slightly increase for large molecules and also when moderately sized fit sets are used the resulting errors are well under control. Finally, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of our algorithm by calculating the interaction energies of non-covalently bound complexes with more than 1000 atoms and 20000 atomic orbitals at the RPA@PBE/CC-pVTZ level of theory.},

@article{Ma2018,
abstract = {A well-parallelized perturbative triples correction implementation for the pair natural orbital based coupled cluster method PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12 is presented. A composite approach is adopted in addressing the coupling due to off-diagonal Fock matrix elements, in which the local triples amplitudes are iteratively solved using small domains of triples natural orbitals, and a semicanonical (T0) domain correction with larger domains is applied to reduce the domain errors. This treatment adds only about 20{\%} to the computational cost of (T0) calculations with large domains, and the errors due to the use of small domains in the iterations are very small. In addition, a two-step triple list selection method is applied: First, an initial triple list is generated using LCCSD-F12 pair energy criteria, and the (T0) triples energies are computed using small domains. Second, this list is reduced by neglecting triples with small energy contributions, and the final calculation with large domains is only carried out for the reduced list. The cost of the (T) calculation scales asymptotically linear with the molecular size and shows excellent parallelization efficiency up to hundreds of CPU cores. The convergence of the (T) contribution to the relative energies of large molecular systems is carefully tested, and for most of the cases the results obtained with our default thresholds agree within ∼0.5 kcal mol-1 with those computed with very tight thresholds. For all tested molecular systems where canonical calculations are still feasible, the PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12 relative energies also agree within 0.5 kcal mol-1 with the canonical CCSD(T)-F12 results using the same F12 treatment. The (T) calculation generally takes 3-5 times the cost of the preceding PNO-LCCSD-F12 calculation, primarily due to the large number of triples required in obtaining accurate relative energies. We find that for large molecular systems the triple selection criteria used in previous local triples methods are insufficient, and a much larger number of triples are required than it was assumed so far. Still, using a commodity computer cluster, the PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12 calculation of molecules with ∼100 atoms using augmented triple-$\zeta$ basis sets can be carried out in a few hours of elapsed time.},

@article{Ayala2001,
abstract = {We present an atomic-orbital formulation of second-order M{\o}ller–Plesset (MP2) theory for periodic systems. Our formulation is shown to have several advantages over the conventional crystalline orbital formulation. Notably, the inherent spatial decay properties of the density matrix and the atomic orbital basis are exploited to reduce computational cost and scaling. The multidimensional k-space integration is replaced by independent Fourier transforms of weighted density matrices. The computational cost of the correlation correction becomes independent of the number of k-points used. Focusing on the MP2 quasiparticleenergyband gap, we also show using an isolated fragment model that the long range gap contributions decay rapidly as 1/R 5 , proof that band gap corrections converge rapidly with respect to lattice summation. The correlated amplitudes in the atomic orbital (AO) basis are obtained in a closed-form fashion, compatible with a semidirect algorithm, thanks to the Laplace transform of the energy denominator. Like for its molecular counterpart, the Laplace quadrature can be accurately carried out by using few quadrature points, 3–7 depending on the application. In particular, MP2 quasiparticleenergyband gaps are computed accurately with 3 Laplace quadrature points. All these traits indicate that robust calculations of the correlation correction to the Hartree–Fock (HF) energy and band gap of large systems can be carried out. We present benchmark periodic MP2 calculations on polyacetylene, polyphenylenevinylene, hexagonal boron nitride, and stacked polyacetylene.},

@article{Sirohiwal2020a,
abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) is a multisubunit pigment-protein complex that uses light-induced charge separation to power oxygenic photosynthesis. Its reaction center chromophores, where the charge transfer cascade is initiated, are arranged symmetrically along the D1 and D2 core polypeptides and comprise four chlorophyll (PD1, PD2, ChlD1, ChlD2) and two pheophytin molecules (PheoD1 and PheoD2). Evolution favored productive electron transfer only via the D1 branch, with the precise nature of primary excitation and the factors that control asymmetric charge transfer remaining under investigation. Here we present a detailed atomistic description for both. We combine large-scale simulations of membrane-embedded PSII with high-level quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) calculations of individual and coupled reaction center chromophores to describe reaction center excited states. We employ both range-separated time-dependent density functional theory and the recently developed domain based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) implementation of the similarity transformed equation of motion coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations (STEOM-CCSD), the first coupled cluster QM/MM calculations of the reaction center. We find that the protein matrix is exclusively responsible for both transverse (chlorophylls versus pheophytins) and lateral (D1 versus D2 branch) excitation asymmetry, making ChlD1 the chromophore with the lowest site energy. Multipigment calculations show that the protein matrix renders the ChlD1 → PheoD1 charge-transfer the lowest energy excitation globally within the reaction center, lower than any pigment-centered local excitation. Remarkably, no low-energy charge transfer states are located within the "special pair"PD1-PD2, which is therefore excluded as the site of initial charge separation in PSII. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that modulation of the electrostatic environment due to protein conformational flexibility enables direct excitation of low-lying charge transfer states by far-red light.},

@article{Hirata2017,
abstract = {A thorough analytical and numerical characterization of the whole perturbation series of one-particle many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory is presented in a pedagogical manner. Three distinct but equivalent algebraic (first-quantized) recursive definitions of the perturbation series of the Green's function are derived, which can be combined with the well-known recursion for the self-energy. Six general-order algorithms of MBGF are developed, each implementing one of the three recursions, the $\Delta$MPn method (where n is the perturbation order) [S. Hirata et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 11, 1595 (2015)], the automatic generation and interpretation of diagrams, or the numerical differentiation of the exact Green's function with a perturbation-scaled Hamiltonian. They all display the identical, nondivergent perturbation series except $\Delta$MPn, which agrees with MBGF in the diagonal and frequency-independent approximations at 1≤n≤3 but converges at the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limit at n=∞ (unless it diverges). Numerical data of the perturbation series are presented for Koopmans and non-Koopmans states to quantify the rate of convergence towards the FCI limit and the impact of the diagonal, frequency-independent, or $\Delta$MPn approximation. The diagrammatic linkedness and thus size-consistency of the one-particle Green's function and self-energy are demonstrated at any perturbation order on the basis of the algebraic recursions in an entirely time-independent (frequency-domain) framework. The trimming of external lines in a one-particle Green's function to expose a self-energy diagram and the removal of reducible diagrams are also justified mathematically using the factorization theorem of Frantz and Mills. Equivalence of $\Delta$MPn and MBGF in the diagonal and frequency-independent approximations at 1≤n≤3 is algebraically proven, also ascribing the differences at n = 4 to the so-called semi-reducible and linked-disconnected diagrams.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed an increasing interaction between experiment and theory in the field of molecular spectroscopy. On the computational side, ongoing developments of hardware and software have moved computational spectroscopy from a highly specialized research area to a general tool for researchers in different fields of chemical science. However, since its dawn, computational spectroscopy has been characterized by the dichotomies of qualitative and quantitative description, and of interpretation and accuracy. Indeed, the analysis of experiments is seldom straightforward because of the subtle interplay of several different effects, which are not easy to evaluate and isolate, and/or the complexity of the system under consideration. Often, the accuracy has to be set aside for a more qualitative analysis that will provide the means for a broad interpretation. In such a scenario, the most recent advances in theoretical treatments as well as computational tools have opened the way to the reconciliation of accuracy and interpretability, resulting in unequivocal analyses and assignments of experimental spectra and their unbiased interpretation. This Review aims at being a comprehensive, authoritative, critical, and readable account of general interest to the chemistry community because of the wealth of qualitative and quantitative information that can be obtained from spectroscopic investigations. Limiting ourselves to rotational and vibrational spectroscopy, emphasis will be put on accuracy and interpretability as well as on the routes toward their reconciliation and integration.},

abstract = {The equilibrium association free enthalpies $\Delta$Ga for typical supramolecular complexes in solution are calculated by ab initio quantum chemical methods. Ten neutral and three positively charged complexes with experimental $\Delta$Ga values in the range 0 to -21 kcal mol -1 (on average -6 kcal mol-1) are investigated. The theoretical approach employs a (nondynamic) single-structure model, but computes the various energy terms accurately without any special empirical adjustments. Dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) with extended basis sets (triple-$\zeta$ and quadruple-$\zeta$ quality) is used to determine structures and gas-phase interaction energies ($\Delta$E), the COSMO-RS continuum solvation model (based on DFT data) provides solvation free enthalpies and the remaining ro-vibrational enthalpic/entropic contributions are obtained from harmonic frequency calculations. Low-lying vibrational modes are treated by a free-rotor approximation. The accurate account of London dispersion interactions is mandatory with contributions in the range -5 to -60 kcal mol-1 (up to 200 {\%} of $\Delta$E). Inclusion of three-body dispersion effects improves the results considerably. A semilocal (TPSS) and a hybrid density functional (PW6B95) have been tested. Although the $\Delta$Ga values result as a sum of individually large terms with opposite sign ($\Delta$E vs. solvation and entropy change), the approach provides unprecedented accuracy for $\Delta$G a values with errors of only 2 kcal mol-1 on average. Relative affinities for different guests inside the same host are always obtained correctly. The procedure is suggested as a predictive tool in supramolecular chemistry and can be applied routinely to semirigid systems with 300-400 atoms. The various contributions to binding and enthalpy-entropy compensations are discussed. Unprecedented accuracy for computed association free enthalpies of supramolecular host-guest complexes (some examples are shown here) in solution has been achieved by a combination of high-level quantum chemical procedures. The approach is quite general, includes all basic physical effects quantitatively and requires no special empirical adjustments. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

abstract = {The redox properties of two large DNA fragments composed of 39 base pairs, differing only by an 8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) defect replacing a guanine (G), were investigated in physiological conditions using mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations. The quantum region of the native fragment comprised 3 G-C base pairs, while one G was replaced by an 8oxoG in the defect fragment. The calculated values for the redox free energy are 6.55 ± 0.28 eV and 5.62 ± 0.30 eV for the native and the 8oxoG-containing fragment, respectively. The respective estimates for the reorganization free energy are 1.25 ± 0.18 eV and 1.00 ± 0.18 eV. Both reactions follow the Marcus theory for electron transfer. The large difference in redox potential between the two fragments shows that replacement of a G by an 8oxoG renders the DNA more easily oxidizable. This finding is in agreement with the suggestion that DNA fragments containing an 8oxoG defect can act as sinks of oxidative damage that protect the rest of the genome from assault. In addition, the difference in redox potential between the native and the defect DNA fragment indicates that a charge transfer-based mechanism for the recognition of DNA defects might be feasible, in line with recent suggestions based on experimental observations.},

abstract = {We derive a finite-basis-set correction for quasiparticle (QP) energies in the GW approximation and many-body correlation energies in the random phase approximation. Since the correction requires only knowledge of the ground-state density distribution, it is straightforward to implement in any plane-wave code and significantly improves convergence at negligible computational cost. The expression also indicates that QP energies might converge to the wrong value using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method since the overlap densities of occupied orbitals and high-energy, plane-wave-like orbitals are inaccurately described. The error is shown to be related to the incompleteness of the partial waves inside the atomic spheres. It can be avoided by adopting norm-conserving partial waves. G0W0 and GW0 results based on such norm-conserving PAW potentials are presented for a large set of semiconductors and insulators. Accurate extrapolation procedures to the infinite-basis-set limit and infinite-k-point limit are discussed in detail. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Methylene blue [3,7-Bis(di-methylamino) phenothiazin-5-ium chloride] is a phenothiazine dye with applications as a sensitizer for photodynamic therapy, photoantimicrobials, and dye-sensitized solar cells. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), based on (semi)local and global hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, fails to correctly describe its spectral features due to known limitations for describing optical excitations of $\pi$-conjugated systems. Here, we use TDDFT with a non-empirical optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functional to explore the optical excitations of gas phase and solvated methylene blue. We compute solvated configurations using molecular dynamics and an iterative procedure to account for explicit solute polarization. We rationalize and validate that by extrapolating the optimized range separation parameter to an infinite amount of solvating molecules, the optical gap of methylene blue is well described. Moreover, this method allows us to resolve contributions from solvent-solute intermolecular interactions and dielectric screening. We validate our results by comparing them to first-principles calculations based on the GW+Bethe-Salpeter equation approach and experiment. Vibronic calculations using TDDFT and the generating function method account for the spectra's subbands and bring the computed transition energies to within 0.15 eV of the experimental data. This methodology is expected to perform equivalently well for describing solvated spectra of $\pi$-conjugated systems.},

@article{Ceron2007,
abstract = {We introduce orbital specific virtuals (OSVs) to represent the truncated pair-specific virtual space in periodic local M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order (LMP2). The OSVs are constructed by diagonalization of the LMP2 amplitude matrices which correspond to diagonal Wannier-function (WF) pairs. Only a subset of these OSVs is adopted for the subsequent OSV-LMP2 calculation, namely, those with largest contribution to the diagonal pair correlation energy and with the accumu- lated value of these contributions reaching a certain accuracy. The virtual space for a general (non diagonal) pair is spanned by the union of the two OSV sets related to the individual WFs of the pair. In the periodic LMP2 method, the diagonal LMP2 amplitude matrices needed for the construction of the OSVs are calculated in the basis of projected atomic orbitals (PAOs), employing very large PAO domains. It turns out that the OSVs are excellent to describe short range correlation, yet less appropriate for long range van der Waals correlation. In order to compensate for this bias towards short range correlation, we augment the virtual space spanned by the OSVs by the most diffuse PAOs of the corresponding minimal PAO domain. The Fock and overlap matrices in OSV basis are constructed in the reciprocal space. The 4-index electron repulsion integrals are calculated by local density fitting and, for distant pairs, via multipole approximation. New procedures for determining the fit-domains and the distant-pair lists, leading to higher efficiency in the 4-index integral evaluation, have been implemented. Generally, and in contrast to our previous PAO based periodic LMP2 method, the OSV-LMP2 method does not require anymore great care in the specification of the individual domains (to get a balanced description when calculating energy differences) and is in that sense a black box procedure. Discontinuities in potential energy surfaces, which may occur for PAO-based calculations if one is not careful, virtually disappear for OSV-LMP2. Moreover, due to much increased compactness of the pair-specific virtual spaces, the OSV-LMP2 calculations are faster and require much less memory than PAO-LMP2 calculations, despite the noticeable overhead of the initial OSV construction procedure.},

The frequency dependence of the screened Coulomb interaction is explicitly taken into account. In order to avoid the singularities of the screened Coulomb interaction the calculations are performed along the imaginary axis, and the results are analytically continued to the real axis through Pad{\'{e}} approximants. As a proof of concept we implemented the proposed methodology within the empirical pseudopotential formalism and we validated our implementation using silicon as a test case.

A Pad{\'{e}} approximant technique is used to accurately interpolate the recent Monte Carlo results (para and ferro) of Ceperley and Alder into the important range of densities for atoms, molecules, and metals. These results can be combined with the RPA spin-dependence so as to produce a correlation energy for a spin-polarized homogeneous electron gas with an estimated maximum error of 1 mRy and thus should reliably determine the magnitude of non-local corrections to the local spin density approximation in real systems.},

A particular focus is on highly popular methods and the important fact that popularity does not imply accuracy. In this context, we present a new analysis of the openly available data published in Swart and co-workers' famous annual ‘DFT poll' (http://www.marcelswart.eu/dft-poll/) to demonstrate the existing communication gap between the DFT user and developer communities. We show that despite considerable methodological advances in the field, the perception of some parts of the user community regarding their favourite approaches has changed little.

Here we propose a method to mitigate this issue that relies on two steps: (i) the definition of a reduced virtual orbital subspace, thanks to a much smaller basis set; (ii) the account of the remainder through the simpler one-ring approximation to the self-energy. We assess the quality of the corrected quasiparticle energies for simple molecules, and finally we show an application to large graphene chunks to demonstrate the numerical efficiency of the scheme.},

abstract = {Using a second-order approximation to Random Phase Approximation renormalized (RPAr) many-body perturbation theory for the interacting density-density response function, we have developed a so-called higher-order terms (HOT) approximation for the correlation energy. In combination with the first-order RPAr correction, our new method faithfully captures the infinite-order correlation for a given exchange-correlation kernel, yielding errors of the total correlation energy on the order of 1{\%} or less for most systems. For exchange-like kernels, our new method has the further benefit that the coupling-strength integration can be completely eliminated resulting in a modest reduction in computational cost compared to the traditional approach. When the correlation energy is accurately reproduced by the HOT approximation, structural properties and energy differences are also accurately reproduced, as we demonstrate for several periodic solids and some molecular systems. Energy differences involving fragmentation are challenging for the HOT method, however, due to errors that may not cancel between a composite system and its constituent pieces.},

abstract = {Accurate electronic barrier heights are obtained for a set of nine proton-transfer tautomerization reactions, which are either (i) uncatalyzed, (ii) catalyzed by one water molecule, or (iii) catalyzed by two water molecules. The barrier heights for reactions (i) and (ii) are obtained by means of the high-level ab initio W2.2 thermochemical protocol, while those for reaction (iii) are obtained using the W1 protocol. These three sets of benchmark barrier heights allow an assessment of the performance of more approximate theoretical procedures for the calculation of barrier heights of uncatalyzed and water-catalyzed reactions. We evaluate initially the performance of the composite G4 procedure and variants thereof (e.g., G4(MP2) and G4(MP2)-6X), as well as that of standard ab initio procedures (e.g., MP2, SCS-MP2, and MP4). We find that the performance of the G4(MP2)-type thermochemical procedures deteriorates with the number of water molecules involved in the catalysis. This behavior is linked to deficiencies in the MP2-based basis-set-correction term in the G4(MP2)-type procedures. This is remedied in the MP4-based G4 procedure, which shows good performance for both the uncatalyzed and the water-catalyzed reactions, with mean absolute deviations (MADs) from the benchmark values lying below the threshold of "chemical accuracy" (arbitrarily defined as 1 kcal mol -1 ≈ 4.2 kJ mol -1). We also examine the performance of a large number of density functional theory (DFT) and double-hybrid DFT (DHDFT) procedures. We find that, with few exceptions (most notably PW6-B95 and B97-2), the performance of the DFT procedures that give good results for the uncatalyzed reactions deteriorates with the number of water molecules involved in the catalysis. The DHDFT procedures, on the other hand, show excellent performance for both the uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions. Specifically, almost all of them afford MADs below the "chemical accuracy" threshold, with ROB2-PLYP and B2K-PLYP showing the best overall performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The performance of modern density functionals for the prediction of molecular hyperfine couplings is investigated for a series of small radicals and transition metal complexes. Besides the established BP86 (GGA) and B3LYP (hybrid) functionals we have tested two prototypical members of emerging classes of density functionals, namely the TPSS meta-GGA functional (together with its hybrid version TPSSh) and the B2PLYP double-hybrid functional. The latter is the first member of a 'fifth-rung' density functional that incorporates a fraction of orbital dependent nonlocal correlation energy estimated at the level of second-order many-body perturbation theory. Since this approach is non-variational, it becomes necessary to derive and implement the so-called 'relaxed' densities in order to properly predict hyperfine couplings. The necessary formalism is described in some detail and the new method has been implemented into the ORCA electronic structure program. The results of extended test calculations reveal that TPSS is superior to BP86. The hybrid variant TPSSh is at least as accurate or better than the B3LYP functional and significantly superior to the non-hybrid TPSS variant. The B2PLYP functional also leads to accurate predictions and is a clear improvement for the difficult metal nucleus HFCs. However, it also showed a few significant outliers in the test set which points to a somewhat reduced stability in the method. The latter effect is largely attributed to the elevated fraction Hartree-Fock exchange (53{\%}) and to some extent also to the perturbative correction.},

abstract = {In spite of the high quality of exchange-correlation energies Exc obtained with the generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) of density functional theory, their xc potentials vxc are strongly deficient, yielding upshifts of ca. 5 eV in the orbital energy spectrum (in the order of 50{\%} of high-lying valence orbital energies). The GGAs share this deficiency with the local density approximation (LDA). We argue that this error is not caused by the incorrect long-range asymptotics of vxc or by self-interaction error. It arises from incorrect density dependencies of LDA and GGA exchange functionals leading to incorrect (too repulsive) functional derivatives (i.e., response parts of the potentials). The vxc potential is partitioned into the potential of the xc hole vxchole (twice the xc energy density ϵxc), which determines Exc, and the response potential vresp, which does not contribute to Exc explicitly. The substantial upshift of LDA/GGA orbital energies is due to a too repulsive LDA exchange response potential v xresp L D A in the bulk region. Retaining the LDA exchange hole potential plus the B88 gradient correction to it but replacing the response parts of these potentials by the model orbital-dependent response potential v xresp G L L B of Gritsenko et al. [Phys. Rev. A 51, 1944 (1995)], which has the proper step-wise form, improves the orbital energies by more than an order of magnitude.

abstract = {We fully develop the Monte Carlo many-body Green's function (MC-GF) method with the following enhancements: (1) The truncation order of the perturbation expansion of the Dyson self-energy is raised from the second order (MC-GF2) to the third order (MC-GF3) with the aid of a computerized procedure to enumerate and transform all 84 third-order Goldstone diagrams into Monte Carlo integrable expressions and then into central processing unit (CPU)/graphical processing unit (GPU)-parallel computer codes. (2) An efficient algorithm is proposed that computes all off-diagonal and diagonal elements of the MC-GF2 and MC-GF3 self-energy matrices by common subexpression elimination. (3) The frequency-independent approximation is lifted by introducing a method that computes frequency derivatives of the MC-GF2 and MC-GF3 self-energies up to any arbitrarily high order at nearly no additional computational cost. (4) The imaginary-time integration in the Laplace-transformed expressions of the self-energy is carried out stochastically (instead of using a quadrature in the previous implementations), resulting in a 50- to 200-fold speedup. (5) The efficiency of the redundant-walker convergence acceleration scheme is analyzed numerically, and the guidelines are established to select an optimal number of walkers for maximal efficiency. When such an optimal number is used, the cost per sample is constant of molecular size on either many CPUs or many GPUs. (6) The computational cost to obtain a binding energy within a given statistical uncertainty is observed to increase as (tentatively) O(n4) and O(n5) of molecular size (n is the number of electrons) with and without the diagonal approximation, respectively, as opposed to O(n5) and O(n6) of the corresponding deterministic algorithms. With this method applied to the electron binding energies of C60, we show that the third-order corrections to the self-energies are much greater in electron binding energies than in ground-state energies. They display a sign of oscillatory convergence toward experimental results, not necessarily improving the agreement with increasing perturbation order, justifying MC-GF3 and motivating even higher-order methods.},

The interacting bandgap energy is defined as Eg=ERPA(N+1) +ERPA(N-1) -2ERPA(N), where ERPA(N) is the total DFT-RPA energy of the N-electron system. We compare the interacting bandgap energy with the Kohn-Sham bandgap energy, which is the difference between the conduction and valence band edges in the Kohn-Sham band structure. We show that they differ by an unrenormalized "G0W 0" self-energy correction (i.e., a GW self-energy correction computed using Kohn-Sham orbitals and energies as input). This provides a well-defined and meaningful interpretation to G0W0 quasiparticle bandgap calculations, but questions the physics behind the renormalization factors in the expression of the bandgap energy. We also separate the kinetic from the Coulomb contributions to the DFT-RPA bandgap energy, and discuss the related problem of the derivative discontinuity in the DFT-RPA functional.

Here we demonstrate how these undesirable properties of the LWF can lead to a failure of computational methods based on an approximation of the LWF. We apply the nested cluster scheme (NCS) to the Hubbard model and observe the existence of an additional stationary point of the self-consistent equations, associated with an unphysical branch of the LWF. In the strongly correlated regime, starting with the first divergence of $\Gamma$, this unphysical stationary point becomes attractive in the standard iterative technique used to solve DMFT. This leads to an incorrect solution, even in the large cluster size limit, for which we discuss diagnostics.},

abstract = {Exciton charge separation in photosynthetic reaction centers from purple bacteria (PbRC) and photosystem II (PSII) occurs exclusively along one of the two pseudo-symmetric branches (active branch) of pigment-protein complexes. The microscopic origin of unidirectional charge separation in photosynthesis remains controversial. Here we elucidate the essential factors leading to unidirectional charge separation in PbRC and PSII, using nonadiabatic quantum dynamics calculations in conjunction with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics/polarizable continuum model (QM/MM/PCM) method. This approach accounts for energetics, electronic coupling, and vibronic coupling of the pigment excited states under electrostatic interactions and polarization of whole protein environments. The calculated time constants of charge separation along the active branches of PbRC and PSII are similar to those observed in time-resolved spectroscopic experiments. In PbRC, Tyr-M210 near the accessary bacteriochlorophyll reduces the energy of the intermediate state and drastically accelerates charge separation overcoming the electron-hole interaction. Remarkably, even though both the active and inactive branches in PSII can accept excitons from light-harvesting complexes, charge separation in the inactive branch is prevented by a weak electronic coupling due to symmetry-breaking of the chlorophyll configurations. The exciton in the inactive branch in PSII can be transferred to the active branchviadirect and indirect pathways. Subsequently, the ultrafast electron transfer to pheophytin in the active branch prevents exciton back transfer to the inactive branch, thereby achieving unidirectional charge separation.},

abstract = {Excitation energies of closed-shell systems based on the equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster theory at the singles and doubles (CCSD) level with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) included in the post-Hartree-Fock treatment are implemented in the present work. SOC can be included in both the CC and EOM steps (EOM-SOC-CCSD) or only in the EOM part (SOC-EOM-CCSD). The latter approach is an economical way to account for SOC effects, but excitation energies with this approach are not size-intensive. When the unlinked term in the latter approach is neglected (cSOC-EOM-CCSD), size-intensive excitation energies can be obtained. Time-reversal symmetry and spatial symmetry are exploited to reduce the computational effort. Imposing time-reversal symmetry results in a real matrix representation for the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, which facilitates the requirement of time-reversal symmetry for new trial vectors in Davidson's algorithm. Results on some closed-shell atoms and molecules containing heavy elements show that EOM-SOC-CCSD can provide excitation energies and spin-orbit splittings with reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, the SOC-EOM-CCSD approach is able to afford accurate estimates of SOC effects for valence electrons of systems containing elements up to the fifth row, while cSOC-EOM-CCSD is less accurate for spin-orbit splittings of transitions involving p1/2 spinors, even for Kr.

For the first time reliable values for the relative energy distribution among the 1812 isomers (maximum value of 549.1 kcal mol-1, average value of 189.8 ± 46.8 kcal mol-1, 1267 isomers in an energy window of 150-250 kcal mol-1) are given. The quality of the DFT energies is verified by comparison with highly accurate DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS∗ results for ten selected C60 isomers, and the DFT results are further used to benchmark several semiempirical methods. Our findings yield methodological insight into future multi-level modelling of larger carbon nano-structures. We correlate the best relative energies of the isomers to a number of topological indices, electronic properties, and geometrical measures in order to rationalize the isomeric stability aside from the common isolated pentagon rule minimizing the number of pentagon fusions. The information from the best qualitative measures can be condensed to the statement, that a small pentagon signature P1, a large volume, and a more spherical cage lead to a relatively stable isomer. In addition, the best semiempirical method was applied to all 31924 isomers of C80.},

abstract = {G0W0 calculations for predicting vertical ionization potentials (IPs) and electron affinities of molecules and clusters are known to show a significant dependence on the density functional theory (DFT) starting point. A number of nonempirical procedures to find an optimal starting point have been proposed, typically based on tuning the amount of HF exchange in the underlying hybrid functional specifically for the system at hand. For the case of $\pi$-conjugated molecular chains, these approaches lead to a significantly different amount of HF exchange for different oligomer sizes. In this study, we analyze if and how strongly this size dependence affects the ability of nonempirical tuning approaches to predict accurate IPs for $\pi$-conjugated molecular chains of increasing chain length. To this end, we employ three different nonempirical tuning procedures for the G0W0 starting point to calculate the IP of polyene oligomers up to 22 repeat units and compare the results to highly accurate coupled-cluster calculations. We find that, despite its size dependence, using an IP-tuned hybrid functional as a starting point for G0W0 yields excellent agreement with the reference data for all chain lengths.},

abstract = {It is shown that the convergence of the configuration expansion of a many‐electron wavefunction may be drastically improved without significantly complicating the energy matrix elements by using partially non‐orthogonal orbitals. The wavefunction thus obtained is the many‐electron analog to the natural orbital expansion of a two‐electron wavefunction. The orbitals involved may be approximated by pseudonatural orbitals (``PNO–CI{\&}apos;{\&}apos;), and an efficient way of calculating these orbitals is presented. An approximate treatment of multiple substitutions is discussed yielding a coupled electron pair theory formulated within the CI scheme. These methods are applied to the ground state and three ionized states of methane. Including only double substitutions, the computed upper bound to the energy of the ground state is −40.4584 hartree, i.e. 0.057 above the experimental nonrelativistic energy. About 83{\%} of the total correlation energy is accounted for variationally, whereas the coupled‐pair approximation yields 89{\%}. The ratio between intraorbital and interorbital valence shell correlation energy is calculated as 1.56 in the case of localized electrons. The equilibrium distance in CH4 is found to be shifted from 2.046 bohr to 2.061 bohr due to correlation, and the harmonic frequency $\nu$1 is reduced from 3149 cm−1 to 3037 cm−1. These results indicate that the anharmonicity corrections to the observed values have probably been over estimated. The correlation contributions to the ionization potentials are analyzed. The theoretical potentials differ from the observed values by 1{\%}–2{\%}. The energy surface of CH 4 + is investigated and is used to discuss the photoelectron spectrum of CH4. Contrary to previous work, the lowest minimum of CH 4 + is found to have C2v symmetry. In all applications the variational results are compared with those of the independent‐pair and coupled‐pair approaches, and it is concluded that the latter represents a definite improvement over the first two.},

Our estimated exciton binding energy of 43 meV indicates that excitons are relatively stable against thermal dissociation at room temperature.

abstract = {Electronic level alignment at the interface between an adsorbed molecular layer and a semiconducting substrate determines the activity and efficiency of many photocatalytic materials. Standard density functional theory (DFT)-based methods have proven unable to provide a quantitative description of this level alignment. This requires a proper treatment of the anisotropic screening, necessitating the use of quasiparticle (QP) techniques. However, the computational complexity of QP algorithms has meant a quantitative description of interfacial levels has remained elusive. We provide a systematic study of a prototypical interface, bare and methanol-covered rutile TiO2(110) surfaces, to determine the type of many-body theory required to obtain an accurate description of the level alignment. This is accomplished via a direct comparison with metastable impact electron spectroscopy (MIES), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and two-photon photoemission (2PP) spectroscopy. We consider GGA DFT, hybrid DFT, and G0W0, scQPGW1, scQPGW0, and scQPGW QP calculations. Our results demonstrate that G0W0, or our recently introduced scQPGW1 approach, are required to obtain the correct alignment of both the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied interfacial molecular levels (HOMO/LUMO).

The aim of this review is to present an overview of the ab initio quantum chemical and time-dependent density functional theory methods that can be used to model spectroscopy and photochemistry in molecular systems. The applicability and limitations of the different methods as well as the main frontiers are discussed. To illustrate the progress achieved by excited-state chemistry in the recent years as well as the main challenges facing computational chemistry, three main applications that reflect the authors' experience are addressed: the UV/Vis spectroscopy of organic molecules, the assignment of absorption and emission bands of organometallic complexes, and finally, the obtainment of non-adiabatic photoinduced pathways mediated by conical intersections. In the latter case, special emphasis is put on the photochemistry of DNA. These applications show that the description of electronically excited states is a rewarding but challenging area of research. Are we there yet? The progress and challenges in the calculation of electronic excited states is reviewed. The state-of-the-art, advantages and disadvantages of methods based on monoconfigurational, multiconfigurational, and density functional theory calculations is discussed in the light of different applications (see picture).

abstract = {We present well-parallelized local implementations of high-spin open-shell coupled cluster methods with single and double excitations (CCSD) using pair natural orbitals (PNOs). The methods are based on the spin-orbital coupled cluster theory using restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) reference functions. Two variants, namely, PNO-UCCSD and PNO-RCCSD are implemented and compared. In PNO-UCCSD, the coupled cluster amplitudes are spin-unrestricted, while in PNO-RCCSD the linear terms are spin-adapted by a spin-projection approach as described in J. Chem. Phys. 1993, 99, 5219-5227. Near linear scaling of the computational cost with the number of correlated electrons is achieved by applying domain and pair approximations. The PNOs are spin-independent and obtained using a semicanonical spin-restricted MP2 approximation with large domains of projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). The pair approximations of our previously described closed-shell PNO-LCCSD method are carefully revised so that they are compatible to the UCCSD theory, and PNO-UCCSD or PNO-RCCSD calculations for closed-shell molecules yield exactly the same results as corresponding spin-free closed-shell PNO-LCCSD calculations. The convergence of the results with respect to the thresholds and options that control the domain and pair approximations is demonstrated. It is found that large domains are required for the single excitations in open-shell calculations in order to obtain converged results. In general, the errors of relative energies caused by the local approximations can be reduced to below 1 kcal mol-1, even for difficult cases. Presently, PNO-RCCSD and PNO-UCCSD calculations for molecules with 100-200 atoms and augmented triple-$\zeta$ basis sets can be carried out in a few hours of elapsed time using ∼100 CPU cores. In addition, the program is also capable of performing distinguishable cluster (PNO-RDCSD and PNO-UDCSC) calculations. The present work is a critical step in developing fully local open-shell PNO-RCCSD(T)-F12 methods.},

The deviation of the computed excitation energy of this BChl system from the experimental data related to the Qy band maximum of this LH1-RC complex is about 0.2 eV.

@article{Cremer2001,
abstract = {The electron correlation effects covered by density functional theory (DFT) can be assessed qualitatively by comparing DFT densities $\rho$(r) with suitable reference densities obtained with wavefunction theory (WFT) methods that cover typical electron correlation effects. The analysis of difference densities $\rho$(DFT)-$\rho$(WFT) reveals that LDA and GGA exchange (X) functionals mimic non-dynamic correlation effects in an unspecified way. It is shown that these long range correlation effects are caused by the self-interaction error (SIE) of standard X functionals. Self-interaction corrected (SIC) DFT exchange gives, similar to exact exchange, for the bonding region a delocalized exchange hole, and does not cover any correlation effects. Hence, the exchange SIE is responsible for the fact that DFT densities often resemble MP4 or MP2 densities. The correlation functional changes X-only DFT densities in a manner observed when higher order coupling effects between lower order N-electron correlation effects are included. Hybrid functionals lead to changes in the density similar to those caused by SIC-DFT, which simply reflects the fact that hybrid functionals have been developed to cover part of the SIE and its long range correlation effects in a balanced manner. In the case of spin-unrestricted DFT (UDFT), non-dynamic electron correlation effects enter the calculation both via the X functional and via the wavefunction, which may cause a double-counting of correlation effects. The use of UDFT in the form of permuted orbital and broken-symmetry DFT (PO-UDFT, BS-UDFT) can lead to reasonable descriptions of multireference systems provided certain conditions are fulfilled. More reliable, however, is a combination of DFT and WFT methods, which makes the routine description of multireference systems possible. The development of such methods implies a separation of dynamic and non-dynamic correlation effects. Strategies for accomplishing this goal are discussed in general and tested in practice for CAS (complete active space)-DFT.},

The GW approximation provides a parameter-free description of screened exchange but is usually employed perturbatively (G0W0), making results more or less dependent on the starting point. In this work, we develop a quasi-self-consistent extension of G0W0 based on the random phase approximation (RPA) and the optimized effective potential of hybrid density functional theory. This approach generates an optimal G0W0 starting point and a hybrid exchange parameter consistent with the RPA. While self-consistency plays a minor role for systems such as Ar, BN, and ScN, it is shown to be crucial for TiS2 and TiSe2. We find the high-temperature phase of TiSe2 to be a semimetal with a band structure in good agreement with experiment. Furthermore, the optimized hybrid functional agrees well with our previous estimate and therefore accurately reproduces the low-temperature charge-density-wave phase.},

Our methods are applicable to the dielectric matrix formalism of RPA including second-order screened exchange (RPA-SOSEX), the RPA electron-hole time-dependent Hartree-Fock (RPA-eh-TDHF) approximation, and RPA renormalized perturbation theory using an approximate exchange kernel (RPA-AXK). We give an application of our methodology by presenting RPA-SOSEX benchmark results for the L7 test set of large, dispersion dominated molecules, yielding a mean absolute error below 1 kcal/mol.

In particular, we show that the solution obtained with partially self-consistent GW schemes depends on the algorithm one uses to self-consistently solve the quasiparticle (QP) equation. The main observation of the present study is that each branch of the self-energy is associated with a distinct QP solution and that each switch between solutions implies a significant discontinuity in the quasiparticle energy as a function of the internuclear distance. Moreover, we clearly observe "ripple" effects, i.e., when a discontinuity in one of the QP energies induces (smaller) discontinuities in the other QP energies. Going from one branch to another implies a transfer of weight between two solutions of the QP equation. The cases of occupied, virtual, and frontier orbitals are separately discussed on distinct diatomics. In particular, we show that multisolution behavior in frontier orbitals is more likely if the HOMO-LUMO gap is small.},

In contrast, the more popular B3LYP and PBEh functionals fail to describe the interactions in the dispersion-dominated complexes. The local spin density approximation and BHandH functionals give good performance for dispersion-dominated interactions at the expense of a large error for hydrogen bonding.

abstract = {A well-parallelized local singles and doubles coupled-cluster (LCCSD) method using pair natural virtual orbitals (PNOs) is presented. The PNOs are constructed using large domains of projected atomic orbitals (PAOs) and orbital specific virtual orbitals (OSVs). We introduce a hierarchy of close, weak, and distant pairs, based on pair energies evaluated by local M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (LMP2). In contrast to most previous implementations of LCCSD methods, the close and weak pairs are not approximated by LMP2 but treated by higher-order methods. This leads to greatly improved accuracy for large systems, in particular when long-range dispersion interactions are important. Close pair amplitudes are optimized using approximate LCCSD equations, in which slowly decaying terms that mutually cancel at long-range are neglected. For weak pairs, the same approximations are used, but in addition, the nonlinear terms are neglected (coupled electron pair approximation). Distant pairs are treated by spin-component scaled (SCS)-LMP2 using multipole approximations. For efficiency reasons, various projection approximations are also introduced. The impact of these approximations on absolute and relative energies depends on the PNO domain sizes. The errors are found to be negligible, provided that sufficiently large PNO domains are used for close and weak pairs. For the selection of these domains the usual natural orbital occupation number criterion is found to be insufficient, and an additional energy criterion is used. For extended one-dimensional systems, the computational effort of the method scales nearly linearly with the number of correlated electrons, but the linear scaling regime is usually not reached in real-life applications for three-dimensional systems. Nevertheless, due to the parallelization that is efficient up to about 100-200 CPU cores (dependent on the molecular size), accurate calculations for three-dimensional molecules with about 100 atoms and augmented triple-$\zeta$ basis sets (e.g., cc-pVTZ-F12) can be carried out in 1-3 h of elapsed time (depending on the molecular structure and the number of CPU cores, excluding the time for Hartree-Fock). The convergence of the results with respect to the thresholds and options that control the domain, pair, and projection approximations is extensively tested. Benchmark examples for several difficult and large cases are presented, which demonstrate that the errors of relative energies (e.g., reaction energies, barrier heights) caused by the pair and projection approximations can be reduced to below 1 kJ mol-1. The remaining errors are mainly caused by the finite PAO domains. The larger these are made, the more intramolecular or intermolecular basis set superposition errors are introduced, and the canonical results are approached only very slowly. This problem is eliminated in the explicitly correlated variant of our method (PNO-LCCSD-F12), which will be described in a separate paper, along with a larger set of benchmark calculations.},

This reduced the formal scaling of the SOS-MP2 energy calculation to cubic with respect to system size. The computational bottleneck then becomes the THC metric matrix inversion, which scales cubically with a large prefactor. In this work, the local THC approximation is proposed to reduce the computational cost of inverting the THC metric matrix to linear scaling with respect to molecular size. By doing so, we have removed the primary bottleneck to THC-SOS-MP2 calculations on large molecules with O(1000) atoms.

Two different situations are studied: excitations on isolated chains and excitations on chains in crystalline polythiophene. The dielectric tensor for the crystalline situation is obtained by modeling the polymer chains as polarizable line objects, with a long-wavelength polarizability tensor obtained from the ab initio polarizability function of the isolated chain. With this model dielectric tensor we construct a screened interaction for the crystalline case, including both intra- and interchain screening. In the crystalline situation both the quasiparticle band gap and the exciton binding energies are drastically reduced in comparison with the isolated chain. However, the optical gap is hardly affected. We expect this result to be relevant for conjugated polymers in general. {\textcopyright} 2000 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Charged excitations of the oligoacene family of molecules, relevant for astrophysics and technological applications, are widely studied and therefore provide an excellent system for benchmarking theoretical methods. In this work, we evaluate the performance of many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation relative to new high-quality CCSD(T) reference data for charged excitations of the acenes. We compare GW calculations with a number of hybrid density functional theory starting points and with eigenvalue self-consistency. Special focus is given to elucidating the trend of GW-predicted excitations with molecule length increasing from benzene to hexacene. We find that GW calculations with starting points based on an optimally tuned range-separated hybrid (OTRSH) density functional and eigenvalue self-consistency can yield quantitative ionization potentials for the acenes. However, for larger acenes, the predicted electron affinities can deviate considerably from reference values. Our work paves the way for predictive and cost-effective GW calculations of charged excitations of molecules and identifies certain limitations of current GW methods used in practice for larger molecules.},

abstract = {It is chemically intuitive that an optimal atom centered basis set must adapt to its atomic environment, for example by polarizing towards nearby atoms. Adaptive basis sets of small size can be significantly more accurate than traditional atom centered basis sets of the same size. The small size and well conditioned nature of these basis sets leads to large saving in computational cost, in particular in a linear scaling framework. Here, it is shown that machine learning can be used to predict such adaptive basis sets using local geometrical information only. As a result, various properties of standard DFT calculations can be easily obtained at much lower costs, including nuclear gradients. In our approach, a rotationally invariant parameterization of the basis is obtained by employing a potential anchored on neighboring atoms to ultimately construct a rotation matrix that turns a traditional atom centered basis set in a suitable adaptive basis set. The method is demonstrated using MD simulations of liquid...},

abstract = {The objective of this work is the further systematic improvement of the accuracy of Double-Hybrid Density Functionals (DHDF) that add non-local electron correlation effects to a standard hybrid functional by second-order perturbation theory (S. Grimme, J. Chem. Phys., 2006, 124, 034108). The only known shortcoming of these generally highly accurate functionals is an underestimation of the long-range dispersion (van der Waals) interactions. To correct this deficiency, we add a previously developed empirical dispersion term (DFT-D) to the energy expression but leave the electronic part of the functional untouched. Results are presented for the S22 set of non-covalent interaction energies, the G3/99 set of heat of formations and conformational energies of a phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine peptide model. We furthermore propose seven hydrocarbon reactions with strong intramolecular dispersion contributions as a benchmark set for newly developed density functionals. In general, the proposed composite approach is for many chemically relevant properties of similar quality as high-level coupled-cluster treatments. A significant increase of the accuracy for non-covalent interactions is obtained and the corrected B2PLYP DHDF provides one of the lowest ever obtained Mean Absolute Deviations (MAD) for the S22 set (0.2-0.3 kcal mol(-1)). Unprecedented high accuracy is also obtained for the relative energies of peptide conformations that turn out to be very difficult. The significant improvements found for the G3/99 set (reduction of the MAD from 2.4 to 1.7 kcal mol(-1)) underline the importance of intramolecular dispersion effects in large molecules. In all tested cases the results from the standard B3LYP approach are also significantly improved, and we recommend the general use of dispersion corrections in DFT treatments.},

abstract = {The self-assembly of chiral supramolecular polymers is an intricate process that spans a wide range of length scales. Circular dichroism techniques are ideal to study this process as they provide information on the molecular scale but are at the same time also sensitive probes of the long-range interactions that control the growth and morphology of these polymers. As yet, Electronic Circular Dichroism that uses electronic transitions as a probe has by far been the method of choice while Vibrational Circular Dichroism, which uses vibrational transitions to probe structure, is much less employed. Here, we report experimental and theoretical studies of the self-assembly of helical supramolecular polymers of (S)-triarylamine tris-amides ((S)-TATA) in which both techniques are applied in concert. Theoretical studies based on quantum chemical calculations and on simplified models that allow for extrapolation to "infinitely" long polymers provide a solid basis for interpreting results from each of the two techniques that on their own would appear to be contradictory. In the particular case of (S)-TATA it is shown that upon equilibration the initially formed fibers undergo a conformational transition that becomes only "visible" by the combination of the two techniques. Our studies thus show that combining electronic and vibrational domains offers a unique and complementary means to probe these polymers, precisely because they are sensitive to different aspects of molecular and polymeric structure.},

While the latter two methods lead to good agreement with experimental ionization potentials and electron affinities for methane, ozone, and beryllium oxide molecules, FF-G0W0 results can differ by more than one electron volt from experiment.

abstract = {The explicitly correlated approach is one of the most important breakthroughs in ab initio electronic structure theory, providing arguably the most compact, accurate, and efficient ansatz for describing the correlated motion of electrons. Since Hylleraas first used an explicitly correlated wave function for the He atom in 1929, numerous attempts have been made to tackle the significant challenges involved in constructing practical explicitly correlated methods that are applicable to larger systems. These include identifying suitable mathematical forms of a correlated wave function and an efficient evaluation of many-electron integrals. R12 theory, which employs the resolution of the identity approximation, emerged in 1985, followed by the introduction of novel correlation factors and wave function ans{\"{a}}tze, leading to the establishment of F12 theory in the 2000s. Rapid progress in recent years has significantly extended the application range of explicitly correlated theory, offering the potential of an accurate wave-function treatment of complex systems such as photosystems and semiconductors. This perspective surveys explicitly correlated electronic structure theory, with an emphasis on recent stochastic and deterministic approaches that hold significant promise for applications to large and complex systems including solids.

abstract = {We present an approach to renormalized second-order Green's function perturbation theory (GF2) which avoids all dependency on continuous variables, grids or explicit Green's functions, and is instead formulated entirely in terms of static quantities and wave functions. Correlation effects from MP2 diagrams are iteratively incorporated to modify the underlying spectrum of excitations by coupling the physical system to fictitious auxiliary degrees of freedom, allowing for the single-particle orbitals to delocalize into this additional space. The overall approach is shown to be rigorously {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}[N{\^{}}5]{\$}, after an appropriate compression of this auxiliary space. This is achieved via a novel scheme which ensures that a desired number of moments of the underlying occupied and virtual spectra are conserved in the compression, allowing a rapid and systematically improvable convergence to the limit of the effective dynamical resolution. The approach is found to then allow for the qualitative description of stronger correlation effects, avoiding the divergences of MP2, as well as its orbital-optimized version. On application to the G1 test set, we find that modifications to only up to the third spectral moment of the underlying spectrum from which the double excitations are built is required for accurate energetics, even in strongly correlated regimes. This is beyond simple self-consistent changes to the density matrix of the system, but far from requiring a description of the full dynamics of the frequency-dependent self-energy.},

Two choices for Ĥ(0) are discussed and the importance of a spin-pure Ĥ((0)) is underlined. Like the SCS-MP2 approach, the theory contains two parameters (c(os) and c(ss)) that scale the opposite-spin and the same-spin contributions to the second order perturbation energy. It is shown that these parameters can be determined from theoretical considerations by a Feenberg scaling approach or a fit of the wave functions from the perturbation theory to the exact one from a full configuration interaction calculation. The parameters c(os)=1.15 and c(ss)=0.75 are found to be optimal for a reasonable test set of molecules.

A Cholesky decomposition threshold of 10(-4)E(h) for full molecular CD and its one-center approximation (1C-CD) generally yields errors below 0.03 kcal/mol, whereas 10(-3)E(h) is sufficient to obtain the same level of accuracy or better with the atomic CD (aCD) and atomic compact CD (acCD) auxiliary basis sets.

We calculate the polarizability with equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD), which rigorously includes a large class of diagrammatically defined vertex corrections beyond the random phase approximation (RPA). As is well-known, the frequency-dependent polarizability predicted by EOM-CCSD is quite different and generally more accurate than that predicted by the RPA. We evaluate the effect of these vertex corrections on a test set of 20 atoms and molecules. When using a Hartree-Fock reference, ionization potentials predicted by the GW approximation with the RPA polarizability are typically overestimated with a mean absolute error of 0.3 eV. However, those predicted with a vertex-corrected polarizability are typically underestimated with an increased mean absolute error of 0.5 eV. This result suggests that vertex corrections in the self-energy cannot be neglected, at least for molecules. We also assess the behavior of eigenvalue self-consistency in vertex-corrected GW calculations, finding a further worsening of the predicted ionization potentials.},

In accordance with previous studies, increasing the amount of Hartree−Fock (HF) exchange in unrestricted hybrid DFT procedures leads to an increase in the extent of spin contamination. However, in unrestricted double-hybrid DFT procedures, which include both a proportion of HF exchange and a perturbative correlation contribution (MP2), the opposing behavior of UHF and UMP2 with respect to spin contamination leads to smaller differences between the energies predicted by unrestricted and restricted variants.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)10.1063/1.3173827. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 105-106relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e.g., {\textgreater}100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below {\textless}0.05{\%}, which implies typically 15-20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD ("domain based LPNO-CCSD"). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured {\textgreater}8800 basis functions and {\textgreater}450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

However, these methods have yet to be fully benchmarked for the types of interactions important in biomolecules. M05-2X and M06-2X are claimed to capture “medium-range” electron correlation; however, the “long- range” electron correlation neglected by these functionals can also be important in the binding of noncovalent complexes. Here we test M05-2X and M06-2X for the nucleic acid base pairs in the JSCH-2005 database. Using the CCSD(T) binding energies as a benchmark, the performance of these functionals is compared to that of a nonempirical density functional, PBE, and also to that of PBE plus Grimme's empirical dispersion correction, PBE-D. Due to the impor- tance of “long-range” electron correlation in hydrogen-bonded and interstrand base pairs, PBE-D provides more accurate interaction energies on average for the JSCH-2005 database when compared to M05-2X or M06-2X. M06-2X does, however, perform somewhat better than PBE-D for interac- tions between stacked base pairs.},

The effects of the spin-scaling procedure (i.e., MP2 vs SCS-MP2), the basis set size, and the corrections for basis set superposition error (BSSE) are systematically examined. When using two-point basis set extrapolations for the correlation energy, augmentation of the atomic orbital basis with computationally costly diffuse functions is found to be obsolete. In general, SCS-MP2 also improves results for noncovalent interactions statistically on MP2, and significant outliers are removed. Moreover, it is shown that effects of BSSE and one-particle basis set incompleteness almost cancel each other in the case of triple-zeta sets (SCS-MP2/TZVPP or SCS-MP2/cc-pVTZ without counterpoise correction), which opens a practical route to efficient computations for large systems. We recommend SCS-MP2 as the preferred quantum chemical wave function based method for the noncovalent interactions in large biologically relevant systems when reasonable coupled-cluster with single and double and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)) calculations cannot be performed anymore. A comparison to MP2 and CCSD(T) interaction energies for n-alkane dimers, however, indicates (and this also holds to a lesser extent for hydrogen-bonded systems) limitations of SCS-MP2 when treating chemically "saturated" interactions. The different behavior of second-order perturbation theory for saturated and for stacked pi-systems is discussed.},

Their important new aspect is that the range separation parameter in these functionals is determined individually for each system by iteratively tuning it until a fundamental, non-empirical condition is fulfilled. Such functionals have been demonstrated to be extremely successful in predicting electronic excitations. In this paper, we explore the use of the tuning approach for predicting ground state properties. This sheds light on one of its downsides - the violation of size consistency. By analyzing diatomic molecules, we reveal size consistency errors up to several electron volts and find that binding energies cannot be predicted reliably. Further consequences of the consistent ground-state use of the tuning approach are potential energy surfaces that are qualitatively in error and an incorrect prediction of spin states.

In this work we extend the theory to the density-response function. We write the generic diagram for the density-response spectrum as the sum of "partitions." In a partition the original diagram is evaluated using time-ordered Green's functions on the left half of the diagram, antitime-ordered Green's functions on the right half of the diagram, and lesser or greater Green's function gluing the two halves. As there exists more than one way to cut a diagram in two halves, to every diagram corresponds more than one partition. We recognize that the most convenient diagrammatic objects for constructing a theory of positive spectra are the half-diagrams. Diagrammatic approximations obtained by summing the squares of half-diagrams do indeed correspond to a combination of partitions which, by construction, yield a positive spectrum. We develop the theory using bare Green's functions and subsequently extend it to dressed Green's functions. We further prove a connection between the positivity of the spectral function and the analytic properties of the polarizability. The general theory is illustrated with several examples and then applied to solve the long-standing problem of including vertex corrections without altering the positivity of the spectrum. In fact already the first-order vertex diagram, relevant to the study of gradient expansion, Friedel oscillations, etc., leads to spectra which are negative in certain frequency domain. We find that the simplest approximation to cure this deficiency is given by the sum of the zeroth-order bubble diagram, the first-order vertex diagram, and a partition of the second-order ladder diagram. We evaluate this approximation in the three-dimensional homogeneous electron gas and show the positivity of the spectrum for all frequencies and densities.},

To this aim, we study the bond formation mechanism in a series of diatomic molecules. In all studied electron reorganisation mechanisms, the maximal electron-transfer variation point along the bond formation path occurs when about half electron has been transferred from one atom to another. If the process takes place through a harpoon mechanism, this point of the reaction path coincides with the avoided crossing. The electron sharing indices and one-dimensional plots of the electron localisation function and the Laplacian of the electron density along the molecular axis can be used to monitor the bond formation in diatomics and provide a distinction between the harpoon mechanism and a regular electron reorganisation process.},

abstract = {A thorough energy benchmark study of various density functionals (DFs) is carried out with the new GMTKN30 database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions [Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2010, 6, 107; Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2011, 7, 291]. In total, 47 DFs are investigated: two LDAs, 14 GGAs, three meta-GGAs, 23 hybrids and five double-hybrids. Besides the double-hybrids, also other modern approaches, i.e., the M05 and M06 classes of functionals and range-separated hybrids, are tested. For almost all functionals, the new DFT-D3 correction is applied in order to consistently test the performance also for important noncovalent interactions; the parameters are taken from previous works or determined for the present study. Basis set and quadrature grid issues are also considered. The general aim of the study is to work out which functionals are generally well applicable and robust to describe the energies of molecules. In summary, we recommend on the GGA level the B97-D3 and revPBE-D3 functionals. The best meta-GGA is oTPSS-D3 although meta-GGAs represent in general no clear improvement compared to numerically simpler GGAs. Notably, the widely used B3LYP functional performs worse than the average of all tested hybrids and is also very sensitive to the application of dispersion corrections. We discourage its usage as a standard method without closer inspection of the results, as it still seems to be often done nowadays. Surprisingly, long-range corrected exchange functionals do in general not perform better than the corresponding standard hybrids. However, the $\omega$B97X-D functional seems to be a promising method. The most robust hybrid is Zhao and Truhlar's PW6B95 functional in combination with DFT-D3. If higher accuracy is required, double-hybrids should be applied. The corresponding DSD-BLYP-D3 and PWPB95-D3 variants are the most accurate and robust functionals of the entire study. Additional calculations with MP2 and and its spin-scaled variants SCS-MP2, S2-MP2 and SOS-MP2 revealed that double-hybrids in general outperform those. Only SCS-MP2 can be recommended, particularly for reaction energies. We suggest its usage when a large self-interaction error is expected that prohibits usage of double-hybrids. Perdews' metaphoric picture of Jacob's Ladder for the classification of density functionals' performance could unbiasedly be confirmed with GMTKN30. We also show that there is no statistical correlation between a functional's accuracy for atomization energies and the performance for chemically more relevant reaction energies. {\textcopyright} 2011 the Owner Societies.},

For large molecules, the decay properties of integrals and excitation amplitudes becomes evident and our AO method yields a linear scaling algorithm with respect to molecular size.

abstract = {The {\$}GW{\$}-Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) method is promising for calculating the low-lying excited states of molecular systems. So far, it has only been applied to rather small molecules, and in the commonly implemented diagonal approximations to the electronic self-energy it depends on a mean-field starting point. We describe here an implementation of the self-consistent and starting-point independent quasiparticle self-consistent (qs{\$}GW{\$})-BSE approach which is suitable for calculations on large molecules. We herein show that eigenvalue-only self-consistency leads to an unfaithful description of certain excitonic states for Chlorophyll dimers while the qs{\$}GW{\$}-BSE vertical excitation energies (VEE) are in excellent agreement with spectroscopic experiments for Chlorophyll monomers and dimers measured in the gas phase. On the other hand, VEEs from time-dependent density functional theory calculations tend to disagree with experimental values and using different range-separated hybrid (RSH) kernels changes the VEEs by up to 0.5 eV. We use the new qs{\$}GW{\$}-BSE implementation to calculate the lowest excitation energies of the six chromophores of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center (RC) with nearly 2000 correlated electrons. Using more than 11000 (6000) basis functions, the calculation could be completed in less than 5 (2) days one a single modern compute node. In agreement with previous TD-DFT calculations using RSH kernels on models that do also not include environment effects, our qs{\$}GW{\$}-BSE calculations only yield states with local character in the low-energy spectrum of the hexameric complex. Earlier work with RSH kernels has demonstrated that the protein environment facilitates the experimentally observed interchromophoric charge transfer. Therefore, future research will need to combine correlation effects beyond TD-DFT with an explicit treatment of environment electrostatics.},

abstract = {We propose a time-dependent many-body approach to study the short-time dynamics of correlated electrons in quantum transport through nanoscale systems contacted to metallic leads. This approach is based on the time propagation of the Kadanoff-Baym equations for the nonequilibrium many-body Green's function of open and interacting systems out of equilibrium. An important feature of the method is that it takes full account of electronic correlations and embedding effects in the presence of time-dependent external fields, while at the same time satisfying the charge conservation law. The method further extends the Meir-Wingreen formula to the time domain for initially correlated states. We study the electron dynamics of a correlated quantum wire attached to two-dimensional leads exposed to a sudden switch on of a bias voltage using conserving many-body approximations at Hartree-Fock, second Born and GW level. We obtain detailed results for the transient currents, dipole moments, spectral functions, charging times, and the many-body screening of the quantum wire as well as for the time-dependent density pattern in the leads, and we show how the time dependence of these observables provides a wealth of information on the energy level structure of the quantum wire out of equilibrium. For moderate interaction strengths the second Born and GW results are in excellent agreement at all times. We find that many-body effects beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation have a large effect on the qualitative behavior of the system and lead to a bias-dependent gap closing and quasiparticle broadening, shortening of the transient times and washing out of the step features in the current-voltage curves. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

The performance of this functional, for ground-state properties and for vertical excitation energies within time-dependent density functional theory, is systematically evaluated, and optimal values are determined for the range-separation parameter, $\omega$, and for the fraction of short-range Hartree-Fock exchange. We denote the new functional as LRC-$\omega$PBEh, since it reduces to the standard PBEh hybrid functional (also known as PBE0 or PBE1PBE) for a certain choice of its two parameters. Upon optimization of these parameters against a set of ground- and excited-state benchmarks, the LRC-$\omega$PBEh functional fulfills three important requirements: (i) It outperforms the PBEh hybrid functional for ground-state atomization energies and reaction barrier heights; (ii) it yields statistical errors comparable to PBEh for valence excitation energies in both small and medium-sized molecules; and (iii) its performance for charge-transfer excitations is comparable to its performance for valence excitations. LRC-$\omega$PBEh, with the parameters determined herein, is the first density functional that satisfies all three criteria.

Furthermore, the scaling with respect to the number of k points used to sample the Brillouin zone can be reduced to linear order. In combination, this allows accurate and very well-converged single-point RPA calculations, with a time complexity that is roughly on par or better than for self-consistent Hartree-Fock and hybrid-functional calculations. The present implementation enables new applications. Here, we apply the RPA to determine the energy difference between diamond Si and $\beta$-tin Si, the energetics of the Si self-interstitial defect and the Si vacancy, the latter with up to 256 atom supercells. We show that the RPA predicts Si interstitial and vacancy energies in excellent agreement with experiment.

Furthermore, extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit minimizes errors due to the presence of an incomplete basis set and can act as a rigorous test of the limitations of the B3LYP method. Equilibrium geometries, energies, and harmonic vibrational frequencies were determined for a series of well-studied, yet computationally challenging, small inorganics and their respective ions. The results were then extrapolated to the CBS limit, where applicable, and compared to experiment. It was found that a union between the hybrid Hartree-Fock/ density functional B3LYP method and Dunning's augmented correlation-consistent basis sets gave results that were comparable to molecular orbital methods that explicitly account for electron correlation. Furthermore, the minimum basis set necessary to attain reasonable results for the systems studied was aug-cc-pVTZ.

abstract = {For years, there has been ongoing interest in experimentally and theoretically understanding inversion and racemization processes. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no computational study that systematically investigated how well low-level quantum-chemical methods predict inversion barriers. Herein, we provide an answer to this question and we present the INV24 benchmark set of 24 high-level, ab initio inversion barriers. INV24 covers inversion in triatomics, in pyramidal molecules, in one cyclic system, and in various helical and bowl-shaped compounds. Our results indicate that previously applied DFT approximations combined with small basis sets are not reliable enough and that at least a triple-$\zeta$ basis is needed for meaningful results. Moreover, we show that intramolecular London dispersion influences the barriers by 2 kcal/mol or more and that dispersion corrections should always be applied to DFT results. With our analysis of 34 DFT approximations, we can reproduce the well-known Jacob's Ladder scheme with (meta-)generalized-gradient-approximation methods underestimating barriers and global-hybrid DFT functionals performing better. Range-separated hybrids or Minnesota-type hybrids are not particularly superior to more conventional methods, such as B3LYP-D3. The by far best results are achieved with dispersion-corrected double hybrids, which give results below the chemical accuracy target of 1 kcal/mol. They also outperform wave-function second-order perturbation theory approaches and we recommend using them whenever possible. Given that our systematic study of INV24 is the first of its kind, our findings have the potential to change common practice in this field and they will guide future investigations of inversion processes.},

abstract = {Fully self-consistent GW (sc-GW) methods are now available to evaluate quasiparticle and spectral properties of various molecular and bulk systems. However, such techniques based on the full matrix of G and W are computationally demanding. The routinely used single-shot GW approximation (G0W0) has an undesirable dependency on the choice of initial exchange-correlation functional. In the literature, many so-called self-consistent GW methods are based on diagonal approximation of G and low-ranking approximation of W. It is thus worth checking how good such approximations are in comparison with the full matrix method. In this work, we consider AlAs, AlP, GaP, and ZnS as the prototype systems to perform sc-GW calculations by expressing the full G matrix using a plane-wave basis set. We compared our sc-GW results with the diagonal G and subspace W approximated sc-GW results (sc-GW-diagG and sc-GW-subW methods). In the sc-GW-diagG method, interacting G is expanded in the eigenvectors of noninteracting G such that only diagonal elements are retained, whereas the number of eigenmodes is truncated in sc-GW-subW calculations. A systematic analysis of the results obtained from the above techniques is presented. The differences in the quasiparticle band gap between the approximated and the full matrix sc-GW approaches are mostly less than 1.7{\%}, which validates such widely adopted approximations, and also shows how such low-ranking approximation can be used to include higher-order terms such as the vertex correction.},

@article{VanMeer2014,
abstract = {In recent years, several benchmark studies on the performance of large sets of functionals in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of excitation energies have been performed. The tested functionals do not approximate exact Kohn-Sham orbitals and orbital energies closely. We highlight the advantages of (close to) exact Kohn-Sham orbitals and orbital energies for a simple description, very often as just a single orbital-to-orbital transition, of molecular excitations. Benchmark calculations are performed for the statistical average of orbital potentials (SAOP) functional for the potential [J. Chem. Phys. 2000, 112, 1344; 2001, 114, 652], which approximates the true Kohn-Sham potential much better than LDA, GGA, mGGA, and hybrid potentials do. An accurate Kohn-Sham potential does not only perform satisfactorily for calculated vertical excitation energies of both valence and Rydberg transitions but also exhibits appealing properties of the KS orbitals including occupied orbital energies close to ionization energies, virtual-occupied orbital energy gaps very close to excitation energies, realistic shapes of virtual orbitals, leading to straightforward interpretation of most excitations as single orbital transitions. We stress that such advantages are completely lost in time-dependent Hartree-Fock and partly in hybrid approaches. Many excitations and excitation energies calculated with local density, generalized gradient, and hybrid functionals are spurious. There is, with an accurate KS, or even the LDA or GGA potentials, nothing problematic about the band gap in molecules: the HOMO-LUMO gap is close to the first excitation energy (the optical gap).},

abstract = {The workhorse method of computational materials science is undeniably the density functional theory (DFT) in the Kohn-Sham framework of approximate exchange and correlation energy functionals. However, the need for highly accurate electronic structure theory calculations in materials science motivates the further development and exploration of alternative as well as complementary techniques. Among these alternative approaches, quantum chemical wavefunction based theories and in particular coupled cluster theory hold promise in filling the gap in the toolbox of computational materials scientists. Coupled cluster (CC) theory provides a compelling framework of approximate infinite-order perturbation theory, in the form of an exponential of cluster operators describing the true quantum many-body effects of the electronic wave function at a computational cost that, despite being significantly more expensive than DFT, scales polynomially with system size. The hierarchy of size-extensive approximate methods established in the framework of CC theory, achieves systematic improvability for many materials properties. This is in contrast to currently available density functionals that often suffer from uncontrolled approximations that limit the accuracy in the prediction of materials properties. In this tutorial-style review we will introduce basic concepts of coupled cluster theory and recent developments that increase its computational efficiency for calculations of molecules, solids and materials in general. We will touch upon the connection between coupled cluster theory and the random-phase approximation that is widely used in the field of solid-state physics. We will discuss various approaches to improve the computational performance without compromising on accuracy. These approaches include large-scale parallel design as well as techniques that reduce the pre-factor of the computational complexity. A central part of this article discusses the convergence of calculated properties to the thermodynamic limit, which is of significant importance for reliable predictions of materials properties and constitutes an additional challenge compared to calculations of large molecules. We mention technical aspects of computer code implementations of periodic coupled cluster theories in different numerical frameworks of the one-electron orbital basis; the projector-augmented-wave formalism using a plane wave basis set and the numeric atom-centered-orbital (NAO) with resolution-of-identity. We will discuss results and the possible scope of these implementations and how they can help advance the current state of the art in electronic structure theory calculations of materials.},

In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular , following Percus Q[p] = min (IIT+ Veeifp) is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron-electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density p. QIPJ all antisymmetric wavefunctions I' which yield the fixed p. Q1p] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, W[y] = min ({\P}7 'VeeI') is shown to be the universal functional for the electron-electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix y, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential: Thus, the v-repre-sentability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree-Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory. This paper addresses the problem of generating adequate representations of the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and solids without explicit recourse to many-particle wave-functions. Instead, electron densities and first-order density matrices (one-matrices) are used directly for ground-state variational calculations. Densities and one-matrices are com-putationally attractive because their dimensions are smaller than those of the full wavefunctions. Formal justification for utilizing the three-dimensional electron density directly in variational calculations arises from the important theorems of Hohenberg and Kohn (1). Consider N electrons in a local external potential v. The Hamiltonian is {\~{}} {\~{}} N H.= T + Vee + v i=l [1] where T and Vee are, respectively, the kinetic and electron-electron repulsion operators. Assume that one wishes to solve variationally for the ground-state energy of H.

For dealing with the most general case, we use the Keldysh time-loop contour formalism to evaluate the single-particle Green's functions. We provide the formal extension of Hedin's GW equations for the Green's function in the Keldysh formalism. We show an application of our formalism to the plasmon model of a core electron within the plasmon-pole approximation. We study in detail the effects of the diagrammatic perturbation expansion of the core-electron/plasmon coupling on the spectral functions in the so-called S model. The S model provides an exact solution at equilibrium for comparison with the diagrammatic expansion of the interaction. We show that self-consistency is essential in GW-based calculations to obtain the full spectral information. The second-order exchange diagram (i.e., a vertex correction) is also crucial to obtain the good spectral description of the plasmon satellites. We corroborate these results by considering conventional equilibrium GW-based calculations for the pure jellium model. We find that with no second-order vertex correction, one cannot obtain the full set of plasmon side-band resonances. We also discuss in detail the formal expression of the Dyson equations obtained for the time-ordered Green's function at zero and finite temperature from the Keldysh formalism and from conventional equilibrium many-body perturbation theory. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A linear-scaling implementation of Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham self-consistent field (SCF) theories is presented and illustrated with applications to molecules consisting of more than 1000 atoms. The diagonalization bottleneck of traditional SCF methods is avoided by carrying out a minimization of the Roothaan-Hall (RH) energy function and solving the Newton equations using the preconditioned conjugate-gradient (PCG) method. For rapid PCG convergence, the L{\"{o}}wdin orthogonal atomic orbital basis is used. The resulting linear-scaling trust-region Roothaan-Hall (LS-TRRH) method works by the introduction of a level-shift parameter in the RH Newton equations. A great advantage of the LS-TRRH method is that the optimal level shift can be determined at no extra cost, ensuring fast and robust convergence of both the SCF iterations and the level-shifted Newton equations. For density averaging, the authors use the trust-region density-subspace minimization (TRDSM) method, which, unlike the traditional direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DUS) scheme, is firmly based on the principle of energy minimization. When combined with a linear-scaling evaluation of the Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix (including a boxed fitting of the electron density), LS-TRRH and TRDSM methods constitute the linear-scaling trust-region SCF (LS-TRSCF) method. The LS-TRSCF method compares favorably with the traditional SCF/ DUS scheme, converging smoothly and reliably in cases where the latter method fails. In one case where the LS-TRSCF method converges smoothly to a minimum, the SCF/DIIS method converges to a saddle point. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

Recently, it has been identified that the density matrix that is obtained from the contraction of the GW Green's function allows one to include Feynman diagrams that are significant for the ionization potentials. However, the Green's function contains much more information than the mere quasi-particle energies. Here, we test and assess the quality of this so-called linearized GW density matrix for several molecular properties. First of all, we extend the original formulation to perform the linearization starting from any self-consistent mean-field approximation, and not only from Hartree-Fock. We then demonstrate the reliability and the stability of the linearized GW density matrix to evaluate the total energy out of a non-self-consistent GW calculation. Based on a comprehensive benchmark of 34 molecules, we compare the quality of the electronic density, Hartree energy, exchange energy, and the Fock operator expectation values against other well-established techniques. In particular, we show that the obtained linearized GW densities markedly differ from those calculated within the widespread quasi-particle self-consistent GW approximation.},

However, due to the bad conditioning of the continuation transform from imaginary to real frequencies, established methods tend to either wash out spectral features at high frequencies or produce spectral functions with unphysical negative parts. Here, we show that explicitly respecting the analytic "Nevanlinna"structure of the Green's function leads to intrinsically positive and normalized spectral functions, and we present a continued fraction expansion that yields all possible functions consistent with the analytic structure. Application to synthetic trial data shows that sharp, smooth, and multipeak data is resolved accurately. Application to the band structure of silicon demonstrates that high energy features are resolved precisely. Continuations in a realistic correlated setup reveal additional features that were previously unresolved. By substantially increasing the resolution of real frequency calculations our work overcomes one of the main limitations of finite-temperature quantum simulations.},

abstract = {We derive a renormalized many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) starting from the random phase approximation (RPA). This RPA-renormalized perturbation theory extends the scope of single-reference MBPT methods to small-gap systems without significantly increasing the computational cost. The leading correction to RPA, termed the approximate exchange kernel (AXK), substantially improves upon RPA atomization energies and ionization potentials without affecting other properties such as barrier heights where RPA is already accurate. Thus, AXK is more balanced than second-order screened exchange [A. Gr{\"{u}}neis, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 154115 (2009)], which tends to overcorrect RPA for systems with stronger static correlation. Similarly, AXK avoids the divergence of second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) theory for small gap systems and delivers a much more consistent performance than MP2 across the periodic table at comparable cost. RPA+AXK thus is an accurate, non-empirical, and robust tool to assess and improve semi-local density functional theory for a wide range of systems previously inaccessible to first-principles electronic structure calculations. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The main focus has been on the frequency dependence of the EXX kernel and on how it affects the spectrum as compared to the corresponding adiabatic approximation. We show that for some discrete excitation energies the frequency dependence is essential to reproduce the results of time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. Unfortunately, we have found that the EXX approximation breaks down completely at higher energies, producing a response function with the wrong analytic structure and making inner-shell excitations disappear from the calculated spectra. We have traced this failure to the existence of vanishing eigenvalues of the Kohn-Sham non-interacting response function. Based on the adiabatic TDDFT formalism we propose a new way of deriving the Fano parameters of autoionizing resonances. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A symmetry scheme based on the irreducible corepresentations of the full symmetry group of a molecular system is presented for use in relativistic calculations. Consideration of time-reversal symmetry leads to a reformulation of the Dirac-Hartree-Fock equations in terms of quaternion algebra. Further symmetry reductions due to molecular point group symmetry are then manifested by a descent to complex or real algebra. Spatial symmetry will be restricted to D2h and subgroups, and it will be demonstrated that the Frobenius-Schur test can be used to characterize these groups as a whole. The resulting symmetry scheme automatically provides maximum point group and time-reversal symmetry reduction of the computational effort, also when the Fock matrix is constructed in a scalar basis, that is, from the same type of electron repulsion integrals over symmetry-adapted scalar basis functions as in nonrelativistic theory. An illustrative numerical example is given showing symmetry reductions comparable to the nonrelativistic case. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

The best results are obtained with the method called RSH+RPAx, which yields interaction energies for the S22 set with an estimated mean absolute error of about 0.5-0.6 kcal/mol, corresponding to a mean absolute percentage error of about 7{\%}-9{\%} depending on the reference interaction energies used.

abstract = {The known CEPA variants CEPA (v) with v = 0,1,2,3 and two new ones with v = 4, 5 are compared both formally and for various numerical examples with CP-MET. The main conclusions are: 1. In those situations where both CP-MET and the CEPA variants are justified (i.e. for "good" closed shell states) the correlation energies obtained with the 7 different schemes differ very little (by something like ±2{\%}), with CEPA (1) closest to CP-MET (difference usually a fraction of 1{\%}) and CEPA (4) nearly as close; this is rather insensitive to whether one uses canonical or localized orbitals. Even CEPA (3) is not too far from CP-MET, which confirms an earlier suggestion of Kelly. 2. In those cases where one of the 7 schemes fails (e.g. due to near degeneracy as in covalent molecules at large internuclear distances) the other 6 usually fail as well, though CEPA (0) is then somewhat poorer than the other schemes. Then no longer CEPA (1) but rather CEPA (3) is closest to CP-MET and then all schemes converge much better in a localized representation. 3. CEPA (2) usually leads to best agreement with experiment since it simulates to some extent triple substitutions. In none of the studied examples does CP-MET show a significant superiority as compared to the other schemes. Possible improvements to extend the domain of applicability of these methods are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1981 Springer-Verlag.},

A comparison is made with local-density approximation results. The bands near the gap are fitted to an effective Kohn-Luttinger-type Hamiltonian appropriate for the orthorhombic symmetry, and conduction-band effective masses are presented. Exciton binding energies and zero-point motion corrections to the gaps are estimated. While ZnSiN2 is found to be an indirect gap semiconductor, ZnGeN2 and ZnSnN2 are direct gap semiconductors. The gaps range from the orange-red to deep UV. The valence-band maximum is split in three levels of different symmetry, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and should show transitions to the conduction band, each for a separate polarization. Spin-orbit effects are found to be surprisingly small, indicating almost exact compensation of the N-2p and Zn-3d contributions. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

Computed activation free energies for the cycloadditions of cycloalkynes are 16.5–22.0 kcal mol −1 lower in energy than that of the acyclic 2-butyne. The strained or predistorted nature of cycloalkynes is often solely used to rationalize this significant rate enhancement. Our distortion/interaction–activation strain analysis has been revealed that the degree of geometrical predistortion of the cycloalkyne ground-state geometries acts to enhance reactivity compared with that of acyclic alkynes through three distinct mechanisms, not only due to (i) a reduced strain or distortion energy, but also to (ii) a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap, and (iii) an enhanced orbital overlap, which both contribute to more stabilizing orbital interactions.},

abstract = {In many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) the self-energy $\Sigma$=iGW$\Gamma$ plays a key role since it contains all the many-body effects of the system. The exact self-energy is not known; as a first approximation one can set the vertex function $\Gamma$ to unity which leads to the GW approximation. The latter properly describes the high-density regime, where screening is important; in the low-density regime, instead, other approximations are proposed, such as the T matrix, which describes multiple scattering between two particles. Here we combine the two approaches. Starting from the fundamental equations of MBPT, we show how one can derive the T-matrix approximation to the self-energy in a common framework with GW. This allows us to elucidate several aspects of this formulation, including the origin of, and link between, the electron-hole and the particle-particle T matrix, the derivation of a screened T matrix, and the conversion of the T matrix into a vertex correction. The exactly solvable Hubbard molecule is used for illustration. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The alternative separation of exchange and correlation energies proposed by Toulouse [Theor. Chem. Acc. 114, 305 (2005)] is explored in the context of multi-configuration range-separated density-functional theory. The new decomposition of the short-range exchange-correlation energy relies on the auxiliary long-range interacting wavefunction rather than the Kohn-Sham (KS) determinant. The advantage, relative to the traditional KS decomposition, is that the wavefunction part of the energy is now computed with the regular (fully interacting) Hamiltonian. One potential drawback is that, because of double counting, the wavefunction used to compute the energy cannot be obtained by minimizing the energy expression with respect to the wavefunction parameters. The problem is overcome by using short-range optimized effective potentials (OEPs). The resulting combination of OEP techniques with wavefunction theory has been investigated in this work, at the Hartree-Fock (HF) and multi-configuration self-consistent-field (MCSCF) levels. In the HF case, an analytical expression for the energy gradient has been derived and implemented. Calculations have been performed within the short-range local density approximation on H2, N2, Li2, and H 2O. Significant improvements in binding energies are obtained with the new decomposition of the short-range energy. The importance of optimizing the short-range OEP at the MCSCF level when static correlation becomes significant has also been demonstrated for H2, using a finite-difference gradient. The implementation of the analytical gradient for MCSCF wavefunctions is currently in progress. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

To obtain these energies, we use equation-of-motion/linear-response coupled cluster theory up to the highest technically possible excitation order for these systems (CC3, EOM-CCSDT, and EOM-CCSDTQ) and selected configuration interaction (SCI) calculations (with tens of millions of determinants in the reference space), as well as the multiconfigurational n-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) method. All these approaches are applied in combination with diffuse-containing atomic basis sets. For all transitions, we report at least CC3/aug-cc-pVQZ vertical excitation energies as well as CC3/aug-cc-pVTZ oscillator strengths for each dipole-allowed transition. We show that CC3 almost systematically delivers transition energies in agreement with higher-level methods with a typical deviation of ±0.04 eV, except for transitions with a dominant double excitation character where the error is much larger. The present contribution gathers a large, diverse, and accurate set of more than 200 highly accurate transition energies for states of various natures (valence, Rydberg, singlet, triplet, n → $\pi$*, $\pi$→ $\pi$*,...). We use this series of theoretical best estimates to benchmark a series of popular methods for excited state calculations: CIS(D), ADC(2), CC2, STEOM-CCSD, EOM-CCSD, CCSDR(3), CCSDT-3, CC3, and NEVPT2.

The usual Hamiltonian corresponding to a system of individual electrons with Coulomb interactions is first re-expressed in such a way that the long-range part of the Coulomb interactions between the electrons is described in terms of collective fields, representing organized "plasma" oscillation of the system as a whole. The Hamiltonian then describes these collective fields plus a set of individual electrons which interact with the collective fields and with one another via short-range screened Coulomb interactions. There is, in addition, a set of subsidiary conditions on the system wave function which relate the field and particle variables. The field-particle interaction is eliminated to a high degree of approximation by a further canonical transformation to a new representation in which the Hamiltonian describes independent collective fields, with n′ degrees of freedom, plus the system of electrons interacting via screened Coulomb forces with a range of the order of the inter electronic distance. The new subsidiary conditions act only on the electronic wave functions; they strongly inhibit long wavelength electronic density fluctuations and act to reduce the number of individual electronic degrees of freedom by n′. The general properties of this system are discussed, and the methods and results obtained are related to the classical density fluctuation approach and Tomonaga's one-dimensional treatment of the degenerate Fermi gas. {\textcopyright} 1953 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We present a comparative study of excited states in push-pull oligomers of PCPDTBT and PSBTBT and prototypical complexes with a C60 acceptor using many-body Green's functions theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We analyze excitations in oligomers up to a length of 5 nm and find that for both materials the absorption energy practically saturates for structures larger than two repeat units due to the localized nature of the excitation. In the bimolecular complexes with C60, the transition from Frenkel to charge transfer excitons is generally exothermic and strongly influenced by the acceptor's position and orientation. The high CT binding energy of the order of 2 eV results from the lack of an explicit molecular environment. External polarization effects are then modeled in a GW-BSE based QM/MM approach by embedding the donor-acceptor complex into a polarizable lattice. The lowest charge transfer exciton is energetically stabilized by about 0.5 eV, while its binding energy is reduced to about 0.3 eV. We also identify a globally unbound charge transfer state with a more delocalized hole at higher energy while still within the absorption spectrum, which opens another potential pathway for charge separation. For both PCPDTBT and PSBTBT, the energetics are largely similar with respect to absorption and the driving force to form intermediate charge transfer excitations for free charge generation. These results support that the higher power conversion efficiency observed for solar cells using PSBTBT as donor material is a result of molecular packing rather than of the electronic structure of the polymer. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

To evaluate the performance of this set of new cost-effective methods, denoted as RI-DSD-DFTs, seven validation data sets were designed to cover a broad range of non-covalent interactions with characteristic stabilizing contributions. Inclusion of the perturbative treatment of correlation effects is shown to significantly improve the description of weak interactions. The set of DSD-DFTs provide interaction energies with root-mean-square deviations and mean absolute errors within 0.5 kcal/mol.

abstract = {A Monte Carlo method for evaluating multicenter two-electron-repulsion integrals over any types of orbitals (Slater, Sturmian, finite-range, numerical, etc.) is presented. The approach is based on a simple and universal (orbital-independent) gaussian sampling of the two-electron configuration space and on the use of efficient zero-variance Monte Carlo estimators. Quite remarkably, it is shown that the high level of accuracy required on two-electron integrals to make Hartree-Fock (HF) and configuration interaction (CI) calculations feasible can be achieved. A first zero-variance estimator is built by introducing a gaussian approximation of the orbitals and by evaluating the two-electron integrals using a correlated sampling scheme for the difference between exact and approximate orbitals. A second one is based on the introduction of a general coordinate transformation. The price to pay for this simple and general Monte Carlo scheme is the high computational cost required. However, we argue that the great simplicity of the algorithm, its embarrassingly parallel nature, its ideal adaptation to modern computational platforms and, most importantly, the possibility of using more compact and physically meaningful basis sets nevertheless make the method attractive. HF and near full CI (FCI) calculations using Slater-type orbitals (STOs) are reported for Be, CH4, and [H2N(CH)NH2]+ (a simple model of cyanine). To the best of our knowledge, our largest FCI calculation involving 18 active electrons distributed among 90 orbitals for the cyanine molecule is the most extensive molecular calculation performed so far using pure STOs (no gaussian approximation, even for the challenging four-center two-electron integrals).},

Although formally a dimer theory, we have previously introduced an "extended" version (XSAPT) that incorporates many-body polarization via self-consistent charge embedding. Here, we extend the XSAPT methodology to include nonadditive dispersion, using a modified form of the many-body dispersion (MBD) method of Tkatchenko and co-workers. Dispersion interactions beyond the pairwise atom-atom approximation improve total interaction energies even in small systems, and for large ?-stacked complexes these corrections can amount to several kilocalories per mole. The XSAPT+MBD method introduced here achieves errors of ≤1 kcal/mol (as compared to high-level ab initio benchmarks) for the L7 data set of large dispersion-bound complexes and ≤4 kcal/mol (as compared to experiment) for the S30L data set of host-guest complexes. This is superior to the best contemporary density functional methods for noncovalent interactions, at comparable or lower cost.

abstract = {It is commonly accepted that the GW approximation for the electron self-energy is successful for the description of the band structure of weakly to moderately correlated systems, whereas it will fail for strongly correlated materials. In the present work, we discuss two important aspects of this approximation: first, the "self-screening error," which is due to an incorrect treatment of induced exchange, and second, the atomic limit, in which, instead, correlation is directly responsible for the observed problem. Using the example of the removal of a particle from a box, we show that the self-screening error stems from the use of test charge-test charge screening and that it can be corrected by a two-point vertex contribution to the self-energy derived from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We explain why the addition of a particle, instead, requires the use of a different approximate vertex. This illustrates why the general vertex function, valid both for valence and conduction states, must be a three-point function. Moreover, we show that also the bad performance of GW in the atomic limit is due to the neglect of the vertex in the self-energy; in that case, the TDDFT-derived vertex correction is not sufficient in order to remove the error even qualitatively. We discuss the effects of the self-screening error as well as the atomic limit using GW for the exactly solvable two-site Hubbard model. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

With only one electron, hydrogen contains no electronic correlation and is therefore particularly susceptible to spurious self-interaction errors introduced by certain computational methods. In this paper we focus on many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) in Hedin's GW approximation. While the Hartree-Fock and the exact MBPT self-energy are free of self-interaction, the correlation part of the GW self-energy does not have this property. Here we use atomic hydrogen as a benchmark system for GW and show that the self-interaction part of the GW self-energy, while nonzero, is small.

abstract = {We present a perspective on the use of diffuse basis functions for electronic structure calculations by density functional theory and wave function theory. We especially emphasize minimally augmented basis sets and calendar basis sets. We base our conclusions on our previous experience with commonly computed quantities, such as bond energies, barrier heights, electron affinities, noncovalent (van der Waals and hydrogen bond) interaction energies, and ionization potentials, on Stephens et al.s results for optical rotation and on our own new calculations (presented here) of polarizabilities and of potential energy curves of van der Waals complexes. We emphasize the benefits of partial augmentation of the higher-zeta basis sets in preference to full augmentation at a lower $\delta$ level. Benefits and limitations of the use of fully, partially, and minimally augmented basis sets are reviewed for different electronic structure methods and molecular properties. We have found that minimal augmentation is almost always enough for density functional theory (DFT) when applied to ionization potentials, electron affinities, atomization energies, barrier heights, and hydrogen-bond energies. For electric dipole polarizabilities, we find that augmentation beyond minimal has an average effect of 8{\%} at the polarized triple-$\delta$ level and 5{\%} at the polarized quadruple-$\delta$ level. The effects are larger for potential energy curves of van der Waals complexes. The effects are also larger for wave function theory (WFT). Even for WFT though, full augmentation is not needed for most purposes, and a level of augmentation between minimal and full is optimal for most problems. The calendar basis sets named after the months provide a convergent sequence of partially augmented basis sets that can be used for such calculations. The jun-cc-pV(T+d)Z basis set is very useful for MP2-F12 calculations of barrier heights and hydrogen bond strengths. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

This work allows for increased confidence given the agreement with respect to values recently obtained using the local natural orbital CCSD(T) for L7 and the canonical CCSD(T)/CBS result for the coronene dimer (C2C2PD). Therefore, these results can be considered pushing the CCSD(T)/CBS binding benchmark to the hundred-atom scale. The disagreements between the two state-of-the-art methods, CCSD(T) and fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo, are substantial with at least 2.0 (∼10{\%}), 1.9 (∼5{\%}), and 10.3 kcal/mol (∼25{\%}) differences for C2C2PD in L7, DNA-ellipticine, and buckycatcher-C60, respectively. Such sizable discrepancy above "chemical accuracy"for large noncovalent complexes indicates how challenging it is to obtain benchmark binding interactions for systems beyond small molecules, although the three up-to-date density functionals, PBE0+D4, $\omega$B97M-V, and B97M-V, agree better with CCSD(T) for these large systems. In addition to reporting these values, different basis sets and various CBS extrapolation parameters for Hartree-Fock and MP2 correlation energies were tested for the first time in large noncovalent complexes with the goal of providing some indications toward optimal cost effective routes to approach the CBS limit without substantial loss in quality.},

abstract = {Excitation gaps are of considerable significance in electronic structure theory. Two different gaps are of particular interest. The fundamental gap is defined by charged excitations, as the difference between the first ionization potential and the first electron affinity. The optical gap is defined by a neutral excitation, as the difference between the energies of the lowest dipole-allowed excited state and the ground state. Within many-body perturbation theory, the fundamental gap is the difference between the corresponding lowest quasi-hole and quasi-electron excitation energies, and the optical gap is addressed by including the interaction between a quasi-electron and a quasi-hole. A long-standing challenge has been the attainment of a similar description within density functional theory (DFT), with much debate on whether this is an achievable goal even in principle. Recently, we have constructed and applied a new approach to this problem. Anchored in the rigorous theoretical framework of the generalized Kohn-Sham equation, our method is based on a range-split hybrid functional that uses exact long-range exchange. Its main novel feature is that the range-splitting parameter is not a universal constant but rather is determined from first principles, per system, based on satisfaction of the ionization potential theorem. For finite-sized objects, this DFT approach mimics successfully, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the quasi-particle picture of many-body theory. Specifically, it allows for the extraction of both the fundamental and the optical gap from one underlying functional, based on the HOMO-LUMO gap of a ground-state DFT calculation and the lowest excitation energy of a linear-response time-dependent DFT calculation, respectively. In particular, it produces the correct optical gap for the difficult case of charge-transfer and charge-transfer-like scenarios, where conventional functionals are known to fail. In this perspective, we overview the formal and practical challenges associated with gap calculations, explain our new approach and how it overcomes previous difficulties, and survey its application to a variety of systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The new mechanics of the atom introduced by Heisenberg may be based on the assumption that the variables that describe a dynamical system do not obey the commutative law of multiplication, but satisfy instead certain quantum conditions. One can build up a theory without knowing anything about the dynamical variables except the algebraic laws that they are subject to, and can show that they may be represented by matrices whenever a set of uniformising variables for the dynamical system exists. It may be shown, however (see 3), that there is no set of uniformising variables for a system containing more than one electron, so that the theory cannot progress very far on these lines. A new development of the theory has recently been given by Schr{\"{o}}dinger. Starting from the idea that an atomic system cannot be represented by a trajectory, i. e ., by a point moving through the co-ordinate space, but must be represented by a wave in this space, Schr{\"{o}}dinger obtains from a variation prin­ciple a differential equation which the wave function $\psi$ must satisty. This differential equation turns out to be very closely connected with the Hamiltonian equation which specifies the system, namely, if H ( q r , P r - W = 0 is the Hamiltonian equation of the system, where the q r , P r are canonical variables, then the wave equation for $\psi$ is {\{}H( q r , ih ∂/∂ q ) - W{\}} $\psi$ = 0.},

abstract = {There have been tremendous efforts in the past decade on the use of computational methods for conjugated systems. Their properties and energetics are often described by density functional theory calculations which, however, are known to face a challenge when dealing with these systems since serious and systematic errors with popular density functionals occur, specially in the case of having stacked or sterically overcrowded aromatic systems, and discourage their use as a black box technique. We overcome here this shortcoming by applying recently developed dispersion-corrected double-hybrid density functionals (B2PLYP) in search of greater yet wide accuracy with little more computational effort. Interestingly, we have derived a related method (B2$\pi$ PLYP), which has been thoroughly assessed against a set of databases and reactions of the most interest, and works better for this subclass of systems. The deviations with respect to benchmark or experimental values are found to be in the reasonably low range of 1-2 kcal/mol when a correction for the dispersion interactions is added and, most importantly, without suffering the large and systematic errors that are common in former yet conventional methods. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Spectroscopic techniques are valuable tools for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex systems, such as biomolecules or nanomaterials. Most of the current research is devoted to the development of new experimental techniques for improving the intrinsic resolution of different spectra. However, the subtle interplay of several different effects acting at different length and time scales still makes the interpretation and analysis of such spectra a very difficult task. In this respect, computational spectroscopy is becoming a needful and versatile tool for the assignment and interpretation of experimental spectra. It is in fact possible nowadays to model with relatively high accuracy the physical-chemical properties of complex molecules in different environments, and to link spectroscopic evidence directly to the structural and dynamical properties of optically or magnetically active solvated probes. In this Review, significant steps toward the simulation of entire spectra in condensed phases are presented together with some basic aspects of computational spectroscopy, which highlight how intramolecular and intermolecular degrees of freedom influence several spectroscopic parameters. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH{\&} Co.

Despite the massive momentum of experimental research in this direction, a predictive quantum-mechanical framework for describing electron-plasmon interactions in real materials is still missing. Here, starting from a many-body Green's function approach, we develop an ab initio approach for investigating electron-plasmon coupling in solids. As a first demonstration of this methodology, we show that electron-plasmon scattering is the primary mechanism for the cooling of hot carriers in doped silicon, it is key to explaining measured electron mobilities at high doping, and it leads to a quantum zero-point renormalization of the band gap in agreement with experiment.},

Its popularity stems from its beautifully simple conceptual framework and computational elegance. The rise of KS-DFT in chemical physics began in earnest in the mid 1980s, when crucial developments in its exchange-correlation term gave the theory predictive power competitive with well-developed wave-function methods. Today KS-DFT finds itself under increasing pressure to deliver higher and higher accuracy and to adapt to ever more challenging problems. If we are not mindful, however, these pressures may submerge the theory in the wave-function sea. KS-DFT might be lost. I am hopeful the Kohn-Sham philosophical, theoretical, and computational framework can be preserved. This Perspective outlines the history, basic concepts, and present status of KS-DFT in chemical physics, and offers suggestions for its future development.},

Here the index ‘ n Z' refers to the number of basis functions used for the valence shell with n = 2, 3, 4, 5. These basis sets are constructed analogous to Dunning's cc-pV n Z, but utilize the more flexible shape of NAOs. Moreover, an additional group of (sp) basis functions, called enhanced minimal basis, is established in NAO-VCC- n Z, increasing the contribution of the s and p functions to achieve the valence-correlation consistency. NAO-VCC- n Z basis sets are generated by minimizing frozen-core random-phase approximation (RPA) total energies of individual atoms from H to Ar. We demonstrate that NAO-VCC- n Z basis sets are suitable for converging electronic total-energy calculations based on valence-only (frozen-core) correlation methods which contain explicit sums over unoccupied states (e.g. the RPA or second-order M{\o}ller–Plesset perturbation theory). The basis set incompleteness error, including the basis set superposition error, can be gradually reduced with the increase of the index ‘ n ', and can be removed using two-point extrapolation schemes.},

The functional contains two parameters, the range separation and the short-range Fock fraction. Both are determined nonempirically, per system, on the basis of the satisfaction of exact physical constraints for the ionization potential and frontier-orbital many-electron self-interaction, respectively. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated on four important benchmark organic molecules: perylene, pentacene, 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic-dianydride (PTCDA), and 1,4,5,8-naphthalene-tetracarboxylic-dianhydride (NTCDA).

Within this framework, by keeping only the electron-hole contributions to the exchange kernel, two approximations can be obtained: An adiabatic connection analog of the second order screened exchange (AC-SOSEX) and an approximate electron-hole time-dependent Hartree-Fock (eh-TDHF). Here we show how this formalism is suitable for an efficient implementation within the plane-wave basis set. The response functions involved in the AC-SOSEX and eh-TDHF equations can indeed be compactly represented by an auxiliary basis set obtained from the diagonalization of an approximate dielectric matrix. Additionally, the explicit calculation of unoccupied states can be avoided by using density functional perturbation theory techniques and the matrix elements of dynamical response functions can be efficiently computed by applying the Lanczos algorithm. As shown by several applications to reaction energies and weakly bound dimers, the inclusion of the electron-hole kernel significantly improves the accuracy of ground-state correlation energies with respect to RPA and semi-local functionals.},

The orbital character of the bands and the bulk monolayer difference at the LDA level are discussed first. We find that the QSGW self-energy overestimates the gap by an unusually large amount. The main reason for this is identified to be the lattice polarization effect: The large LO-TO splittings in this polar material enhance the screening and reduce the screened Coulomb interaction affecting the gap. The effect is estimated to reduce the screened Coulomb interaction and hence the self-energy by a factor 0.38 (for bulk) and brings the calculated optical response functions in fairly good agreement with experiment. For monolayer V2O5 we find that the QSGW gap varies as 1/L with L the size of the spacing between the monolayers in a supercell. This results from the long-range nature of the self-energy $\Sigma$=iGW and the similar 1/L behavior of the dielectric screening.},

The triple-$\zeta$ Dunning aug′-cc-pVTZ+d and Pople 6-311+G(3df,2p)+d basis sets are found to be cost-effective for DHDFT methods.

abstract = {The electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) can be engineered by controlling their edge structure and width with atomic precision through bottom-up fabrication based on molecular precursors. This approach offers a unique platform for all-carbon electronic devices but requires careful optimization of the growth conditions to match structural requirements for successful device integration, with GNR length being the most critical parameter. In this work, the growth, characterization, and device integration of 5-atom wide armchair GNRs (5-AGNRs) are studied, which are expected to have an optimal bandgap as active material in switching devices. 5-AGNRs are obtained via on-surface synthesis under ultrahigh vacuum conditions from Br- and I-substituted precursors. It is shown that the use of I-substituted precursors and the optimization of the initial precursor coverage quintupled the average 5-AGNR length. This significant length increase allowed the integration of 5-AGNRs into devices and the realization of the first field-effect transistor based on narrow bandgap AGNRs that shows switching behavior at room temperature. The study highlights that the optimized growth protocols can successfully bridge between the sub-nanometer scale, where atomic precision is needed to control the electronic properties, and the scale of tens of nanometers relevant for successful device integration of GNRs.},

abstract = {Two aspects of TDDFT, the linear response approach and the adiabatic local density approximation, are examined from the perspective of lattice models. To this end, we review the DFT formulations on the lattice and give a concise presentation of the time-dependent Kadanoff-Baym equations, used to asses the limitations of the adiabatic approximation in TDDFT. We present results for the density response function of the 3D homogeneous Hubbard model, and point out a drawback of the linear response scheme based on the linearized Sham-Schl{\"{u}}ter equation. We then suggest a prescription on how to amend it. Finally, we analyze the time evolution of the density in a small cubic cluster, and compare exact, adiabatic-TDDFT and Kadanoff-Baym equations densities. Our results show that non-perturbative (in the interaction) adiabatic potentials can perform quite well for slow perturbations but that, for faster external fields, memory effects, as already present in simple many-body approximations, are clearly required. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach leads to a significant decrease in the computational cost of density fitting for Hartree-Fock theory while still producing results with errors 2-5 times smaller than standard, nonlocal density fitting. Our method allows for large Hartree-Fock and density functional theory computations with exact exchange to be carried out efficiently on large molecules, which we demonstrate by benchmarking our method on 200 of the most widely used prescription drug molecules. Our new fitting scheme leads to smooth and artifact-free potential energy surfaces and the possibility of relatively simple analytic gradients.},

The self-consistent Green's function (Formula presented) as derived from Dyson's equation, is used not only in the self-energy but also to construct the screened interaction W for a model system. For all approximations we observe a similar deterioration of the spectrum, which is not removed by vertex corrections. In particular, satellite peaks are systematically broadened and move closer to the chemical potential. The corresponding total energies are universally raised, independent of the system parameters. Our results, therefore, suggest that any improvement in total energy due to self-consistency, such as for the electron gas in the (Formula presented) approximation, may be fortuitous. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The phonons at the zone center are calculated for the layered material V2O5 using density functional perturbation theory and are compared with experimental infrared and Raman spectra from literature. We find that significantly better agreement is obtained when the pseudopotential treats vanadium semicore states 3s and 3p as bands. Remaining discrepancies are shown to be related to the local density approximation overestimate of the bond-stretch mode frequencies. The vibrational mode patterns are studied and presented in detail. The same method is then applied to well-separated monolayers. We find significant changes in some phonon frequencies. In particular, the highest-frequency vanadium vanadyl-oxygen stretch modes show a blue-shift of order 6{\%}-8{\%}. The origin of this blue-shift is analyzed in terms of the force-constant changes between bulk and monolayer and is found to arise from a delicate balance of short- and long-range dipolar force components. The latter are affected by the changes in dielectric constants and in the Born-effective charges. The red-shifts of some of the low-frequency modes are found also to be related to a reduction in force constants within the layer, rather than the removal of interlayer bonds. In this case, it is primarily motions along the x direction that are affected. The static and high-frequency dielectric constants are both found to be reduced in the monolayer. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

This "3B-69" benchmark set includes three-body interaction energies for 69 total trimer structures, consisting of three structures from each of 23 different molecular crystals. By including structures that exhibit a variety of intermolecular interactions and packing arrangements, this set provides a stringent test for the ability of electronic structure methods to describe the correct physics involved in the interactions. Both MP2.5 (the average of second- and third-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory) and spin-component-scaled CCSD for noncovalent interactions (SCS-MI-CCSD) perform well. MP2 handles the polarization aspects reasonably well, but it omits three-body dispersion. In contrast, many widely used density functionals corrected with three-body D3 dispersion correction perform comparatively poorly. The primary difficulty stems from the treatment of exchange and polarization in the functionals rather than from the dispersion correction, though the three-body dispersion may also be moderately underestimated by the D3 correction.},

abstract = {In many paradigmatic materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, the role played by the spin degrees of freedom is as important as the one played by the electron-electron interaction. Thus an accurate treatment of the two effects and of their interaction is necessary for an accurate and predictive study of the optical and electronic properties of these materials. Despite the fact that the GW-BSE approach correctly accounts for electronic correlations, the spin-orbit coupling effect is often neglected or treated perturbatively. Recently, spinorial formulations of GW-BSE have become available in different flavors in material-science codes. However, an accurate validation and comparison of different approaches is still missing. In this work, we go through the derivation of the noncollinear GW-BSE approach. The scheme is applied to transition metal dichalcogenides comparing the perturbative and full spinorial approaches. Our calculations reveal that dark-bright exciton splittings are generally improved when the spin-orbit coupling is included nonperturbatively. The exchange-driven intravalley mixing between the A and B excitons is found to play a role for Mo-based systems, being especially strong in the case of MoSe2. We finally compute the excitonic spin and use it to sharply analyze the spinorial properties of transition metal dichalcogenide excitonic states.},

abstract = {A benchmark database of forward and reverse barrier heights for 19 non-hydrogen-transfer reactions has been developed by using Weizmann 1 calculations, and 29 DFT methods and 6 ab initio wave-function theory (WFT) methods have been tested against the new database as well as against an older database for hydrogen atom transfer reactions. Among the tested hybrid DFT methods without kinetic energy density, MPW1K is the most accurate model for calculations of barrier heights. Among the tested hybrid meta DFT methods, BB1K and MPWB1K are the two most accurate models for the calculations of barrier heights. Overall, the results show that BB1K and MPWB1K are the two best DFT methods for calculating barrier heights, followed in order by MPW1K, MPWKCIS1K, B1B95, MPW1B95, BHandHLYP, B97-2, mPW1PW91, and B98. The popular B3LYP method has a mean unsigned error four times larger than that of BB1K. Of the methods tested, QCISD(T) is the best ab initio WFT method for barrier height calculations, and QCISD is second best, but QCISD is outperformed by the BB1K, MPWB1K, MPWKCIS1K, and MPW1K methods. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We present a simple approach for the reduction of the size of auxiliary basis sets used in methods exploiting the density fitting (resolution of identity) approximation for electron repulsion integrals. Starting out of the singular value decomposition of three-center two-electron integrals, new auxiliary functions are constructed as linear combinations of the original fitting functions. The new functions, which we term natural auxiliary functions (NAFs), are analogous to the natural orbitals widely used for the cost reduction of correlation methods. The use of the NAF basis enables the systematic truncation of the fitting basis, and thereby potentially the reduction of the computational expenses of the methods, though the scaling with the system size is not altered. The performance of the new approach has been tested for several quantum chemical methods. It is demonstrated that the most pronounced gain in computational efficiency can be expected for iterative models which scale quadratically with the size of the fitting basis set, such as the direct random phase approximation. The approach also has the promise of accelerating local correlation methods, for which the processing of three-center Coulomb integrals is a bottleneck.},

abstract = {A formalism for electronic-structure calculations is presented that is based on the functional renormalization group (FRG). The traditional FRG has been formulated for systems that exhibit a translational symmetry with an associated Fermi surface, which can provide the organization principle for the renormalization group (RG) procedure. We here advance an alternative formulation, where the RG flow is organized in the energy-domain rather than in k space. This has the advantage that it can also be applied to inhomogeneous matter lacking a band structure, such as disordered metals or molecules. The energy-domain FRG (ϵFRG) presented here accounts for Fermi-liquid corrections to quasiparticle energies and particle-hole excitations. It goes beyond the state of the art GW-BSE, because in ϵFRG the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is solved in a self-consistent manner. An efficient implementation of the approach that has been tested against exact diagonalization calculations and calculations based on the density matrix renormalization group is presented. Similar to the conventional FRG, also the ϵFRG is able to signalize the vicinity of an instability of the Fermi-liquid fixed point via runaway flow of the corresponding interaction vertex. Embarking upon this fact, in an application of ϵFRG to the spinless disordered Hubbard model we calculate its phase boundary in the plane spanned by the interaction and disorder strength. Finally, an extension of the approach to finite temperatures and spin S=1/2 is also given.},

The methodology, originally developed for the first row atoms [T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 90, (1989)] is first applied to sulfur. The exponents for the polarization functions (dfgh) are systematically optimized for a correlated wave function (HF+1+2). The (sp) correlation functions are taken from the appropriate HF primitive sets; it is shown that these functions differ little from the optimum functions. Basis sets of double zeta [4s3p1d], triple zeta [5s4p2d1f], and quadruple zeta [6s5p3d2f1g] quality are defined. Each of these sets is then augmented with diffuse functions to better describe electron affinities and other molecular properties: s and p functions were obtained by optimization for the anion HF energy, while an additional polarization function for each symmetry present in the standard set was optimized for the anion HF+1+2 energy. The results for sulfur are then used to assist in determining double zeta, triple zeta, and quadruple zeta basis sets for the remainder of the second row of the p block. {\textcopyright} 1993 American Institute of Physics.},

Results for a test set of reaction energies show that only very few Laplace grid points are needed to obtain converged energy differences and that PNO-CCSD(T) is a more robust approximation than PNO-CCSD(T0) with a reduced mean absolute deviation from canonical CCSD(T) results. We combine the PNO-based (T) triples correction with the explicitly correlated PNO-CCSD(F12∗) method and investigate the use of specialized F12-PNOs in the conventional triples correction.

In order to increase computational performance while maintaining accuracy, we propose here to reduce the number of primitive Gaussian functions of the contracted auxiliary basis functions by means of a second Cholesky decomposition. Test calculations show that this procedure is most beneficial in conjunction with highly contracted atomic orbital basis sets such as atomic natural orbitals, and that the error resulting from the second decomposition is negligible. We also demonstrate theoretically as well as computationally that the locality of the fitting coefficients can be controlled by means of the decomposition threshold even with the long-ranged Coulomb metric. Cholesky decomposition-based auxiliary basis sets are thus ideally suited for local density fitting approximations.},

Our computational framework, which employs a real-space basis for ground-state and a transition-space basis for excited-state calculations, is well suited for high-accuracy calculations on molecules, as we show by comparing against G0W0 calculations within a plane-wave-basis formalism. We then generalize our framework to test variants of the GW approximation that include a local density approximation (LDA)-derived vertex function ($\Gamma$LDA) and quasiparticle-self-consistent (QS) iterations. We find that $\Gamma$LDA and quasiparticle self-consistency shift IPs and EAs by roughly the same magnitude, but with opposite sign for IPs and the same sign for EAs. G0W0 and QSGW$\Gamma$LDA are more accurate for IPs, while G0W0$\Gamma$LDA and QSGW are best for EAs. For optical excitations, we find that perturbative GW-BSE underestimates the singlet excitation energy, while self-consistent GW-BSE results in good agreement with previous best-estimate values for both valence and Rydberg excitations. Finally, our work suggests that a hybrid approach, in which G0W0 energies are used for occupied orbitals and G0W0$\Gamma$LDA for unoccupied orbitals, also yields optical excitation energies in good agreement with experiment but at a smaller computational cost.},

abstract = {Using an implementation based on real-space wave functions, we perform G0W0 calculations of the HOMO and LUMO energies of molecules and atoms in the GW100 set. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) Different implementations of the G0W0 approximation show much better agreements for HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energies than for LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energies. The mean absolute differences between the results calculated with different pseudopotential codes range from 100 to 200 meV. For delocalized LUMOs, all-electron codes that use local orbital basis tend to predict much higher energies than those calculated with plane-wave basis or real-space methods. (2) The effects of semicore electrons in pseudopotentials can explain some of the large discrepancies between results calculated with different GW implementations. For molecules or atoms that include I, Xe, and Ga, pseudopotential-based calculations that exclude semicore electrons produce results that agree better with all-electron calculations. For polar molecules such as NaCl and BrK, however, it is necessary to include semicore electrons for alkaline metal elements to get correct LUMO energies. (3) More than 20 molecules show rearrangement of the order between LUMO (or HOMO) with other orbitals due to GW corrections. Such orbitals that switch order with LUMO are unbound and delocalized in space. The predicted LUMO GW levels (or electron affinity) can be corrected by 2.0 eV if we consider the rearrangement of orbitals in GW calculations. In all, our work clarifies some of the discrepancies between different GW codes and sets a benchmark for real-space implementations of the G0W0 approximation.},

abstract = {We investigate charge transfer in prototypical molecular donor-acceptor compounds using hybrid density functional theory (DFT) and the GW approximation at the perturbative level (G0W0) and at full self-consistency (sc-GW). For the systems considered here, no charge transfer should be expected at large intermolecular separation according to photoemission experiments and accurate quantum-chemistry calculations. The capability of hybrid exchange-correlation functionals of reproducing this feature depends critically on the fraction of exact exchange $\alpha$, as for small values of $\alpha$ spurious fractional charge transfer is observed between the donor and the acceptor. G0W0 based on hybrid DFT yields the correct alignment of the frontier orbitals for all values of $\alpha$. However, G0W0 has no capacity to alter the ground-state properties of the system because of its perturbative nature. The electron density in donor-acceptor compounds thus remains incorrect for small $\alpha$ values. In sc-GW, where the Green's function is obtained from the iterative solution of the Dyson equation, the electron density is updated and reflects the correct description of the level alignment at the GW level, demonstrating the importance of self-consistent many-body approaches for the description of ground- and excited-state properties in donor-acceptor systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

Phys. $\backslash$textbf{\{}138{\}}, 244104 (2013)], we describe a simplified approach to excited state calculations within the GW approximation to the self-energy and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), which we call sGW/sBSE. The primary simplification to the electron repulsion integrals yields the same structure as with tensor hypercontraction, such that our method has a storage requirement that grows quadratically with system size and computational timing that grows cubically with system size. The performance of sGW is tested on the ionization potential of the molecules in the GW100 test set, for which it differs from $\backslash$textit{\{}ab intio{\}} GW calculations by only 0.2 eV. The performance of sBSE (based on sGW input) is tested on the excitation energies of molecules in the Thiel set, for which it differs from $\backslash$textit{\{}ab intio{\}} GW/BSE calculations by about 0.5 eV. As examples of the systems that can be routinely studied with sGW/sBSE, we calculate the band gap and excitation energy of hydrogen-passivated silicon nanocrystals with up to 2650 electrons in 4678 spatial orbitals and the absorption spectra of two large organic dye molecules with hundreds of atoms.},

abstract = {We describe a recent implementation of the combined GW and dynamical mean field method (GW+DMFT) for the two-dimensional Hubbard model with onsite and nearest-neighbor repulsion. We clarify the relation of the GW+DMFT scheme to alternative approaches in the literature, and discuss the corresponding approximations to the free-energy functional of the model. Furthermore, we describe a numerically exact technique for the solution of the GW+DMFT equations, namely, the hybridization expansion continuous-time algorithm for impurity models with retarded interactions. We compute the low-temperature phase diagram of the half-filled extended Hubbard model, addressing the metal-insulator transition at small intersite interactions and the transition to a charge-ordered state for stronger intersite repulsions. GW+DMFT introduces a nontrivial momentum dependence into the many-body self-energy and polarization. We find that the charge fluctuations included in the present approach have a larger impact on the latter than on the former. Finally, within the GW+DMFT framework, as in extended DMFT, the intersite repulsion translates into a frequency dependence of the local effective interaction. We analyze this dependence and show how it affects the local spectral function. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

It is found that the first-order vertex and self-consistency corrections to the polarizability largely compensate each other. This does not hold, however, for the first-order corrections to the (Formula presented) gap. For silicon the compensation between the first-order vertex and self-consistency correction contributions to the gap is only about 35{\%}, while for diamond it is even absent. The resulting gap values are significantly and systematically too large, the direct gaps for silicon and diamond being 0.4 eV and 0.7 eV larger than their (Formula presented) values, respectively.

The resulting density functional is nearly local and predicts a substantial correction to the RPA correlation energy of an atom but very small corrections to the RPA atomization energy of a molecule, which may by itself come close to “chemical accuracy” and to the RPA surface energy of a metal.

Similar to the ubiquitous adiabatic approximation of time-dependent density-functional theory, the static approximation, which substitutes a dynamical (i.e., frequency-dependent) kernel by its static limit, is usually enforced in most implementations of the BSE formalism. Here, going beyond the static approximation, we compute the dynamical correction of the electron-hole screening for molecular excitation energies, thanks to a renormalized first-order perturbative correction to the static BSE excitation energies. The present dynamical correction goes beyond the plasmon-pole approximation as the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction is computed exactly within the random-phase approximation. Our calculations are benchmarked against high-level (coupled-cluster) calculations, allowing one to assess the clear improvement brought by the dynamical correction for both singlet and triplet optical transitions.},

abstract = {Three-center nuclear attraction integrals, which arise in density functional and ab initio calculations, are one of the most time-consuming computations involved in molecular electronic structure calculations. Even for relatively small systems, millions of these laborious calculations need to be executed. Highly efficient and accurate methods for evaluating molecular integrals are therefore all the more vital in order to perform the calculations necessary for large systems. When using a basis set of B functions, an analytical expression for the three-center nuclear attraction integrals can be derived via the Fourier transform method. However, due to the presence of the highly oscillatory semi-infinite spherical Bessel integral, the analytical expression still remains problematic. By applying the S transformation, the spherical Bessel integral can be converted into a much more favorable sine integral. In the present work, we then apply two types of double exponential transformations to the resulting sine integral, which leads to a highly efficient and accurate quadrature formula. This method facilitates the approximation of the molecular integrals to a high predetermined accuracy, while still keeping the calculation times low. The fast convergence properties analyzed in the numerical section illustrate the advantages of the method.},

abstract = {Accurate predictions of charge excitation energies of molecules in the disordered condensed phase are central to the chemical reactivity, stability, and optoelectronic properties of molecules and critically depend on the specific environment. Herein, we develop a stochastic GW method for calculating these charge excitation energies. The approach employs maximally localized electronic states to define the electronic subspace of a molecule and the rest of the system, both of which are randomly sampled. We test the method on three solute-solvent systems: phenol, thymine, and phenylalanine in water. The results are in excellent agreement with the previous high-level calculations and available experimental data. The stochastic calculations for supercells containing up to 1000 electrons representing the solvated systems are inexpensive and require com.elsevier.xml.ani.Math@479ed945 central processing unit hrs. We find that the coupling with the environment accounts for com.elsevier.xml.ani.Math@45ff6c90 of the total correlation energy. The solvent-to-solute feedback mechanism incorporated in the molecular correlation term causes up to 0.6 eV destabilization of the quasiparticle energy. Simulated photo-emission spectra exhibit red shifts, state-degeneracy lifting, and lifetime shortening. Our method provides an efficient approach for an accurate study of excitations of large molecules in realistic condensed phase environments.},

The OSV model is a local correlation ansatz with a small basis of virtual functions for each occupied orbital. It is related to the Pulay-Saeb{\o} approach, in which domains of virtual orbitals are drawn from a single set of projected atomic orbitals; but here the virtual functions associated with a particular occupied orbital are specifically tailored to the correlation effects in which that orbital participates. In this study, the shapes of the OSVs are optimized simultaneously with the OSV-MP2 amplitudes by minimizing the Hylleraas functional or approximations to it. It is found that optimized OSVs are considerably more accurate than the OSVs obtained through singular value decomposition of diagonal blocks of MP2 amplitudes, as used in our earlier work. Orbital-optimized OSV-MP2 recovers smooth potential energy surfaces regardless of the number of virtuals. Full optimization is still computationally demanding, but orbital optimization in a diagonal or Kapuy-type MP2 approximation provides an attractive scheme for determining accurate OSVs.},

Then we obtain the optical dielectric constants ϵ∞(Slab) from the differences of the slopes of the electrostatic potential in the bulk and vacuum regions. Calculated ϵ∞(Slab) show very good agreement with experiments. For example, we have ϵ∞(Slab)=2.91 for MgO, in agreement with the experimental value ϵ∞(Experiment)=2.96. This is in contrast to ϵ∞(RPA)=2.37, which is calculated in the random-phase approximation for the bulk MgO in QSGW. After we explain the difference between the quasiparticle-based perturbation theory and the Green's-function-based perturbation theory, we interpret the large difference ϵ∞(Slab)-ϵ∞(RPA)=2.91-2.37 as the contribution from the vertex correction of the proper polarization, which determines the screened Coulomb interaction W.

Refined strategies for feature design and selection are presented, and the molecular-orbital-based machine learning (MOB-ML) method is applied to several test systems. Strikingly, for the MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T) levels of theory, it is shown that the thermally accessible (350 K) potential energy surface for a single water molecule can be described to within 1 millihartree using a model that is trained from only a single reference calculation at a randomized geometry. To explore the breadth of chemical diversity that can be described, MOB-ML is also applied to a new dataset of thermalized (350 K) geometries of 7211 organic models with up to seven heavy atoms. In comparison with the previously reported {\$}\backslashDelta{\$}-ML method, MOB-ML is shown to reach chemical accuracy with three-fold fewer training geometries. Finally, a transferability test in which models trained for seven-heavy-atom systems are used to predict energies for thirteen-heavy-atom systems reveals that MOB-ML reaches chemical accuracy with 36-fold fewer training calculations than {\$}\backslashDelta{\$}-ML (140 versus 5000 training calculations).},

abstract = {We present a diagrammatic approach to construct self-energy approximations within many-body perturbation theory with positive spectral properties. The method cures the problem of negative spectral functions which arises from a straightforward inclusion of vertex diagrams beyond the GW approximation. Our approach consists of a two-step procedure: We first express the approximate many-body self-energy as a product of half-diagrams and then identify the minimal number of half-diagrams to add in order to form a perfect square. The resulting self-energy is an unconventional sum of self-energy diagrams in which the internal lines of half a diagram are time-ordered Green's functions, whereas those of the other half are anti-time-ordered Green's functions, and the lines joining the two halves are either lesser or greater Green's functions. The theory is developed using noninteracting Green's functions and subsequently extended to self-consistent Green's functions. Issues related to the conserving properties of diagrammatic approximations with positive spectral functions are also addressed. As a major application of the formalism we derive the minimal set of additional diagrams to make positive the spectral function of the GW approximation with lowest-order vertex corrections and screened interactions. The method is then applied to vertex corrections in the three-dimensional homogeneous electron gas by using a combination of analytical frequency integrations and numerical Monte Carlo momentum integrations to evaluate the diagrams.},

Overall, the OSV-LCCSD approach together with an MP2 correction yields small domain errors in practical calculations. The applicability of the OSV-LCCSD is demonstrated for molecules with up to 73 atoms and realistic basis sets (up to 2334 basis functions).},

abstract = {Quasi-particle energies and band gaps in particular are critical for investigating novel materials. Commonly used density functional approximations (DFAs) systematically underestimate band gaps, and GW approximation is the established method of choice for good accuracy and reliability. However, G 0 W 0 has some undesired dependence on the DFA, while self-consistent GW (scGW) is expensive and not consistent in accuracy improvement. Here a simple and efficient G RS W 0 approach has been developed: a subspace diagonalization of the Hartree-Fock (HF) Hamiltonian with the DFA density matrix provides the new reference Green's function G RS that incorporates the effect of all single excitation contributions to the self-energy, thereby essentially eliminating the starting-point dependence. Calculations for molecules and large band gap solids demonstrate the significant improvement over G 0 W 0 and greatly reduced dependence on the initial DFA. G RS W 0 approach also improve results for other bulks over G 0 W 0 , but to a lesser extent, which could be due to the limitations in current implementation for bulks. The results demonstrate that to achieve good accuracy, it is not necessary to use hybrid DFA, which is expensive for bulks. This work should be greatly significant in making GW a more robust approach. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {Prompted by recent reports of large errors in noncovalent interaction (NI) energies obtained from many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), we compare the performance of second-order Moller-Plesset MBPT (MP2), spin-scaled MP2, dispersion-corrected semilocal density functional approximations (DFAs), and post-Kohn-Sham random phase approximation (RPA) for predicting binding energies of supramolecular complexes contained in the S66, L7, and S30L benchmarks. All binding energies are extrapolated to the basis set limit, corrected for basis set superposition errors, and compared to reference results of the domain-based local pair-natural orbital coupled-cluster (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) or better quality. Our results confirm that MP2 severely overestimates binding energies of large complexes, producing relative errors of over 100{\%} for several benchmark compounds. RPA relative errors consistently range between 5 and 10{\%}, significantly less than reported previously using smaller basis sets, whereas spin-scaled MP2 methods show limitations similar to MP2, albeit less pronounced, and empirically dispersion-corrected DFAs perform almost as well as RPA. Regression analysis reveals a systematic increase of relative MP2 binding energy errors with the system size at a rate of approximately 0.1{\%} per valence electron, whereas the RPA and dispersion-corrected DFA relative errors are virtually independent of the system size. These observations are corroborated by a comparison of computed rotational constants of organic molecules to gas-phase spectroscopy data contained in the ROT34 benchmark. To analyze these results, an asymptotic adiabatic connection symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (AC-SAPT) is developed, which uses monomers at full coupling, whose ground-state density is constrained to the ground-state density of the complex. Using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we obtain a nonperturbative "screened second-order" expression for the dispersion energy in terms of monomer quantities, which is exact for non-overlapping subsystems and free of induction terms; a first-order RPA-like approximation to the Hartree, exchange, and correlation kernel recovers the macroscopic Lifshitz limit. The AC-SAPT expansion of the interaction energy is obtained from Taylor expansion of the coupling strength integrand. Explicit expressions for the convergence radius of the AC-SAPT series are derived within RPA and MBPT and numerically evaluated. While the AC-SAPT expansion is always convergent for nondegenerate monomers when RPA is used, it is found to spuriously diverge for second-order MBPT, except for the smallest and least polarizable monomers. The divergence of the AC-SAPT series for MBPT is numerically confirmed within RPA; prior numerical results on the convergence of the SAPT expansion for MBPT methods are revisited and support this conclusion once sufficiently high orders are included. The cause of the failure of MBPT methods for NIs of large systems is missing or incomplete "electrodynamic" screening of the Coulomb interaction due to induced particle-hole pairs between electrons in different monomers, leaving the effective interaction too strong for AC-SAPT to converge. Hence, MBPT cannot be considered reliable for quantitative predictions of NIs, even in moderately polarizable molecules with a few tens of atoms. The failure to accurately account for electrodynamic polarization makes MBPT qualitatively unsuitable for applications such as NIs of nanostructures, macromolecules, and soft materials; more robust nonperturbative approaches such as RPA or coupled cluster methods should be used instead whenever possible.},

Here the authors present a simple approximation where the orbitals are optimized with the mean-field energy plus a correlation energy taken as the opposite-spin component of the second-order many-body correlation energy, scaled by an empirically chosen parameter (recommended as 1.2 for general applications). This "optimized second-order opposite-spin" (abbreviated as O2) method requires fourth-order computation on each orbital iteration. O2 is shown to yield predictions of structure and frequencies for closed-shell molecules that are very similar to scaled second-order Moller-Plesset methods.

For an unbiased comparison and to prevent spurious starting point effects, both approaches are iterated to full self-consistency (i.e., sc-RPA and sc-GW). The exchange-correlation diagrams in both approaches are topologically identical, but in sc-RPA they are evaluated with noninteracting and in sc-GW with interacting Green functions. This has a profound consequence for the dissociation region, where sc-RPA is superior to sc-GW. We argue that for a given diagrammatic expansion, sc-RPA outperforms sc-GW when it comes to bond breaking. We attribute this to the difference in the correlation energy rather than the treatment of the kinetic energy. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Quantum chemical calculations are important for elucidating light-capturing mechanisms in photobiological systems. The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) has become a popular methodology because of its balance between accuracy and computational scaling, despite its problems in describing, for example, charge transfer states. As a step toward systematically understanding the performance of TDDFT calculations on biomolecular systems, we study here 17 commonly used density functionals, including seven long-range separated functionals, and compare the obtained results with excitation energies calculated at the approximate second order coupled-cluster theory level (CC2). The benchmarking set includes the first five singlet excited states of 11 chemical analogues of biochromophores from the green fluorescent protein, rhodopsin/bacteriorhodopsin (Rh/bR), and the photoactive yellow protein. We find that commonly used pure density functionals such as BP86, PBE, M11-L, and hybrid functionals with 20-25{\%} of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange (B3LYP, PBE0) have a tendency to consistently underestimate vertical excitation energies (VEEs) relative to the CC2 values, whereas hybrid density functionals with around 50{\%} HF exchange such as BHLYP, PBE50, and M06-2X and long-range corrected functionals such as CAM-B3LYP, $\omega$PBE, $\omega$PBEh, $\omega$B97X, $\omega$B97XD, BNL, and M11 overestimate the VEEs. We observe that calculations using the CAM-B3LYP and $\omega$PBEh functionals with 65{\%} and 100{\%} long-range HF exchange, respectively, lead to an overestimation of the VEEs by 0.2-0.3 eV for the benchmarking set. To reduce the systematic error, we introduce here two new empirical functionals, CAMh-B3LYP and $\omega$hPBE0, for which we adjusted the long-range HF exchange to 50{\%}. The introduced parameterization reduces the mean signed average (MSA) deviation to 0.07 eV and the root mean square (rms) deviation to 0.17 eV as compared to the CC2 values. In the present study, TDDFT calculations using the aug-def2-TZVP basis sets, the best performing functionals relative to CC2 are $\omega$hPBE0 (rms = 0.17, MSA = 0.06 eV); CAMh-B3LYP (rms = 0.16, MSA = 0.07 eV); and PBE0 (rms = 0.23, MSA =-0.14 eV). For the popular range-separated CAM-B3LYP functional, we obtain an rms value of 0.31 eV and an MSA value of 0.25 eV, which can be compared with the rms and MSA values of 0.37 and-0.31 eV, respectively, as obtained at the B3LYP level.},

Ten neutral and three positively charged complexes with experimental $\Delta$G(a) values in the range 0 to -21 kcal mol(-1) (on average -6 kcal mol(-1)) are investigated. The theoretical approach employs a (nondynamic) single-structure model, but computes the various energy terms accurately without any special empirical adjustments. Dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) with extended basis sets (triple-$\zeta$ and quadruple-$\zeta$ quality) is used to determine structures and gas-phase interaction energies ($\Delta$E), the COSMO-RS continuum solvation model (based on DFT data) provides solvation free enthalpies and the remaining ro-vibrational enthalpic/entropic contributions are obtained from harmonic frequency calculations. Low-lying vibrational modes are treated by a free-rotor approximation. The accurate account of London dispersion interactions is mandatory with contributions in the range -5 to -60 kcal mol(-1) (up to 200{\%} of $\Delta$E). Inclusion of three-body dispersion effects improves the results considerably. A semilocal (TPSS) and a hybrid density functional (PW6B95) have been tested. Although the $\Delta$G(a) values result as a sum of individually large terms with opposite sign ($\Delta$E vs. solvation and entropy change), the approach provides unprecedented accuracy for $\Delta$G(a) values with errors of only 2 kcal mol(-1) on average. Relative affinities for different guests inside the same host are always obtained correctly. The procedure is suggested as a predictive tool in supramolecular chemistry and can be applied routinely to semirigid systems with 300-400 atoms. The various contributions to binding and enthalpy-entropy compensations are discussed.},

To approach the basis set limit with potentially lower computational cost, a new self-consistent field (SCF) scheme is presented that employs minimal adaptive basis (MAB) functions. The MAB functions are optimized on each atomic site by minimizing a surrogate function. High accuracy is obtained by applying a perturbative correction (PC) to the MAB calculation, similar to dual basis approaches. Compared to exact SCF results, using this MAB-SCF (PC) approach with the same large target basis set produces {\textless}0.15 kcal/mol root-mean-square deviations for most of the tested TC datasets, and {\textless}0.1 kcal/mol for most of the NC datasets. The performance of density functionals near the basis set limit can be even better reproduced. With further improvement to its implementation, MAB-SCF (PC) is a promising lower-cost substitute for conventional large-basis calculations as a method to approach the basis set limit of modern density functionals.},

The Sternheimer-GW method consists of calculating the GW self-energy operator without resorting to the standard expansion over unoccupied Kohn-Sham electronic states. The Green's function is calculated by solving linear systems for frequencies along the real axis. The screened Coulomb interaction is calculated for frequencies along the imaginary axis by using the Sternheimer equation. Analytic continuation to the real axis is performed using Pad{\'{e}} approximants. The generalized plasmon-pole approximation is avoided by performing explicit calculations at multiple frequencies using Frommer's multishift solver. We demonstrate our methodology by reporting tests on common insulators and semiconductors, including Si, diamond, LiCl, and SiC. Our calculated quasiparticle energies are in agreement with the results of fully converged calculations based on the sum-over-states approach. As the Sternheimer-GW method yields the complete self-energy $\Sigma$(r,r ′,$\omega$) and not only its expectation values on Kohn-Sham states, this work opens the way to nonperturbative GW calculations and to direct calculations of spectral functions for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

abstract = {Using seven semiconductors and insulators with band gaps covering the range from 1 to 10 eV we systematically explore the performance of two different variants of self-consistency associated with the famous Hedin system of equations: the full self-consistency and the so-called quasiparticle approximation to it. The pros and cons of these two variants of self-consistency are sufficiently well documented in the literature for the simplest GW approximation to the Hedin equations. Our study, therefore, aims primarily at the level of theory beyond GW approximation, i.e., at the level of theory which includes vertex corrections. Whereas quasiparticle self-consistency has certain advantages at the GW level (a well-known fact), the situation becomes quite different when vertex corrections are included. In the variant with full self-consistency, vertex corrections (both for polarizability and for self-energy) systematically reduce the calculated band gaps making them closer to the experimental values. In the variant with quasiparticle self-consistency, however, an inclusion of the same diagrams has a considerably larger effect and calculated band gaps become severely underestimated. Different effects of vertex corrections in two variants of self-consistency can be related to the Z-factor cancellation which plays a positive role in quasiparticle self-consistency at the GW level of theory but appears to be destructive for the quasiparticle approximation when higher-order diagrams are included. The second result of our study is that we were able to reproduce the results obtained with the questaal code using our flapwmbpt code when the same variant of self-consistency (quasiparticle) and the same level of vertex corrections (for polarizability only, static approximation for screened interaction, and Tamm-Dancoff approximation for the Bethe-Salpeter equation) are used.},

Here, we developed a different approach to orbital localization, in which these constraints are replaced with a single restriction that specifies the maximum allowed deviation from the orthogonality for the final set of localized orbitals. This reformulation, which can be viewed as a generalization of existing localization methods, enables one to choose the desired balance between the orthogonality and locality of the orbitals.

abstract = {Charged defects in two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerging applications in quantum technologies such as quantum emitters and quantum computation. The advancement of these technologies requires a rational design of ideal defect centers, demanding reliable computation methods for the quantitatively accurate prediction of defect properties. We present an accurate, parameter-free, and efficient procedure to evaluate the quasiparticle defect states and thermodynamic charge transition levels of defects in 2D materials. Importantly, we solve critical issues that stem from the strongly anisotropic screening in 2D materials, that have so far precluded the accurate prediction of charge transition levels in these materials. Using this procedure, we investigate various defects in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) for their charge transition levels, stable spin states, and optical excitations. We identify C B V N (nitrogen vacancy adjacent to carbon substitution of boron) to be the most promising defect candidate for scalable quantum bit and emitter applications. Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and transition-metal dichalcogenides exhibit a wide range of remarkable properties at atomic-scale layer thicknesses, holding promise for both conventional and new optoelectronic functionalities at drastically reduced dimensions [1-5]. It is well established that point defects play a central role in the properties of bulk three-dimensional (3D) semiconductors but their corresponding role in 2D materials is not yet well understood. In particular, the weak screening environment surrounding the defect charge distribution and the strong confinement of wave functions due to the atomic-scale thickness could lead to vastly different behaviors compared to conventional semiconductors. Defects in 2D materials such as h-BN show promise as polarized and ultrabright single-photon emitters at room temperature [6,7], with potentially better scalability [8,9] than the long-studied nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) in diamond [10-12] for emerging applications in nanophotonics and quantum information [13]. Progress beyond the initial experimental demonstration of promising properties requires the rational design and development of quantum defects in 2D materials that exhibit a high emission rate, long coherence time, single photon purity, and stability. Specifically, the promising defects should have the following properties: Defect levels should be deep (far from the band edges) to avoid resonance with the bulk band edges and thereby exhibit a long coherence time [6,14,15]; optically addressable spin conserving excita-tions facilitate exploiting spin-selective decays in high-spin defect states, similar to the NV center in diamond [16-18]; anisotropic polarization of the defect states in combination with quantum bits could provide a pathway to quantum optical computation. A recent work [18] performed density functional theory (DFT) and constraint DFT calculations to obtain the Huang-Rhys factor and photoluminescence spectrum for mul-* yuanping@ucsc.edu tiple neutral defects in h-BN, while the possibility of forming charged defects has not been examined. Most importantly, a higher level of theory beyond DFT is necessary to obtain accurate defect charge transition levels, which has not been carried out for charged defects in 2D materials due to several technical difficulties that will be resolved here. In this Rapid Communication, we use first-principles methods to theoretically investigate the suitability of several complex defects in monolayer h-BN for quantum bit and emitter applications. We choose n-type defects which are closely related to common intrinsic and extrinsic defects in BN and can potentially create several occupied defect levels in the band gap and high spin states. For each candidate defect, we examine the charge transition level (CTL) which determines the stability ranges of various charge states of each defect. For each stable charge state, we evaluate spin states and optical excitations along different polarization directions. With these calculations, we will show C B V N (a nitrogen vacancy adjacent to boron substituted by carbon, as shown in Fig. 1) to be the most promising defect in 2D h-BN, analogous to the NV center in 3D diamond, which has a stable triplet ground state and a bright anisotropic optical transition between defect levels. However, calculating the properties such as CTLs and optical excitations of charged defects in 2D materials present serious challenges for state-of-the-art first-principles methods, which have so far limited the accuracy of previous calculations. We start this Rapid Communication by outlining these challenges and then discuss our methodology to address them. The formation energy of a defect in charge state q, ionic coordinates R, and electron chemical potential $\epsilon$ F (often set to the valence band maximum for insulators or semiconductors) is given by [19] E f q (R)[$\epsilon$ F ] = E q (R) − E pst + i $\mu$ i N i + q$\epsilon$ F. (1) Here, E q (R) is the total energy of the system with the charged defect, and E pst is the total energy of the pristine system. 2475-9953/2017/1(7)/071001(6) 071001-1},

abstract = {Abstract Seven different types of Slater type basis sets for the elements H (Z = 1) up to E118 (Z = 118), ranging from a double zeta valence quality up to a quadruple zeta valence quality, are tested in their performance in neutral atomic and diatomic oxide calculations. The exponents of the Slater type functions are optimized for the use in (scalar relativistic) zeroth?order regular approximated (ZORA) equations. Atomic tests reveal that, on average, the absolute basis set error of 0.03 kcal/mol in the density functional calculation of the valence spinor energies of the neutral atoms with the largest all electron basis set of quadruple zeta quality is lower than the average absolute difference of 0.16 kcal/mol in these valence spinor energies if one compares the results of ZORA equation with those of the fully relativistic Dirac equation. This average absolute basis set error increases to about 1 kcal/mol for the all electron basis sets of triple zeta valence quality, and to approximately 4 kcal/mol for the all electron basis sets of double zeta quality. The molecular tests reveal that, on average, the calculated atomization energies of 118 neutral diatomic oxides MO, where the nuclear charge Z of M ranges from Z = 1?118, with the all electron basis sets of triple zeta quality with two polarization functions added are within 1?2 kcal/mol of the benchmark results with the much larger all electron basis sets, which are of quadruple zeta valence quality with four polarization functions added. The accuracy is reduced to about 4?5 kcal/mol if only one polarization function is used in the triple zeta basis sets, and further reduced to approximately 20 kcal/mol if the all electron basis sets of double zeta quality are used. The inclusion of g?type STOs to the large benchmark basis sets had an effect of less than 1 kcal/mol in the calculation of the atomization energies of the group 2 and group 14 diatomic oxides. The basis sets that are optimized for calculations using the frozen core approximation (frozen core basis sets) have a restricted basis set in the core region compared to the all electron basis sets. On average, the use of these frozen core basis sets give atomic basis set errors that are approximately twice as large as the corresponding all electron basis set errors and molecular atomization energies that are close to the corresponding all electron results. Only if spin?orbit coupling is included in the frozen core calculations larger errors are found, especially for the heavier elements, due to the additional approximation that is made that the basis functions are orthogonalized on scalar relativistic core orbitals. ? 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Electron propagator theory provides a practical means of calculating electron binding energies, Dyson orbitals, and ground-state properties from first principles. This approach to ab initio electronic structure theory also facilitates the interpretation of its quantitative predictions in terms of concepts that closely resemble those of one-electron theories. An explanation of the physical meaning of the electron propagator's poles and residues is followed by a discussion of its couplings to more complicated propagators. These relationships are exploited in superoperator theory and lead to a compact form of the electron propagator that is derived by matrix partitioning. Expressions for reference-state properties, relationships to the extended Koopmans's theorem technique for evaluating electron binding energies, and connections between Dyson orbitals and transition probabilities follow from this discussion. The inverse form of the Dyson equation for the electron propagator leads to a strategy for obtaining electron binding energies and Dyson orbitals that generalizes the Hartree-Fock equations through the introduction of the self-energy operator. All relaxation and correlation effects reside in this operator, which has an energy-dependent, nonlocal form that is systematically improvable. Perturbative arguments produce several, convenient (e.g. partial third order, outer valence Green's function, and second-order, transition-operator) approximations for the evaluation of valence ionization energies, electron affinities, and core ionization energies. Renormalized approaches based on Hartree-Fock or approximate Brueckner orbitals are employed when correlation effects become qualitatively important. Reference-state total energies based on contour integrals in the complex plane and gradients of electron binding energies enable exploration of final-state potential energy surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A new benchmark study has been performed for six isomers of C20 and four isomers of C24 using explicitly correlated methods, together with coupled cluster theory with large basis sets and DFT with advanced functionals. The relative energy trends obtained are extremely sensitive to the methods used. Combining our best CCSD(T)-MP2 difference with our best MP2 basis set limit, the dehydrocorannulene bowl is found to be the most stable for C20, followed by the cage at about 8 kcal/mol, and the ring at about 46 kcal/mol. For C24, the D3d cage is found to be the most stable isomer, followed at only a few kilocalories per mole by dehydrocoronene, and at larger separations by then octahedral cage and the ring, respectively. This makes C24 the smallest classical fullerene. The estimated residual basis set error of the estimated CCSD(T) basis set limit is conservatively expected to be ±1 kcal/mol. In general, DFT exhibits large errors for relative energies with RMSD values in the 8-34 kcal/mol range. However, among the DFT functionals, the DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ double hybrid comes close to our best ab initio results, while the $\omega$B97X-V range-separated hybrid is in semiquantitative agreement.},

abstract = {Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) is one of the major spectroscopic tools to study peptides. Nevertheless, a full understanding of what determines the signs and intensities of VCD bands of these compounds in the amide I and amide II spectral regions is still far from complete. In the present work, we study the origin of these VCD signals using the general coupled oscillator (GCO) analysis, a novel approach that has recently been developed. We apply this approach to the ForValNHMe model peptide in both $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-sheet configurations. We show that the intense VCD signals observed in the amide I and amide II spectral regions essentially have the same underlying mechanism, namely, the through-space coupling of electric dipoles. The crucial role played by intramolecular hydrogen bonds in determining VCD intensities is also illustrated. Moreover, we find that the contributions to the rotational strengths, considered to be insignificant in standard VCD models, may have sizable magnitudes and can thus not always be neglected. In addition, the VCD robustness of the amide I and II modes has been investigated by monitoring the variation of the rotational strength and its contributing terms during linear transit scans and by performing calculations with different computational parameters. From these studies - and in particular, the decomposition of the rotational strength made possible by the GCO analysis - it becomes clear that one should be cautious when employing measures of robustness as proposed previously.},

The comparison is most straightforward for the time-ordered one-particle Green's function, and we show that the Green's function calculated by EOM-CC with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD) includes fewer ring diagrams at higher order than does the GW approximation, due to the former's unbalanced treatment of time-ordering. However, the EOM-CCSD Green's function contains a large number of vertex corrections, including ladder diagrams, mixed ring-ladder diagrams, and exchange diagrams. By including triple excitations, the EOM-CCSDT Green's function includes all diagrams contained in the GW approximation, along with many high-order vertex corrections. In the same language, we discuss a number of common approximations to the EOM-CCSD equations, many of which can be classified as elimination of diagrams. Finally, we present numerical results by calculating the principal charged excitations energies of the molecules contained in the so-called GW100 test set [ J. Chem.

CIS (D) excitation energies are size consistent and the calculational complexity scales with the fifth power of molecular size, akin to second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset theory for the ground state.

Although for the computation of excitonic optical spectra in an extended frequency range efficient methods are available, the determination and analysis of individual exciton states still requires the diagonalization of the electron-hole Hamiltonian H. We present a numerically efficient approach for the calculation of exciton states with quadratically scaling complexity, which significantly diminishes the computational costs compared to the commonly used cubically scaling direct-diagonalization schemes. The accuracy and performance of this approach is demonstrated by solving the BSE numerically for the Wannier-Mott two-band model in k space and the semiconductors MgO and InN. For the convergence with respect to the k -point sampling, a general trend is identified, which can be used to extrapolate converged results for the binding energies of the lowest bound states. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

It is based on a quadratic form that models the integrand of the coupling parameter, whose components are chosen to satisfy several well-known limiting conditions. Its integration leads to DHs containing a single parameter controlling the amount of exact exchange, which is determined by requiring it to depend on the weight of the MP2 correlation contribution. Two new parameter-free DHs functionals are derived in this way, by incorporating the non-empirical PBE and TPSS functionals in the underlying expression. Their extensive testing using the GMTKN30 benchmark indicates that they are in competition with state-of-the-art DHs, yet providing much better self-interaction errors and opening a new avenue towards the design of accurate double-hybrid exchange-correlation functionals departing from the AC integrand. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The MPn energies up to n = 30 are, in turn, obtained by the determinant-based method of Knowles et al. (Chem. Phys. Lett. 1985, 113, 8-12). The zeroth- through third-order electron binding energies thus determined agree with those obtained by solving the Dyson equation in the diagonal and frequency-independent approximations of the self-energy. However, as n → ∞, they converge at the exact basis-set solutions from the Dyson equation with the exact self-energy, which is nondiagonal and frequency-dependent. This suggests that the MPn energy differences define an alternative diagrammatic expansion of Koopmans-like electron binding energies, which takes into account the perturbation corrections from the off-diagonal elements and frequency dependence of the irreducible self-energy. Our analysis shows that these corrections are included as semireducible and linked-disconnected diagrams, respectively, which are also found in a perturbation expansion of the electron binding energies of the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster methods. The rate of convergence of the electron binding energies with respect to n and its acceleration by Pad{\'{e}} approximants are also discussed.},

abstract = {The correlation part of the pair density is separated into two components, one of them being predominant at short electronic ranges and the other at long ranges. The analysis of the intracular part of these components permits to classify molecular systems according to the prevailing correlation: dynamic or nondynamic. The study of the long-range asymptotics reveals the key component of the pair density that is responsible for the description of London dispersion forces and a universal decay with the interelectronic distance. The natural range-separation, the identification of the dispersion forces, and the kind of predominant correlation type that arise from this analysis are expected to be important assets in the development of new electronic structure methods in wave function, density, and reduced density-matrix functional theories. E lectron correlation being the Holy Grail of electronic structure methods, it has been the subject of extended analysis. 1−14 The solution of quantum many-body problems hinges on the type of correlation present in the system, and one of the most practical classifications consists in the separation between dynamic-and nondynamic-correlation-including methods. Indeed, there are accurate methods to study systems with one predominant correlation type, but systems presenting both correlation types pose one of the greatest current challenges in electronic structure theory. 15−17 The attempt at taking the best of both worlds has led to a resurgence of interest in hybrid schemes, 18 merging methods that recover different correlation types. 19−21 Among hybrid implementations, the most successful one is based on the range separation of electron correlation, 18,22,23 using a mixing function to combine approximations that account for short-range dynamic correlationsuch as density functional approximationswith approaches providing correct long-range asymptotics. The performance of these methods pivots on the choice of the function combining the two approaches, which provides a natural splitting of the Coulomb interaction and thus the pair density. 24 In range-separation approximations , the typical choice is the error function that, in turn, depends on an attenuating parameter, which is both system-and property-dependent. 25,26 Even though the methods are chosen according to their ability of recovering dynamic and nondynamic correlation, the range separation of the pair density has not been motivated by the correlation type present in the system, risking double counting of electron correlation. Thus far, there has been very few attempts to separate dynamic and nondynamic correlation, 2,4−9,13,27 most of them based on energy calculations. The lack of a physically sound separation of dynamic and nondynamic correlation precludes individual treatment of these effects. We analyze the decomposition of the pair density into three components: the uncorrelated reference and two correlation terms. The latter two behave differently with respect to large changes of the first-order reduced density matrix (1-RDM), permitting the identification of systems with prevalent dynamic or non-dynamic correlation. 2,6,7,11,12 Some of us have recently used a similar strategy to obtain scalar 11 and local 12 measures of dynamic and nondynamic electron correlation from a two-electron model. The intracule of the correlation components of the pair density yields a 2-fold separation of the Coulomb hole in terms of correlation type and interelectronic range. These components of the pair density display a simpler mathematical form than the total pair density, one of them being dominant at short ranges and one with prevailing long-range contributions. This feature is particularly convenient for the design of energy functionals in wave function, density, and density matrix functional theories. As a result of this separation, we will clearly identify the part of the pair density that is responsible for the correct description of van der Waals interactions and unveil a universal condition it should satisfy. 28 To our knowledge, the},

This technique allows an efficient parallel implementation and application to systems with several hundreds of atoms. Various benchmark calculations are presented.

Comparisons with respect to other G0W0 implementations are reported for a set of molecules, while the performance of the method has been measured for water clusters containing up to 480 atoms in a cc-TZVP basis. Additionally, G0W0 has been applied for studying the influence of the ligands on the gap of small CdSe nanoparticles. evGW has been employed to calculate the HOMO-LUMO gaps of linear acenes, linear chains formed of connected benzene rings. Distinct differences between the closed and the open-shell (broken-symmetry) evGW HOMO-LUMO gaps for long acenes are found.

A single threshold defines the pair and triple specific virtual spaces completely and automatically. It is demonstrated that the computational cost of the method scales linearly with molecular size. Employing the recommended threshold a similar fraction of the correlation energy is recovered as with the original PAO method at a somewhat lower cost. A benchmark for 52 reactions demonstrates that for reaction energies the intrinsic accuracy of the coupled cluster with singles and doubles excitations and a perturbative treatment of triples excitations method can be reached by OSV-local coupled cluster theory with singles and doubles and perturbative triples, provided a MP2 correction is applied that accounts for basis set incompleteness errors as well as for remaining domain errors. As an application example the interaction energies of the guanine-cytosine dimers in the Watson-Crick and stacked arrangements are investigated at the level of local coupled cluster theory with singles and doubles and perturbative triples. Based on these calculations we propose new complete-basis-set-limit estimates for these interaction energies at this level of theory. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Institute of Physics},

The time-dependent formulation builds on the connection between time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory and the configuration-interaction with single substitution (CIS) method. This results in a time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger-like equation for the quasiparticle orbital dynamics based on an effective Hamiltonian containing direct Hartree and screened exchange terms, where screening is described within the random-phase approximation (RPA). To solve for the optical-absorption spectrum, we develop a stochastic formulation in which the quasiparticle orbitals are replaced by stochastic orbitals to evaluate the direct and exchange terms in the Hamiltonian as well as the RPA screening. This leads to an overall quadratic scaling, a significant improvement over the equivalent symplectic eigenvalue representation of the BSE. Application of the time-dependent stochastic BSE (TDsBSE) approach to silicon and CdSe nanocrystals up to size of ≈3000 electrons is presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Double-hybrid density functionals are based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange and correlation with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional (dubbed B2PLYP) contains only two empirical parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (ax) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (ac), respectively. Extensive testing has recently demonstrated the outstanding accuracy of this approach for various ground state problems in general chemistry applications. The method is extended here without any further empirical adjustments to electronically excited states in the framework of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) or the closely related Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA-DFT). In complete analogy to the ground state treatment, a scaled second-order perturbation correction to configuration interaction with singles (CIS(D)) wave functions developed some years ago by Head-Gordon et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 219, 21 (1994)] is computed on the basis of density functional data and added to the TD(A)-DFTGGA excitation energy. The method is implemented by applying the resolution of the identity approximation and the efficiency of the code is discussed. Extensive tests for a wide variety of molecules and excited states (of singlet, triplet, and doublet multiplicities) including electronic spectra are presented. In general, rather accurate excitation energies (deviations from reference data typically {\textless}0.2 eV) are obtained that are mostly better than those from standard functionals. Still, systematic errors are obtained for Rydberg (too low on average by about 0.3 eV) and charge-transfer transitions but due to the relatively large ax parameter (0.53), B2PLYP outperforms most other functionals in this respect. Compared to conventional HF-based CIS(D), the method is more robust in electronically complex situations due to the implicit account of static correlation effects by the GGA parts. The (D) correction often works in the right direction and compensates for the overestimation of the transition energy at the TD level due to the elevated fraction of HF exchange in the hybrid GGA part. Finally, the limitations of the method are discussed for challenging systems such as transition metal complexes, cyanine dyes, and multireference cases.},

Here, we describe new compounds that bind aqueous CB[7] equally well, validating our prior suggestion that they, too, would be ultrahigh affinity CB[7]  guests. The present guests, which are based upon either a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane or adamantane core, have no metal atoms, so these results also confirm that the remarkably high affinities of the ferrocene-based guest need not be attributed to metal-specific interactions. Because we used the M2 method to compute the affinities of several of the new host-guest systems prior to synthesizing them, the present results also provide for the first blinded evaluation of this computational method. The blinded calculations agree reasonably well with experiment and successfully reproduce the observation that the new adamantane-based guests achieve extremely high affinities, despite the fact that they position a cationic substituent at only one electronegative portal of the CB[7]  host. However, there are also significant deviations from experiment, and these lead to the correction of a procedural error and an instructive evaluation of the sensitivity of the calculations to physically reasonable variations in molecular energy parameters. The new experimental and computational results presented here bear on the physical mechanisms of molecular recognition, the accuracy of the M2 method, and the usefulness of host-guest systems as test-beds for computational methods. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Vertical excitation energies and one-electron properties are computed for the valence excited states of these molecules using both multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory, CASPT2, and a hierarchy of coupled cluster methods, CC2, CCSD, and CC3. The calculations are done at identical geometries (MP26-31 G*) and with the same basis set (TZVP). In most cases, the CC3 results are very close to the CASPT2 results, whereas there are larger deviations with CC2 and CCSD, especially in singlet excited states that are not dominated by single excitations. Statistical evaluations of the calculated vertical excitation energies for 223 states are presented and discussed in order to assess the relative merits of the applied methods. CC2 reproduces the CC3 reference data for the singlets better than CCSD.

abstract = {The method of superposition of configurations, which provides a general solution of the quantum-mechanical many-particle problem (for fermions), is reformulated so that equations may be compared with those used in the Brueckner theory. Important differences occur in application to finite or nonuniform systems for which the Hartree-Fock or Brueckner self-consistent orbitals are not plane waves. In such cases nonvanishing single-particle matrix elements occur which cannot be described by the Brueckner formalism based on a two-particle operator. Equations for an effective two-particle operator, equivalent to the variational equations of the method of superposition of configurations, are derived for a basis of Hartree-Fock orbitals. At the expense of making the orbital basis dependent upon the effective two-particle operator, the orbital basis can be determined by a condition which is essentially that of the Brueckner method. This condition removes a class of matrix elements which do not necessarily vanish in the Hartree-Fock basis although they would be neglected to second order in a perturbation calculation starting from the Hartree-Fock wave function. The equations for the effective two-particle operator are formally the same in both cases but lead to different operators because of the different choice of basis. In neither case can the equations be written in terms of products of such operators, a formalism assumed in the Brueckner theory. It is shown that the Brueckner condition is not equivalent to the condition which would determine the best possible orbital basis for the form of wave function implied by the use of an effective operator dependent on two particles only. The argument of the present paper is limited to systems with a finite number of particles, since the variational principle used here is not applicable without modification to systems with an infinite number of particles.},

abstract = {A recently proposed new family of density functionals [S. Grimme, J. Chem. Phys. 124, 34108 (2006)] adds a fraction of nonlocal correlation as a new ingredient to density functional theory (DFT). This fractional correlation energy is calculated at the level of second-order many-body perturbation theory (PT2) and replaces some of the semilocal DFT correlation of standard hybrid DFT methods. The new "double hybrid" functionals (termed, e.g., B2-PLYP) contain only two empirical parameters that have been adjusted in thermochemical calculations on parts of the G2/3 benchmark set. The methods have provided the lowest errors ever obtained by any DFT method for the full G3 set of molecules. In this work, the applicability of the new functionals is extended to the exploration of potential energy surfaces with analytic gradients. The theory of the analytic gradient largely follows the standard theory of PT2 gradients with some additional subtleties due to the presence of the exchange-correlation terms in the self-consistent field operator. An implementation is reported for closed-shell as well as spin-unrestricted reference determinants. Furthermore, the implementation includes external point charge fields and also accommodates continuum solvation models at the level of the conductor like screening model. The density fitting resolution of the identity (RI) approximation can be applied to the evaluation of the PT2 part with large gains in computational efficiency. For systems with approximately 500-600 basis functions the evaluation of the double hybrid gradient is approximately four times more expensive than the calculation of the standard hybrid DFT gradient. Extensive test calculations are provided for main group elements and transition metal containing species. The results reveal that the B2-PLYP functional provides excellent molecular geometries that are superior compared to those from standard DFT and MP2.},

abstract = {The orbital-dependent correlation energy functional resulting from second order Kohn-Sham perturbation theory leads to atomic correlation potentials with correct shell structure and asymptotic behavior. The absolute magnitude of the exact correlation potential, however, is greatly overestimated. In addition, this functional is variationally instable, which shows up for systems with nearly degenerate highest occupied and lowest unoccupied levels like Be. In this contribution we examine the simplest resummation of the Kohn-Sham perturbation series which has the potential to resolve both the inaccuracy and the instability problem of the second order expression. This resummation includes only the hole-hole terms of the Epstein-Nesbet series of diagrams, which has the advantage that the resulting functional is computationally as efficient as the pure second order expression. The hole-hole Epstein-Nesbet functional is tested for a number of atoms and ions. It is found to reproduce correlation and ground state energies with an accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art generalized gradient approximations. The correlation potential, on the other hand, is dramatically improved compared to that obtained from generalized gradient approximations. The same applies to all quantities directly related to the potential, as, for instance, Kohn-Sham eigenvalues and excitation energies. Most importantly, however, the hole-hole Epstein-Nesbet functional turned out to be variationally stable for all neutral as well as all singly and doubly ionized atoms considered so far, including the case of Be. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

Our results underline that small $\Delta$EST values and sizable spin-orbit coupling matrix elements have to be simultaneously realized in order to facilitate UISC and ultimately TADF. Importantly, the spatial separation of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the emitter, a widely accepted strategy for the design of TADF molecules, does not necessarily lead to a sufficient reduction in $\Delta$EST; in fact, either a significant charge-transfer (CT) contribution to the T1 state or a minimal energy difference between the local-excitation and charge-transfer triplet states is required to achieve a small $\Delta$EST. Also, having S1 and T1 states of a different nature is found to strongly enhance spin-orbit coupling, which is consistent with the El-Sayed rule for ISC rates. Overall, our results indicate that having either similar energies for the local-excitation and charge-transfer triplet states or the right balance between a substantial CT contribution to T1 and somewhat different natures of the S1 and T1 states, paves the way toward UISC enhancement and thus TADF efficiency improvement.},

abstract = {We investigate the usefulness of a frozen-density embedding scheme within density-functional theory [J. Phys. Chem. 97, 8050 (1993)] for the calculation of solvatochromic shifts. The frozen-density calculations, particularly of excitation energies have two clear advantages over the standard supermolecule calculations: (i) calculations for much larger systems are feasible, since the time-consuming time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) part is carried out in a limited molecular orbital space, while the effect of the surroundings is still included at a quantum mechanical level. This allows a large number of solvent molecules to be included and thus affords both specific and nonspecific solvent effects to be modeled. (ii) Only excitations of the system of interest, i.e., the selected embedded system, are calculated. This allows an easy analysis and interpretation of the results. In TDDFT calculations, it avoids unphysical results introduced by spurious mixings with the artificially too low charge-transfer excitations which are an artifact of the adiabatic local-density approximation or generalized gradient approximation exchange-correlation kernels currently used. The performance of the frozen-density embedding method is tested for the well-studied solvatochromic properties of the n→$\pi$ * excitation of acetone. Further enhancement of the efficiency is studied by constructing approximate solvent densities, e.g., from a superposition of densities of individual solvent molecules. This is demonstrated for systems with up to 802 atoms. To obtain a realistic modeling of the absorption spectra of solvated molecules, including the effect of the solvent motions, we combine the embedding scheme with classical molecular dynamics (MD) and Car-Parrinello MD simulations to obtain snapshots of the solute and its solvent environment, for which then excitation energies are calculated. The frozen-density embedding yields estimated solvent shifts in the range of 0.20-0.26 eV, in good agreement with experimental values of between 0.19 and 0.21 eV.},

Although the auxiliary basis is determined from the energy expression, we have complete control of the errors in the gradient or Fock matrix. Another important advantage of this method specific Cholesky decomposition is that the exchange energy and Fock matrix can be evaluated with a linear scaling effort contrary to the RI method or standard Cholesky decomposition of the two-electron integral matrix. The methods presented show the same scaling properties as the so-called local density fitting methods, but with full error control.},

Herein, we provide a more in-depth analysis of OO-DHDFs with the main focus being on main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions. We reanalyze two PBE-based OO-DHDFs and present four new OO-DHDF variants, two of which make use of the spin-component-scaling idea in their nonlocal correlation part. We also provide a more thorough analysis of three OO-MP2 variants. After assessing more than 621 reference points, we come to the conclusion that the benefits of OO are not as straightforward as previously thought.

Provided an ansatz of a many-electron theory model, TCE performs valid contractions of creation and annihilation operators according to Wick's theorem, consolidates identical terms, and reduces the expressions into the form of multiple tensor contractions acted upon by permutation operators. It subsequently determines the binary contraction order for each multiple tensor contraction with the minimal operation and memory cost, factorizes common binary contractions (defines intermediate tensors), and identifies reusable intermediates. The resulting ordered list of binary tensor contractions, additions, and index permutations is translated into an optimized program that is combined with the NWCHEM and UTCHEM computational chemistry software packages. The programs synthesized by TCE take advantage of spin symmetry (within the spin−orbital formalisms), real Abelian point-group symmetry, and index permutation symmetry at every stage of the calculations to minimize the number of arithmetic operations and storage requirement, adjust the peak local memory usage by index-range tiling, and support parallel I/O interfaces and dynamic load balancing for parallel executions. We demonstrate the utility of TCE through automatic derivation and implementation of parallel programs for a range of predictive computational methodsconfiguration-interaction theory (CISD, CISDT, CISDTQ), generalized many-body perturbation theory [MBPT(2), MBPT(3), MBPT(4)], and coupled-cluster theory (LCCD, CCD, LCCSD, CCSD, QCISD, CCSDT, and CCSDTQ), some for the first timeand discuss the performance of the implemented programs.},

Moreover, some existing databases such as S22×5 are extended to shorter intermolecular separations. This improved DFT-D3 training set provides a balanced description of distances, covers the entire range of interaction types, and at 1526 data points is far larger than the original training set of 130. The results are validated against a new collection of 6773 data points and demonstrate that the effect of refitting the damping parameters ranges from no change in accuracy (LC-$\omega$PBE-D3) to an almost 2-fold decrease in average error (PBE-D3).},

abstract = {We establish a formal connection between the particle-particle (pp) random phase approximation (RPA) and the ladder channel of the coupled cluster doubles (CCD) equations. The relationship between RPA and CCD is best understood within a Bogoliubov quasiparticle (qp) RPA formalism. This work is a follow-up to our previous formal proof on the connection between particle-hole (ph) RPA and ring-CCD. Whereas RPA is a quasibosonic approximation, CC theory is a "correct bosonization" in the sense that the wavefunction and Hilbert space are exactly fermionic, yet the amplitude equations can be interpreted as adding different quasibosonic RPA channels together. Coupled cluster theory achieves this goal by interacting the ph (ring) and pp (ladder) diagrams via a third channel that we here call "crossed-ring" whose presence allows for full fermionic antisymmetry. Additionally, coupled cluster incorporates what we call "mosaic" terms which can be absorbed into defining a new effective one-body Hamiltonian. The inclusion of these mosaic terms seems to be quite important. The pp-RPA and qp-RPA equations are textbook material in nuclear structure physics but are largely unknown in quantum chemistry, where particle number fluctuations and Bogoliubov determinants are rarely used. We believe that the ideas and connections discussed in this paper may help design improved ways of incorporating RPA correlation into density functionals based on a CC perspective. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Perturbation theory using self-consistent Green's functions is one of the most widely used approaches to study many-body effects in condensed matter. On the basis of general considerations and by performing analytical calculations for the specific example of the Hubbard atom, we discuss some key features of this approach. We show that when the domain of the functionals that are used to realize the map between the noninteracting and the interacting Green's functions is properly defined, there exists a class of self-energy functionals for which the self-consistent Dyson equation has only one solution, which is the physical one. We also show that manipulation of the perturbative expansion of the interacting Green's function may lead to a wrong self-energy as a functional of the interacting Green's function, at least for some regions of the parameter space. These findings confirm and explain numerical results of Kozik et al. for the widely used skeleton series of Luttinger and Ward [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 156402 (2015)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.114.156402]. Our study shows that it is important to distinguish between the maps between sets of functions and the functionals that realize those maps. We demonstrate that the self-consistent Green's functions approach itself is not problematic, whereas the functionals that are widely used may have a limited range of validity.},

abstract = {The GW approximation is considered to be the simplest approximation within Hedin's formulation of many-body perturbation theory. It is expected that some of the deficiencies of the GW approximation can be overcome by adding the so-called vertex corrections. In this work, the recently implemented G0W0$\Gamma$0(1) scheme, which incorporates the vertex effects by adding the full second-order self-energy correction to the GW self-energy, is applied to a set of first-row transition-metal monoxide (TMO) anions. Benchmark calculations show that results obtained by G0W0$\Gamma$0(1) on top of the B3LYP hybrid functional starting point (SP) are in good agreement with experiment data, giving a mean absolute error of 0.13 eV for a testset comprising the ionization energies (IEs) of 27 outer valence molecular orbitals (MOs) from nine TMO anions. A systematic SP-dependence investigation by varying the ratio of the exact exchange (EXX) component in the PBE0-type SP reveals that, for G0W0$\Gamma$0(1), the best accuracy is achieved with 20{\%} EXX. Further error analysis in terms of the orbital symmetry characteristics (i.e., $\sigma$, $\pi$, or $\delta$) in the testset indicates the best amount of EXX in the SP for G0W0$\Gamma$0(1) calculations is independent of MO types, and this is in contrast with the situation in G0W0 calculations, where the best EXX ratio varies for different classes of MOs. Despite its success in describing the absolute IE values, we, however, found that G0W0$\Gamma$0(1) faces difficulties in describing the energy separations between certain states of interest, worsening the already underestimated G0W0 predictions.},

We inspect the same set of molecules using the projector augmented wave method and the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). For the ionization potential, the basis set extrapolated plane wave results agree very well with the Gaussian basis sets, often reaching better than 50 meV agreement. In order to achieve this agreement, we correct for finite basis set errors as well as errors introduced by periodically repeated images. For positive electron affinities differences between Gaussian basis sets and VASP are slightly larger. We attribute this to larger basis set extrapolation errors for the Gaussian basis sets. For quasi particle (QP) resonances above the vacuum level, differences between VASP and Gaussian basis sets are, however, found to be substantial. This is tentatively explained by insufficient basis set convergence of the Gaussian type orbital calculations as exemplified for selected test cases.},

The new strategy gives both localized occupied and localized virtual orbital spaces. The locality of the occupied orbital space is similar to one obtained using standard localization schemes. For the virtual space, standard localization schemes fail to give local orbitals while the new strategy gives a virtual space which has a locality similar to the one of a Lowdin orthonormalization of the atomic orbital basis. Since Lowdin orthonormalization gives the most local orthonormal basis functions in the sense that they have the largest similarity with the local atomic basis functions, the new strategy thus allows the orthonormal basis to become optimized without introducing significant delocalization.},

abstract = {The single particle energies obtained in a Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculation are generally known to be poor approximations to electron excitation energies that are measured in transport, tunneling and spectroscopic experiments such as photo-emission spectroscopy. The correction to these energies can be obtained from the poles of a single particle Green's function derived from a many-body perturbation theory. From a computational perspective, the accuracy and efficiency of such an approach depends on how a self energy term that properly accounts for dynamic screening of electrons is approximated. The G0W0 approximation is a widely used technique in which the self energy is expressed as the convolution of a noninteracting Green's function (G0) and a screened Coulomb interaction (W0) in the frequency domain. The computational cost associated with such a convolution is high due to the high complexity of evaluating W0 at multiple frequencies. In this paper, we discuss how the cost of G0W0 calculation can be reduced by constructing a low rank approximation to the frequency dependent part of W0. In particular, we examine the effect of such a low rank approximation on the accuracy of the G0W0 approximation. We also discuss how the numerical convolution of G0 and W0 can be evaluated efficiently and accurately by using a contour deformation technique with an appropriate choice of the contour.},

The EXX kernel is defined from first-order perturbation theory and used in the Dyson equation of time-dependent density-functional theory. Within this approximation (RPAx), the correlation energies of the HEG are significantly improved with respect to the random phase approximation (RPA) up to densities of the order of rs≈10. However, beyond this value, the RPAx response function exhibits an unphysical divergence and the approximation breaks down. Total energies of molecules at equilibrium are also highly accurate, but we find a similar instability at stretched geometries. Staying within an exact first-order approximation to the response function, we use an alternative resummation of the higher-order terms. This slight redefinition of RPAx fixes the instability in total energy calculations without compromising the overall accuracy of the approach.},

abstract = {Bulk properties of the isostructural oxides MgO, NiO, and CoO have been calculated quantum chemically with periodic models and compared with experimental data from the literature. Ab initio Hartree-Fock, gradient-corrected density-functional methods, and hybrid approaches have been used for the calculation of the lattice constants, heats of atomization, and electronic structures. General trends of the effects of electron correlation and the treatment of exchange on the calculated properties are observed. None of the standard methods considered provided results in agreement with experimental data for all properties. A combination of Becke's three-parameter exchange functional and the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) leads to a consistent description of the electronic and structural properties in comparative studies of the three compounds. Other methods are more accurate than B3LYP if certain properties or compounds are considered. The combination of the Hartree-Fock exchange functional with the Lee-Yang-Parr density-functional correlation is the best method for the open-shell transition-metal oxides NiO and CoO in terms of relative stability and geometry and the electronic structure of the valence band. The absolute values of calculated heats of atomization, however, are generally too small. The density-functional method based on the Perdew-Wang generalized gradient approximation (PWGGA) is preferable for the calculation of thermodynamic properties for all compounds but is less reliable in the prediction of structural and electronic properties. A hybrid approach based on the PWGGA method is proposed that improves the results for bulk geometries and electronic properties while maintaining the high quality of calculated energetic results. {\textcopyright}2000 The American Physical Society.},

We compare results from the fully self-consistent GW approximation (SCGW) and the quasiparticle self-consistent GW approximation (QSGW) within the same numerical framework. Core and valence electrons are treated on an equal footing in all the steps of the calculation. We use basis sets of localized functions to handle the space dependence of quantities and spectral functions to deal with their frequency dependence. We compare SCGW and QSGW on a qualitative level by comparing the computed densities of states (DOS). To judge their relative merit on a quantitative level, we compare their vertical ionization potentials (IPs) with those obtained from coupled-cluster calculations CCSD(T). Our results are futher compared with "one-shot" G0W0 calculations starting from Hartree-Fock solutions (G0W0-HF). Both self-consistent GW approaches behave quite similarly. Averaging over all the studied molecules, both methods show only a small improvement (somewhat larger for SCGW) of the calculated IPs with respect to G0W0-HF results. Interestingly, SCGW and QSGW calculations tend to deviate in opposite directions with respect to CCSD(T) results. SCGW systematically underestimates the IPs, while QSGW tends to overestimate them. G0W0-HF produces results which are surprisingly close to QSGW calculations both for the DOS and for the numerical values of the IPs. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

Controversies often exist in experimental data interpretation. We report here a first principles study on binding energy of carbon 1s orbital in GO. The calculated results can be well used to interpret experimental x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data and provide a unified spectral assignment. Based on the first principles understanding of XPS, a GO structure model containing new oxidation species epoxy pair and epoxy-hydroxy pair is proposed.

abstract = {The GW approximation to many-body perturbation theory is a reliable tool for describing charged electronic excitations, and it has been successfully applied to a wide range of extended systems for several decades using a plane-wave basis. However, the GW approximation has been used to test limited spectral properties of a limited set of finite systems (e.g., frontier orbital energies of closed-shell sp molecules) only for about a decade using a local-orbital basis. Here, we calculate the quasiparticle spectra of closed- and open-shell molecular anions with partially and completely filled 3d shells (shallow and deep 3d states, respectively), ScO-, TiO-, CuO-, and ZnO-, using various levels of GW theory, and compare them to experiments to evaluate the performance of the GW approximation on the electronic structure of small molecules containing 3d transition metals. We find that the G-only eigenvalue self-consistent GW scheme with W fixed to the PBE level (GnW0@PBE), which gives the best compromise between accuracy and efficiency for solids, also gives good results for both localized (d) and delocalized (sp) states of 3d-transition-metal oxide molecules. The success of GnW0@PBE in predicting electronic excitations in these systems reasonably well is likely due to the fortuitous cancellation effect between the overscreening of the Coulomb interaction by PBE and the underscreening by the neglect of vertex corrections. Together with the absence of the self-consistent field convergence error (e.g., spin contamination in open-shell systems) and the GW multisolution issue, the GnW0@PBE scheme gives the possibility to predict the electronic structure of complex real systems (e.g., molecule-solid and sp-d hybrid systems) accurately and efficiently.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. In this study, we explore the effect of supplementing the DuT spin-component-scaled double-hybrid density functional method with post-second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset-type theory (MP2) correlation terms. We find that the inclusion of additional MP3 correlation energies has almost no effect on the performance. Further addition of correlation effects from MP4 generally leads to a small improvement in the performance. However, we find that the inclusion of the higher-order perturbative correlation effects does not rectify some major shortcomings of DuT for more challenging systems, and the use of MP4, in fact, leads to a significant deterioration in the performance in some cases. We also find that the use of correlation energies from CCSD(T) instead of those from MP3 and MP4 does not lead to a substantial improvement over the MP4-based method, both in general and in some difficult cases that we have examined. An additional observation is that, for large systems that are dominated by noncovalent interactions, DuT and the two MPn-based post-MP2 double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) procedures all benefit from the inclusion of dispersion corrections. Overall, our investigation suggests that the current generation of MP2-based double-hybrid DFT methods may already be providing close to the optimal performance that can be achieved with the double-hybrid methodology paired with spin-component-scaling. Development of even better double hybrids is an active research field, and we hope that our study provides valuable insights. We recommend the continuing use of existing MP2-based double-hybrid methods as a bridging level between hybrid density functional procedures and high-level wave-function-based procedures.},

abstract = {The random phase approximation (RPA) to the density functional correlation energy systematically improves upon many limitations of present semilocal functionals, but was considered too computationally expensive for widespread use in the past. Here a physically appealing reformulation of the RPA correlation model is developed that substantially reduces its computational complexity. The density functional RPA correlation energy is shown to equal one-half times the difference of all RPA electronic excitation energies computed at full and first order coupling. Thus, the RPA correlation energy may be considered as a difference of electronic zero point vibrational energies, where each eigenmode corresponds to an electronic excitation. This surprisingly simple result is intimately related to plasma theories of electron correlation. Differences to electron pair correlation models underlying popular correlated wave function methods are discussed. The RPA correlation energy is further transformed into an explicit functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. The only nontrivial ingredient to this functional is the sign function of the response operator. A stable iterative algorithm to evaluate this sign function based on the Newton-Schulz iteration is presented. Integral direct implementations scale as the fifth power of the system size, similar to second order M{\o}ller-Plesset calculations. With these improvements, RPA may become the long-sought robust and efficient zero order post-Kohn-Sham correlation model. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We describe a fast parallel iterative method for computing molecular absorption spectra within TDDFT linear response and using the LCAO method. We use a local basis of "dominant products" to parametrize the space of orbital products that occur in the LCAO approach. In this basis, the dynamic polarizability is computed iteratively within an appropriate Krylov subspace. The iterative procedure uses a matrix-free GMRES method to determine the (interacting) density response. The resulting code is about 1 order of magnitude faster than our previous full-matrix method. This acceleration makes the speed of our TDDFT code comparable with codes based on Casidas equation. The implementation of our method uses hybrid MPI and OpenMP parallelization in which load balancing and memory access are optimized. To validate our approach and to establish benchmarks, we compute spectra of large molecules on various types of parallel machines. The methods developed here are fairly general, and we believe they will find useful applications in molecular physics/chemistry, even for problems that are beyond TDDFT, such as organic semiconductors, particularly in photovoltaics. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

For scGW0 and G0W0 the deviation from CCSD(T) is strongly dependent on the starting point. We further relate the discrepancy between the GW ionization energies and CCSD(T) to the deviation from straight line error (DSLE). In DSLE-minimized GW calculations, the DSLE is significantly reduced, yielding a systematic improvement in the description of the ionization energies.},

The corrections can be readily extracted from electron correlation calculations of clusters with almost no additional effort. Benchmark calculations show that the improved CIM approach can recover more than 99.94{\%} of the correlation energy calculated by the parent method.

abstract = {Two new split-valence basis sets, termed 6-21G and 3-21G, are proposed for use in molecular orbital calculations on molecules containing first-row elements. The valence functions for the smaller representation (3-21G) have been taken directly from the larger (6-21G), preventing their collapse inwards to make up for deficiencies in the inner-shell region. This is necessary to ensure a good description of bonding interactions which necessarily involve overlap of valence functions. Equilibrium geometries, vibrational frequencies, relative energies, and electric dipole moments calculated using the 3-21 G basis set are nearly identical with those obtained from the larger 6-21G representation. Compared to experiment they are consistently superior to properties derived from the STO-3G minimal basis set, and of comparable quality to those obtained from the larger 4-2 IC and 4-3 IG representations, One notable exception is that the 4-3 1G basis set yields hydrogenation energies in significantly better agreement with experiment than those obtained from 3-21G. The 3-21G basis set comprises the same number of primitive Gaussian functions as STO-3G (although nearly twice the number of basis functions) and should be nearly as efficient computationally as that representation for applications which require evaluation of energy derivatives as well as the energy itself (e.g., determination of equilibrium geometry and calculation of vibrational frequencies). It is less costly to apply than either the 4-21G or 4-3 IC split-valence basis sets, and in those areas where the performance of the two is comparable it would appear to be the method of choice.},

In this work, we describe the integration of the ChASE library, a modern parallel eigensolver, into an existing legacy code for the first-principles computation of optical properties of materials via solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the optical polarization function. Our numerical tests show that, as a result of integrating ChASE and parallelizing the reading routine, the code experiences a remarkable speedup and greatly improved scaling behavior on both multi- and many-core architectures. We demonstrate that such a modernized BSE code will, by fully exploiting parallel computing architectures and file systems, enable domain scientists to accurately study complex material systems that were not accessible before.},

A procedure for generating diffuse functions to be added to standard Slater-type orbital basis sets for H to Kr is proposed and tested on ten close-shell molecules. The database for comparing the performance of standard and augmented basis sets consists of the 15 lowest transitions to valence and Rydberg-like states for each of the molecules. The results of this computational study are very encouraging. The addition of new augmenting functions improves the performance of standard basis sets significantly. For example, the new augmented TZP basis set, about the same size as the standard TZ2P set (and considerably smaller than the large QZ4P set), led to an average absolute deviation of 150 predicted excitation energies of only 0.12eV from those obtained with the very large basis set called QZ3P-3DIFFUSE, compared to 0.83, 0.79, and 0.19eV, for the standard TZP, TZ2P, and QZ4P sets, respectively.

By formulating the algorithm in Legendre coefficient space, our method inherits the known faster-than-exponential convergence of the Green's function's Legendre series expansion. In this basis, the fast recursive method for Legendre polynomial convolution enables us to develop a Dyson equation solver with quadratic scaling.

The primary reactions lead to minor amounts of the molecular radical anions of the halomethanes in addition to CH2SCl- and Cl-, which are formed as the major product ions. The initial step is suggested to be electron transfer with formation of a [CH2S + CXCl3{\textperiodcentered}-] ion/molecule complex, which may dissociate to the radical anion of the halomethane or react further to yield a [CH2S + Cl- + CXCl2{\textperiodcentered}-] complex prior to the generation of the Cl- or CH2SCl- ions. The radical anions of CHCl3 and CCl4 react with the parent compounds to yield CHCl4- and CCl5- ions, respectively, whereas CFCl3{\textperiodcentered}- transfer a Cl- ion only to the CH3SH molecules also present in the FT-ICR cell. On the basis of the facile occurrence of Cl- transfer, the CXCl3{\textperiodcentered}- ions are proposed to exist in a structure which can be described as a chloride ion weakly bonded to a CXCl2{\textperiodcentered} radical. The formation of the CXCl3{\textperiodcentered}- ions in the reaction with the CH2S{\textperiodcentered}- radical anion places a lower limit of 45 kJ mol-1 for the electron affinities of the CXCl3 molecules. The occurrence of Cl- transfer from the CHCl3{\textperiodcentered}- ion to the parent compound leads to an indicated upper limit of 75 kJ mol-1 for the electron affinity of chloroform. Similarly, the occurrence of Cl- transfer from the CCl4{\textperiodcentered}- ion to the parent compound is used to derive an upper limit of 110 kJ mol-1 for the electron affinity of tetrachloromethane. These upper limits suggest that previously reported values overestimate the electron affinities of chloroform and tetrachloromethane. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) results are mistrusted at times due to the presence of an unknown exchange correlation functional, with no practical way to guarantee convergence to the right answer. The use of a known exchange correlation functional based on wave-function theory helps to alleviate such mistrust. The exchange correlation functionals can be written exactly in terms of the density-density response function using the adiabatic-connection and fluctuation-dissipation framework. The random phase approximation (RPA) is the simplest approximation for the density-density response function. Since the correlation functional obtained from RPA is equivalent to the direct ring coupled cluster doubles (ring-CCD) correlation functional, meaning only Coulomb interactions are included, one can bracket RPA between many body perturbation theory (MBPT)-2 and CCD with the latter having all ring, ladder, and exchange contributions. Using an optimized effective potential strategy, we obtain correlation potentials corresponding to MBPT-2, RPA (ring-CCD), linear-CCD, and CCD. Using the suitable choice of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, Kohn-Sham self-consistent calculations are performed. The spatial behavior of the resulting potentials, total energies, and the HOMO eigenvalues are compared with the exact values for spherical atoms. Further, we demonstrate that the self-consistent eigenvalues obtained from these consistent potentials used in ab initio dft approximate all principal ionization potentials as demanded by ionization potential theorem. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

B 76, 165106 (2007)PRBMDO1098-012110.1103/PhysRevB.76.165106] for the electronic structure with the solution of the ladder approximation to the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the macroscopic dielectric function. The solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation has been implemented within an all-electron framework, using a linear muffin-tin orbital basis set, with the contribution from the nonlocal self-energy to the transition dipole moments (in the optical limit) evaluated explicitly. This approach addresses those systems whose electronic structure is poorly described within the standard perturbative GW approaches with density-functional theory calculations as a starting point. The merits of this approach have been exemplified by calculating optical absorption spectra of a strongly correlated transition metal oxide, NiO, and a narrow gap semiconductor, Ge. In both cases, the calculated spectrum is in good agreement with the experiment. It is also shown that for systems whose electronic structure is well-described within the standard perturbative GW, such as Si, LiF, and h-BN, the performance of the present approach is in general comparable to the standard GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation. It is argued that both vertex corrections to the electronic screening and the electron-phonon interaction are responsible for the observed systematic overestimation of the fundamental band gap and spectrum onset.},

abstract = {Electronic structure calculations, such as those employing Kohn–Sham density functional theory or ab initio wavefunction theories, have allowed for atomistic-level understandings of a wide variety of phenomena and properties of matter at small scales. However, the computational cost of electronic structure methods drastically increases with length and time scales, which makes these methods difficult for long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations or large-sized systems. Machine-learning techniques can provide accurate potentials that can match the quality of electronic structure calculations, provided sufficient training data. These potentials can then be used to rapidly simulate large and long time-scale phenomena at similar quality to the parent electronic structure approach. Machine-learning potentials usually take a bias-free mathematical form and can be readily developed for a wide variety of systems. Electronic structure calculations have favorable properties–namely that they are noiseless and targeted training data can be produced on-demand–that make them particularly well-suited for machine learning. This paper discusses our modular approach to atomistic machine learning through the development of the open-source Atomistic Machine-learning Package (Amp), which allows for representations of both the total and atom-centered potential energy surface, in both periodic and non-periodic systems. Potentials developed through the atom-centered approach are simultaneously applicable for systems with various sizes. Interpolation can be enhanced by introducing custom descriptors of the local environment. We demonstrate this in the current work for Gaussian-type, bispectrum, and Zernike-type descriptors. Amp has an intuitive and modular structure with an interface through the python scripting language yet has parallelizable fortran components for demanding tasks; it is designed to integrate closely with the widely used Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), which makes it compatible with a wide variety of commercial and open-source electronic structure codes. We finally demonstrate that the neural network model inside Amp can accurately interpolate electronic structure energies as well as forces of thousands of multi-species atomic systems.

abstract = {We introduce the new MOR41 benchmark set consisting of 41 closed-shell organometallic reactions resembling many important chemical transformations commonly used in transition metal chemistry and catalysis. It includes significantly larger molecules than presented in other transition metal test sets and covers a broad range of bonding motifs. Recent progress in linear-scaling coupled cluster theory allowed for the calculation of accurate DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS(def2-TZVPP/def2-QZVPP) reference energies for 3d,4d,5d-transition metal compounds with up to 120 atoms. Furthermore, 41 density functionals, including seven GGAs, three meta-GGAs, 14 hybrid functionals, and 17 double-hybrid functionals combined with two different London dispersion corrections, are benchmarked with respect to their performance for the newly compiled MOR41 reaction energies. A few wave function-based post-HF methods as, e.g., MP2 or RPA with similar computational demands are also tested and in total, 90 methods were considered. The double-hybrid functional PWPB95-D3(BJ) outperformed all other assessed methods with an MAD of 1.9 kcal/mol, followed by the hybrids $\omega$B97X-V (2.2 kcal/mol) and mPW1B95-D3(BJ) (2.4 kcal/mol). The popular PBE0-D3(BJ) hybrid also performs well (2.8 kcal/mol). Within the meta-GGA class, the recently published SCAN-D3(BJ) functional as well as TPSS-D3(BJ) perform best (MAD of 3.2 and 3.3 kcal/mol, respectively). Many popular methods like BP86-D3(BJ) (4.9 kcal/mol) or B3LYP-D3(BJ) (4.9 kcal/mol) provide significantly worse reaction energies and are not recommended for organometallic thermochemistry considering the availability of better methods with the same computational cost. The results regarding the performance of different functional approximations are consistent with conclusions from previous main-group thermochemistry benchmark studies.},

@article{Friedrich2010,
abstract = {We present an implementation of the GW approximation for the electronic self-energy within the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method. The algorithm uses an all-electron mixed product basis for the representation of response matrices and related quantities. This basis is derived from the FLAPW basis and is exact for wave-function products. The correlation part of the self-energy is calculated on the imaginary-frequency axis with a subsequent analytic continuation to the real axis. As an alternative we can perform the frequency convolution of the Green function G and the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction W explicitly by a contour integration. The singularity of the bare and screened interaction potentials gives rise to a numerically important self-energy contribution, which we treat analytically to achieve good convergence with respect to the k -point sampling. As numerical realizations of the GW approximation typically suffer from the high computational expense required for the evaluation of the nonlocal and frequency-dependent self-energy, we demonstrate how the algorithm can be made very efficient by exploiting spatial and time-reversal symmetry as well as by applying an optimization of the mixed product basis that retains only the numerically important contributions of the electron-electron interaction. This optimization step reduces the basis size without compromising the accuracy and accelerates the code considerably. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one can employ an extrapolar approximation for high-lying states to reduce the number of empty states that must be taken into account explicitly in the construction of the polarization function and the self-energy. We show convergence tests, CPU timings, and results for prototype semiconductors and insulators as well as ferromagnetic nickel. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We develop a systematic approach to construct energy functionals of the one-particle reduced density matrix (1RDM) for equilibrium systems at finite temperature. The starting point of our formulation is the grand potential $\Omega$[G] regarded as variational functional of the Green's function G based on diagrammatic many-body perturbation theory and for which we consider either the Klein or Luttinger–Ward form. By restricting the input Green's function to be one-to-one related to a set on one-particle reduced density matrices (1RDM) this functional becomes a functional of the 1RDM. To establish the one-to-one mapping we use that, at any finite temperature and for a given 1RDM $\gamma$ in a finite basis, there exists a non-interacting system with a spatially non-local potential v[$\gamma$] which reproduces the given 1RDM. The corresponding set of non-interacting Green's functions defines the variational domain of the functional $\Omega$. In the zero temperature limit we obtain an energy functional E[$\gamma$] which by minimisation yields an approximate ground state 1RDM and energy. As an application of the formalism we use the Klein and Luttinger–Ward functionals in the GW-approximation to compute the binding curve of a model hydrogen molecule using an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian. We compare further to the case in which we evaluate the functionals on a Hartree–Fock and a Kohn–Sham Green's function. We find that the Luttinger–Ward version of the functionals performs the best and is able to reproduce energies close to the GW energy which corresponds to the stationary point.},

abstract = {The least-squares tensor hypercontraction (LS-THC) representation for the electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor is presented. Recently, we developed the generic tensor hypercontraction (THC) ansatz, which represents the fourth-order ERI tensor as a product of five second-order tensors [E. G. Hohenstein, R. M. Parrish, and T. J. Martínez, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 044103 (2012)]. Our initial algorithm for the generation of the THC factors involved a two-sided invocation of overlap-metric density fitting, followed by a PARAFAC decomposition, and is denoted PARAFAC tensor hypercontraction (PF-THC). LS-THC supersedes PF-THC by producing the THC factors through a least-squares renormalization of a spatial quadrature over the otherwise singular 1∕r(12) operator. Remarkably, an analytical and simple formula for the LS-THC factors exists. Using this formula, the factors may be generated with O(N(5)) effort if exact integrals are decomposed, or O(N(4)) effort if the decomposition is applied to density-fitted integrals, using any choice of density fitting metric. The accuracy of LS-THC is explored for a range of systems using both conventional and density-fitted integrals in the context of MP2. The grid fitting error is found to be negligible even for extremely sparse spatial quadrature grids. For the case of density-fitted integrals, the additional error incurred by the grid fitting step is generally markedly smaller than the underlying Coulomb-metric density fitting error. The present results, coupled with our previously published factorizations of MP2 and MP3, provide an efficient, robust O(N(4)) approach to both methods. Moreover, LS-THC is generally applicable to many other methods in quantum chemistry.},

@article{Lowdin1970,
abstract = {This chapter discusses three orthonormalization procedures, such as successive orthonormalization, symmetric orthonormalization, and canonical orthonormalization. The simplest way of orthonormalizing a finite set of functions is by the classical Schmidt procedure, in which each member of the set in order is orthogonalized against all the previous members and subsequently normalized. In solid-state theory, one could probably construct orthonormal combinations of the atomic orbitals of the system, which would still preserve the natural symmetry. In such an approach, it would be necessary to treat the given functions ɸ = {\{}ɸ1, ɸ2{\ldots}., ɸn{\}} simultaneously, on an equivalent basis instead of successively as in the Schmidt procedure. In molecular and solid-state theory, there are cases when also the symmetric orthonormalization procedure will break down, depending on the fact that, even if the basis ɸ = {\{}ɸ1, ɸ2{\ldots}., ɸn{\}} is linearly independent from the mathematical point of view, it may be approximately linearly dependent from the computational point of view. This phenomenon causes a great many complications and may lead to very misleading results, since the associated secular equations may be almost identically vanishing. Unfortunately, it seems as if many of the conventionally used basic systems are strongly affected by approximate linear dependencies. In order to systematize this problem, it is convenient to study the metric matrix. {\textcopyright} 1970, Academic Press Inc.},

Our down-scaled SOSEX (dsSOSEX) and scaled equation SOSEX (seSOSEX) approaches deliver considerably more accurate noncovalent interaction energies, reaction energies, and barrier heights than the original SOSEX method. The dsSOSEX approach improves on the description of medium- and long-range correlation, for example, in isogyric processes, while the seSOSEX approach improves on the description of processes with short- and medium-range rearrangement in the electronic structure, such as atomization. The He2+ potential energy curve shows that the many-body self-correlation error is slightly smaller in the dsSOSEX method than in the seSOSEX approach. Furthermore, the H2 potential energy curve reveals that the static correlation error can also be reduced at medium range by the dsSOSEX and seSOSEX schemes. As our dsSOSEX method provides a better description of medium- and long-range correlation, it generally leads to more accurate energetics than the seSOSEX method; hence it should be preferred over the latter. We compare our results to other empirical and nonempirical direct random phase approximation (dRPA) and beyond-dRPA methods and also discuss the possibilities for further development.},

abstract = {A self-consistent Kohn-Sham (KS) method is presented that treats correlation on the basis of the adiabatic-connection dissipation-fluctuation theorem employing the direct random phase approximation (dRPA), i.e., taking into account only the Coulomb kernel while neglecting the exchange-correlation kernel in the calculation of the Kohn-Sham correlation energy and potential. The method, denoted self-consistent dRPA method, furthermore treats exactly the exchange energy and the local multiplicative KS exchange potential. It uses Gaussian basis sets, is reasonably efficient, exhibiting a scaling of the computational effort with the forth power of the system size, and thus is generally applicable to molecules. The resulting dRPA correlation potentials in contrast to common approximate correlation potentials are in good agreement with exact reference potentials. The negatives of the eigenvalues of the highest occupied molecular orbitals are found to be in good agreement with experimental ionization potentials. Total energies from self-consistent dRPA calculations, as expected, are even poorer than non-self-consistent dRPA total energies and dRPA reaction and non-covalent binding energies do not significantly benefit from self-consistency. On the other hand, energies obtained with a recently introduced adiabatic-connection dissipation-fluctuation approach (EXXRPA+, exact-exchange random phase approximation) that takes into account, besides the Coulomb kernel, also the exact frequency-dependent exchange kernel are significantly improved if evaluated with orbitals obtained from a self-consistent dRPA calculation instead of an exact exchange-only calculation. Total energies, reaction energies, and noncovalent binding energies obtained in this way are of the same quality as those of high-level quantum chemistry methods, like the coupled cluster singles doubles method which is computationally more demanding. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {The Luttinger-Ward functional $\Phi$[G], which expresses the thermodynamic grand potential in terms of the interacting single-particle Green's function G, is found to be ill defined for fermionic models with the Hubbard on-site interaction. In particular, we show that the self-energy $\Sigma$[G] $\delta$$\Phi$[G]/$\delta$G is not a single-valued functional of G: in addition to the physical solution for $\Sigma$[G], there exists at least one qualitatively distinct unphysical branch. This result is demonstrated for several models: the Hubbard atom, the Anderson impurity model, and the full two-dimensional Hubbard model. Despite this pathology, the skeleton Feynman diagrammatic series for $\Sigma$ in terms of G is found to converge at least for moderately low temperatures. However, at strong interactions, its convergence is to the unphysical branch. This reveals a new scenario of breaking down of diagrammatic expansions. In contrast, the bare series in terms of the noninteracting Green's function G0 converges to the correct physical branch of $\Sigma$ in all cases currently accessible by diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations. In addition to their conceptual importance, these observations have important implications for techniques based on the explicit summation of the diagrammatic series.},

The tuning methods can yield significantly improved orbital energies and orbital energy gaps, compared to those from conventional functionals. For systems with integer M electrons, optimal results are obtained using a tuning norm based on the highest occupied orbital energy of the M and M + 1 electron systems, with deviations of just 0.1-0.2 eV in these quantities, compared to exact values. However, detailed examination for the carbon atom illustrates a subtle cancellation between errors arising from nonlinearity and errors in the computed ionization potentials and electron affinities used in the tuning. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Noncovalent interactions between molecules with stretched intramonomer covalent bonds are a fascinating, yet little studied area. This shortage of information stems largely from the inability of most of the commonly used computational quantum chemistry methods to accurately describe weak long-range and strong nondynamic correlations at the same time. In this work, we propose a geminal-based approach, abbreviated as EERPA-GVB, capable of describing such systems in a robust manner using relatively inexpensive computational steps. By examining a few van der Waals complexes, we demonstrate that the elongation of one or more intramolecular covalent bonds leads to an enhanced attraction between the monomers. We show that this increase in attraction occurs as the electron density characterizing intramolecular covalent bonds depletes and migrates toward the region between the monomers. As the covalent intramonomer bonds continue to stretch, the intermolecular interaction potential passes through a minimum and eventually goes up. The findings resulting from our EERPA-GVB calculations are supported and further elucidated by the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory and coupled-cluster (CC) computations using methods that are as sophisticated as the CC approach with a full treatment of singly, doubly, and triply excited clusters.},

abstract = {Many approximations have been developed to help deal with the O(N(4)) growth of the electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor, where N is the number of one-electron basis functions used to represent the electronic wavefunction. Of these, the density fitting (DF) approximation is currently the most widely used despite the fact that it is often incapable of altering the underlying scaling of computational effort with respect to molecular size. We present a method for exploiting sparsity in three-center overlap integrals through tensor decomposition to obtain a low-rank approximation to density fitting (tensor hypercontraction density fitting or THC-DF). This new approximation reduces the 4th-order ERI tensor to a product of five matrices, simultaneously reducing the storage requirement as well as increasing the flexibility to regroup terms and reduce scaling behavior. As an example, we demonstrate such a scaling reduction for second- and third-order perturbation theory (MP2 and MP3), showing that both can be carried out in O(N(4)) operations. This should be compared to the usual scaling behavior of O(N(5)) and O(N(6)) for MP2 and MP3, respectively. The THC-DF technique can also be applied to other methods in electronic structure theory, such as coupled-cluster and configuration interaction, promising significant gains in computational efficiency and storage reduction.},

Exchange also becomes local in this limit. Numerical data on the correlation energy of atoms support the conjecture that this is also true for correlation, but much less relevant to atoms. We illustrate how expansions around a large particle number are equivalent to local density approximations and their strong relevance to density functional approximations. Analyzing highly accurate atomic correlation energies, we show that EC → -AC ZlnZ + BCZ as Z → ∞, where Z is the atomic number, AC is known, and we estimate BC to be about 37 mhartree. The local density approximation yields AC exactly, but a very incorrect value for BC, showing that the local approximation is less relevant for the correlation alone. This limit is a benchmark for the non-empirical construction of density functional approximations. We conjecture that, beyond atoms, the leading correction to the local density approximation in the large-Z limit generally takes this form, but with BC a functional of the TF density for the system. The implications for the construction of approximate density functionals are discussed.},

These interpolations greatly reduce large MP2 errors for typical $\pi$-stacking complexes (e.g., benzene-pyridine dimers) and for the L7 data set. They are also competitive with state-of-the-art dispersion enhanced functionals and can even significantly outperform them for a variety of data sets, such as CT7 and L7.},

By comparing our numerical data for the Hubbard model with analytical calculations for exactly solvable systems of increasing complexity [disordered binary mixture (BM), Falicov-Kimball (FK), and atomic limit (AL)], we have (i) identified two different kinds of divergence lines; (ii) classified them in terms of the frequency structure of the associated singular eigenvectors; and (iii) investigated their relation to the emergence of multiple branches in the Luttinger-Ward functional. In this way, we could distinguish the situations where the multiple divergences simply reflect the emergence of an underlying, single energy scale $\nu$∗ below which perturbation theory is no longer applicable, from those where the breakdown of perturbation theory affects, not trivially, different energy regimes. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on the theoretical understanding of the nonperturbative physics around the MIT and for future developments of many-body algorithms applicable in this regime.},

abstract = {The basis set superposition effect (BSSE) is a simple concept, and its validity is almost universally accepted. So is the counterpoise method to correct for it. The idea is that the basis set is biased toward the dimer because each monomer in the dimer can “use” the basis functions on the other monomer, which it cannot in a simple monomer calculation. This hypothesis can only be tested if basis set free benchmark numbers are available for monomers and dimer. We are testing the hypothesis on a few systems (in this paper Be2) that are small enough that sufficiently accurate benchmark numbers (basis set free, or close to basis set limit; full CI or close to full CI) are available or can be obtained. We find that the answer to the title question is negative: the standard basis sets of quantum chemistry appear to be biased toward the atom in the sense that basis set errors are larger for the dimer than the monomer. Applying the counterpoise correction increases the imbalance by reducing the already smaller basis set error of the monomer even further. Counterpoise corrected bond energies then deviate more from the basis set limit numbers than uncorrected bond energies. These conclusions hold both at the Hartree−Fock level and (much stronger) at the correlated (CCSD(T), full CI) levels. So the answer to the title question is No. I.},

abstract = {An implementation of scaled opposite-spin CC2 (SOS-CC2) for ground and excited state energies is presented that requires only fourth order scaling computational costs. The SOS-CC2 method yields results with an accuracy comparable to the unscaled method. Furthermore the time-determining fifth order scaling steps in the algorithm can be replaced by only fourth order scaling computational costs using a "resolution of the identity" approximation for the electron repulsion integrals and a Laplace transformation of the orbital energy denominators. This leads to a significant reduction of computational costs especially for large systems. Timings for ground and excited state calculations are shown and the error of the Laplace transformation is investigated. An application to a chlorophyll molecule with 134 atoms results in a speed-up by a factor of five and demonstrates how the new implementation extends the applicability of the method. A SOS variant of the algebraic diagrammatic construction through second order ADC(2), which arises from a simplification of the SOS-CC2 model, is also presented. The SOS-ADC(2) model is a cost-efficient alternative in particular for future extensions to spectral intensities and excited state structure optimizations.},

abstract = {In this work we analyze the accuracy and the efficiency of different schemes to obtain the complete basis set limit for CCSD(T). It is found that composite schemes using an MP2 increment to reach the basis set limit provide high accuracy combined with high efficiency. In these composite schemes the MP2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 method is suitable to compute the MP2 contribution at the basis set limit. We propose to use the def2-TZVP or the TZVPP basis sets at the coupled cluster level in combination with the cc-pVTZ-F12 basis set at the MP2 level to compute reaction energies close to the basis set limit, if high accuracy methods like CCSD(T)(F12∗) or 56-extrapolations are no longer feasible due to the computational effort. The standard deviation of CCSD(T)+$\Delta$MP2/cc-pVTZ-F12/def2-TZVP and CCSD(T)+$\Delta$MP2/cc-pVTZ-F12/TZVPP is found to be only 0.93 and 0.65 kJ/mol for a test set of 51 closed shell reactions. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive list of different computational strategies to obtain CCSD(T) reaction energies with an efficiency and accuracy measure. Finally we analyze how different choices of the exponent in the correlation factor ($\gamma$) change the results when using explicitly correlated methods.

All manipulations of four-index quantities (describing electron correlation effects) are carried out using small local orbital fragment spaces, whereas two-index quantities are treated for the full molecular system. The sizes of the orbital fragment spaces are determined in a black-box manner to ensure that the error in the DEC-MP2 correlation energy compared to a standard MP2 calculation is proportional to a single input threshold denoted the fragment optimization threshold (FOT). The FOT also implicitly controls the error in the DEC-MP2 molecular gradient as substantiated by a theoretical analysis and numerical results. The development of the DEC-MP2 molecular gradient is the initial step towards calculating higher order energy derivatives for large molecular systems using the DEC framework, both at the MP2 level of theory and for more accurate coupled-cluster methods.},

As such, it is a fundamental quantity in the context of redox chemistry, charge transfer, and molecular electronics. The accurate theoretical prediction of this property is therefore highly desirable for virtual materials design. Furthermore, vertical IPs are of interest in the development of many-body Green's function methods like the GW formalism, as well as density functionals and semiempirical methods. In this contribution, we report over 1468 vertical valence IPs calculated with the IP variant of equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory with singles and doubles (IP-EOM-CCSD) covering 155 molecules. The purpose of this is two-fold: First, the quality of the predicted IPs is compared with respect to experiments and higher-order coupled cluster theory. This confirms the overall high accuracy and robustness of this method, with some outliers which are discussed in detail. Second, a large set of consistent theoretical reference values for vertical valence IPs are generated. This addresses a lack of reliable reference data for lower-lying valence IPs, where experimental data are often unavailable or of dubious quality. The benchmark set is then used to assess the quality of the eigenvalues predicted by different density functional approximations (via Bartlett's IP-eigenvalue theorem) and the extended Koopmans' theorem approach. The QTP family of functionals are found to be remarkably accurate, low-cost alternatives to IP-EOM-CCSD.},

We compare perturbative GW, partially self-consistent GW and second-order Green function (GF2) methods for the computation of ionization potentials, electron affinities, energy gaps, correlation energies as well as singlet and triplet neutral excitations by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). We discuss the problem of self-screening in GW and show that it can be partially solved with a second-order screened exchange correction (SOSEX). We find that, in general, self-consistency deteriorates the results with respect to those obtained within perturbative approaches with a Hartree-Fock starting point. Finally, we unveil an important problem of partial self-consistency in GW: in the weakly correlated regime, it can produce artificial discontinuities in the self-energy caused by satellite resonances with large weights.},

@article{Schwinger1948,
abstract = {Attempts to avoid the divergence difficulties of quantum electrodynamics by multilation of the theory have been uniformly unsuccessful. The lack of convergence does indicate that a revision of electrodynamic concepts at ultrarelativistic energies is indeed necessary, but no appreciable alteration of the theory for moderate relativistic energies can be tolerated. The elementary phenomena in which divergences occur, in consequence of virtual transitions involving particles with unlimited energy, are the polarization of the vacuum and the self-energy of the electron, effects which essentially express the interaction of the electromagnetic and matter fields with their own vacuum fluctuations. The basic result of these fluctuation interactions is to alter the constants characterizing the properties of the individual fields, and their mutual coupling, albeit by infinite factors. The question is naturally posed whether all divergences can be isolated in such unobservable renormalization factors; more specifically, we inquire whether quantum electrodynamics can account unambiguously for the recently observed deviations from the Dirac electron theory, without the introduction of fundamentally new concepts. This paper, the first in a series devoted to the above question, is occupied with the formulation of a completely covariant electrodynamics. Manifest covariance with respect to Lorentz and gauge transformations is essential in a divergent theory since the use of a particular reference system or gauge in the course of calculation can result in a loss of covariance in view of the ambiguities that may be the concomitant of infinities. It is remarked, in the first section, that the customary canonical commutation relations, which fail to exhibit the desired covariance since they refer to field variables at equal times and different points of space, can be put in covariant form by replacing the four-dimensional surface t=const. by a space-like surface. The latter is such that light signals cannot be propagated between any two points on the surface. In this manner, a formulation of quantum electrodynamics is constructed in the Heisenberg representation, which is obviously covariant in all its aspects. It is not entirely suitable, however, as a practical means of treating electrodynamic questions, since commutators of field quantities at points separated by a time-like interval can be constructed only by solving the equations of motion. This situation is to be contrasted with that of the Schr{\"{o}}dinger representation, in which all operators refer to the same time, thus providing a distinct separation between kinematical and dynamical aspects. A formulation that retains the evident covariance of the Heisenberg representation, and yet offers something akin to the advantage of the Schr{\"{o}}dinger representation can be based on the distinction between the properties of non-interacting fields, and the effects of coupling between fields. In the second section, we construct a canonical transformation that changes the field equations in the Heisenberg representation into those of non-interacting fields, and therefore describes the coupling between fields in terms of a varying state vector. It is then a simple matter to evaluate commutators of field quantities at arbitrary space-time points. One thus obtains an obviously convariant and practical form of quantum electrodynamics, expressed in a mixed Heisenberg-Schr{\"{o}}dinger representation, which is called the interaction representation. The third section is devoted to a discussion of the covariant elimination of the longitudinal field, in which the customary distinction between longitudinal and transverse fields is replaced by a suitable covariant definition. The fourth section is concerned with the description of collision processes in terms of an invariant collision operator, which is the unitary operator that determines the over-all change in state of a system as the result of interaction. It is shown that the collision operator is simply related to the Hermitian reaction operator, for which a variational principle is constructed. {\textcopyright} 1948 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The past few years have seen a particularly rich period in the development of the explicitly correlated R12 theories of electron correlation. These theories bypass the slow convergence of conventional methods, by augmenting the traditional orbital expansions with a small number of terms that depend explicitly on the interelectronic distance r 12 . Amongst the very numerous discoveries and developments that we will review here, two stand out as being of particular interest. First, the fundamental numerical approximations of the R12 methods withstand the closest scrutiny: Kutzelnigg's use of the resolution of the identity and the generalized Brillouin condition to avoid many-electronic integrals remains sound. Second, it transpires that great gains in accuracy can be made by changing the dependence on the interelectronic coordinate from linear ( r 12 ) to some suitably chosen short-range form (e.g., exp(-$\alpha$r12 )). Modern R12 (or F12) methods can deliver MP2 energies (and beyond) that are converged to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol) in triple- or even double-zeta basis sets. Using a range of approximations, applications to large molecules become possible. Here, the major developments in the field are reviewed, and recommendations for future directions are presented. By comparing with commonly used extrapolation techniques, it is shown that modern R12 methods can deliver high accuracy dramatically faster than by using conventional methods. {\textcopyright} 2006 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

This code is also integrated with general tensor library libtensor and with the Q-Chem quantum-chemistry package. An overview of the algorithm, its implementation, and benchmarks are presented. Similarly to other tensor software, the algorithm exploits efficient matrix multiplication libraries and assumes that tensors are stored in a block-tensor form. The distinguishing features of the algorithm are: (i) efficient repackaging of the individual blocks into large matrices and back, which affords efficient graphics processing unit (GPU)-enabled calculations without modifications of higher-level codes; (ii) fully asynchronous data transfer between disk storage and fast memory. The algorithm enables canonical all-electron coupled-cluster and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster calculations with single and double substitutions (CCSD and EOM-CCSD) with over 1000 basis functions on a single quad-GPU machine.

Previous theoretical studies based on the GW approach has met mixed success, and in particular, the one-short (G0W0) or partially self-consistent (GW0) approaches with the local or semilocal density functional approximations plus the Hubbard U correction (GW@LDA+U) as the reference systematically underestimate the binding energies of occupied d or f states. In this work we have investigated quasiparticle electronic band structures of a series of d- or f-electron oxides including late transition metal mono-oxides (TMO, TM = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni), La2O3, CeO2, Ce2O3, and UO2. It is shown that a large part of the errors observed in previous GW studies can be attributed to numerical errors related to the inaccuracy of unoccupied states and the incompleteness of the summation of states, which can be effectively overcome by including high-energy local orbitals (HLOs) in the linearized augmented plane waves (LAPW) framework.},

In this article, we show that the correlationenergy may alternatively be expressed using a virtual space partitioning, and that the Lagrangiancorrelationenergy may be partitioned using elements from both the occupied and virtual partitioning schemes. The partitionings of the correlationenergy leads to atomic site and pair interaction energies which are term-wise invariant with respect to an orthogonal transformation among the occupied or the virtual orbitals. Evaluating the atomic site and pair interaction energies using local orbitals leads to a linear scaling algorithm and a distinction between Coulomb hole and dispersion energy contributions to the correlationenergy. Further, a detailed error analysis is performed illustrating the error control imposed on all components of the energy by the chosen energy threshold. This error control is ultimately used to show how to reduce the computational cost for evaluating dispersion energy contributions in DEC.},

Fundamental shortcomings of density functional theory (DFT) when applied to excitation energies as well as artifacts introduced by approximate exchange-correlation (XC) functionals are thus reduced. At its heart lies the quasi-particle (qp) equation, whose solution yields the corrected excitation energies and qp-wave functions. We propose an efficient approximation scheme to treat this equation based on second-order perturbation theory and self-consistent iteration schemes. We thus avoid solving (large) eigenvalue problems at the expense of a residual error that is comparable to the intrinsic uncertainty of the GW truncation scheme and is, in this sense, insignificant.},

We show that including ladder diagrams in W can greatly reduce the band gap overestimation of RPA-based QSGW. The resultant discrepency of the calculated band gap in this method is then attributed mostly to the fact that electron-phonon contributions to W are neglected; which would allow one to then obtain an estimate for the size of this effect. We present results for a range of systems from simple sp semiconductors to the strongly correlated systems NiO and CoO. Results for systems where the RPA-based QSGW band gap is larger than expected are investigated, and an estimate for the Frolich contribution to the gap is included in a few polar compounds where QSGW can overestimate the gap by as much as 2 eV.

Performance of a variety of DFT functionals for the isomerization energies is evaluated. This proves to be a challenging test: only six of the 56 tested functionals attain root mean square deviations (RMSDs) below 3kcalmol 1 (the performance of MP2), namely: 2.9 (B972-D), 2.8 (PW6B95), 2.7 (B3PW91-D), 2.2 (PWPB95-D3), 2.1 (B97X-D), and 1.2 (DSD-PBEP86) kcalmol 1.

abstract = {We present a new hybrid meta exchange-correlation functional, called M05-2X, for thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and noncovalent interactions. We also provide a full discussion of the new M05 functional, previously presented in a short communication. The M05 functional was parametrized including both metals and nonmetals, whereas M05-2X is a high-nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X) that is parametrized only for nonmetals. In particular, M05 was parametrized against 35 data values, and M05-2X is parametrized against 34 data values. Both functionals, along with 28 other functionals, have been comparatively assessed against 234 data values: the MGAE109/3 main-group atomization energy database, the IP13/3 ionization potential database, the EA13/3 electron affinity database, the HTBH38/4 database of barrier height for hydrogen-transfer reactions, five noncovalent databases, two databases involving metal-metal and metal-ligand bond energies, a dipole moment database, a database of four alkyl bond dissociation energies of alkanes and ethers, and three total energies of one-electron systems. We also tested the new functionals and 12 others for eight hydrogen-bonding and stacking interaction energies in nucleobase pairs, and we tested M05 and M05-2X and 19 other functionals for the geometry, dipole moment, and binding energy of HCN-BF3, which has recently been shown to be a very difficult case for density functional theory. We tested eight functionals for four more alkyl bond dissociation energies, and we tested 12 functionals for several additional bond energies with varying amounts of multireference character. On the basis of all the results for 256 data values in 18 databases in the present study, we recommend M05-2X, M05, PW6B95, PWB6K, and MPWB1K for general-purpose applications in thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions involving nonmetals and we recommend M05 for studies involving both metallic and nonmetallic elements. The M05 functional, essentially uniquely among the functionals with broad applicability to chemistry, also performs well not only for main-group thermochemistry and radical reaction barrier heights but also for transition-metal-transition-metal interactions. The M05-2X functional has the best performance for thermochemical kinetics, noncovalent interactions (especially weak interaction, hydrogen bonding, $\pi$⋯$\pi$ stacking, and interactions energies of nucleobases), and alkyl bond dissociation energies and the best composite results for energetics, excluding metals. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

It is shown that the new method not only outperforms post-Kohn-Sham RPA in describing noncovalent interactions but also gives accurate dipole moments demonstrating the high quality of the calculated densities. Furthermore, the main drawback of atomic orbital based methods, in increasing the prefactor as compared to their canonical counterparts, is overcome by introducing Cholesky decomposed projectors allowing the use of large basis sets.

The influence of the choice of main configurations used in the selection process is given close examination as well as the importance of the MO basis employed in the treatment as a whole; in the latter case a non-iterative procedure for obtaining approximate natural orbitals for such calculations is suggested. The resulting configuration selection procedure is equally applicable to all types of electronic states in any nuclear geometry and the results of the associated CI calculations are seen to be essentially equivalent to a complete treatment in which all single- and double-excitation species with respect to a series of dominant configurations in a given state are included. {\textcopyright} 1974, Springer-Verlag.

abstract = {The strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) semilocal density functional [J. Sun, A. Ruzsinszky, and J. P. Perdew, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)] obeys all 17 known exact constraints for meta-generalized-gradient approximations (meta-GGAs), and it includes some medium-range correlation effects. Long-range London dispersion interactions are still missing, but they can be accounted for via an appropriate correction scheme. In this study, we combine SCAN with an efficient London dispersion correction and show that lattice energies of simple organic crystals can be improved with the applied correction by 50{\%}. The London-dispersion corrected SCAN meta-GGA outperforms all other tested London-dispersion corrected meta-GGAs for molecular geometries. Our method yields mean absolute deviations (MADs) for main group bond lengths that are consistently below 1 pm, rotational constants with MADs of 0.2{\%}, and noncovalent distances with MADs below 1{\%}. For a large database of general main group thermochemistry and kinetics (∼800 chemical species), one of the lowest weighted mean absolute deviations for long-range corrected meta-GGA functionals is achieved. Noncovalent interactions are of average quality, and hydrogen bonded systems in particular seem to suffer from overestimated polarization related to the self-interaction error of SCAN. We also discuss some consequences of numerical sensitivity encountered for meta-GGAs.},

abstract = {We apply the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) approximation to the real, scalar $\phi$4 quantum field theory. By comparing to lattice Monte Carlo calculations, perturbation theory and standard mean field theory, we test the quality of the approximation in two, three, four and five dimensions. The quantities considered in these tests are the critical coupling for the transition to the ordered phase and the associated critical exponents $\nu$ and $\beta$. We also map out the phase diagram in the most relevant case of four dimensions. In two and three dimensions, DMFT incorrectly predicts a first-order phase transition for all bare quartic couplings, which is problematic, because the second-order nature of the phase transition of lattice $\phi$4 theory is crucial for taking the continuum limit. Nevertheless, by extrapolating the behavior away from the phase transition, one can obtain critical couplings and critical exponents. They differ from those of mean field theory and are much closer to the correct values. In four dimensions the transition is second order for small quartic couplings and turns weakly first order as the coupling increases beyond a tricritical value. In dimensions five and higher, DMFT gives qualitatively correct results, predicts reasonable values for the critical exponents and considerably more accurate critical couplings than standard mean field theory. The approximation works best for small values of the quartic coupling. We investigate the change from first- to second-order transition in the local limit of DMFT which is computationally much cheaper. We also discuss technical issues related to the convergence of the nonlinear self-consistency equation solver and the solution of the effective single-site model using Fourier-space Monte Carlo updates in the presence of a $\phi$4 interaction. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The random phase approximation (RPA) systematically overestimates the magnitude of the correlation energy and generally underestimates cohesive energies. This originates in part from the complete lack of exchange terms that would otherwise cancel Pauli exclusion principle violating (EPV) contributions. The uncanceled EPV contributions also manifest themselves in form of an unphysical negative pair density of spin-parallel electrons close to electron-electron coalescence. We follow considerations of many-body perturbation theory to propose an exchange correction that corrects the largest set of EPV contributions, while having the lowest possible computational complexity. The proposed method exchanges adjacent particle/hole pairs in the RPA diagrams, considerably improving the pair density of spin-parallel electrons close to coalescence in the uniform electron gas (UEG). The accuracy of the correlation energy is comparable to other variants of second-order screened exchange (SOSEX) corrections although it is slightly more accurate for the spin-polarized UEG. Its computational complexity scales as O(N5) or O(N4) in orbital space or real space, respectively. Its memory requirement scales as O(N2).},

The approach combines a deposition simulation, many-body Green's function theory, polarizable film embedding, and multimode electron-vibrational coupling and provides a molecular-level view on the interactions and processes giving rise to spectral features. This insight helps bridging the current gap between experimental UPS and theoretical models as accurate analyses are hampered by the energetic disorder, surface sensitivity of the measurement, and the complexity of excitation processes. In particular, this is relevant for the unambiguous determination the highest occupied molecular orbital energy (HOMO) of organic semiconductors, a key quantity for tailoring and engineering new optoelectronic devices. We demonstrate the capabilities of the simulation approach studying the spectrum of two isomers of 2-methyl-9,10-bis(naphthalen-2-yl)anthracene as archetypical materials showing a clearly separated HOMO peak in experiment. The agreement with experiment is excellent, suggesting that our approach provides a route for determining the HOMO energy with an accuracy better than 0.1 eV.},

abstract = {The ground-state energy and low-energy excitations of single-particle character of an infinite medium of fermions are discussed with the aid of time-dependent Green's functions, which are convenient generalizations of the exact particle correlation functions in the ground state of N particles. The power series development for the one- and two-particle functions, under the restriction to two-body forces, is derived and described by means of Feynman diagrams. The derivation of the linked-cluster expansion for the energy then follows immediately. The equivalence to previous versions is established. The one-particle function is examined in particular detail, and it is shown that the poles of its space-time Fourier transform studied as a function of the energy variable, for fixed momentum, determined the (N+1)-particle and (N-1)-particle excited states which have single-particle character. For a reasonable assumption about the full spectrum of excited states, it is found that for the interacting system, single-particle excitations with a real energy occur only at the Fermi momentum. It is pointed out that the corresponding energy, termed the perturbed Fermi energy, equals the binding energy per particle in the ground state of N particles for a saturating system at equilibrium density. It is shown, finally, that the entire structure of the theory may be carried over to the case of finite temperature, requiring only a redefinition of the Green's functions. The analogy is constructed from a discussion of the internal energy. {\textcopyright} 1958 The American Physical Society.},

Here we show that this interpretation, which has been supported by numerous "ab initio" simulations, has to be reconsidered. Using a fully self-consistent GW + extended dynamical mean-field theory calculation we find that the screening from nonlocal Coulomb interactions substantially reduces the effective local Coulomb repulsion, and at the same time leads to strong plasmonic effects. The resulting effective local interactions are too weak to produce pronounced Hubbard bands in the local spectral function, while prominent plasmon satellites appear at energies which agree with those of the experimentally observed sidebands. Our results demonstrate the important role of nonlocal interactions and dynamical screening in determining the effective interaction strength of correlated compounds.},

The quality of these approximations in a range of basis sets is assessed against reference calculations in a large aug-pcseg-4 basis. Our results confirm that density fitting of the Coulomb contribution can be used without hesitation for all the studied properties. The ADMM treatment of exchange is shown to yield high accuracy for ground-state and excitation energies, whereas for polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities the performance gain comes at a cost of accuracy.

Vibrational characteristic features of these spectra in the amide I vibration region are discussed. From the semiempirical quantum chemistry calculation results on an isolated ubiquitin, amide I local mode frequencies and vibrational coupling constants were fully determined. It turns out that the amide I local mode frequencies of ubiquitin in both gas phase and aqueous solution are highly heterogeneous and site dependent. To directly test the quantitative validity of thus obtained spectroscopic properties, they compared the experimentally measured amide I IR, 2D IR, and electronic circular dichroism spectra with experiments, and found good agreements between theory and experiments. However, the simulated VCD spectrum is just qualitatively similar to the experimentally measured one. This indicates that, due to delicate cancellations between the positive and negative VCD contributions, the prediction of protein VCD spectrum is critically relied on quantitative accuracy of the theoretical model for predicting amide I local mode frequencies. On the basis of the present comparative investigations, they found that the site dependency of amide I local mode frequency, i.e., diagonal heterogeneity of the vibrational Hamiltonian matrix in the amide I local mode basis, is important. It is believed that the present computational methods for simulating various vibrational and electronic spectra of proteins will be of use in further refining classical force fields and in addressing the structure-spectra relationships of proteins in solution. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Many references exist in the density functional theory (DFT) literature to the chemical potential of the electrons in an atom or a molecule. The origin of this notion has been the identification of the Lagrange multiplier {\$}\backslashmu = \backslashpartial E/\backslashpartial N{\$} in the Euler-Lagrange variational equation for the ground state density as the chemical potential of the electrons. We first discuss why the Lagrange multiplier in this case is an arbitrary constant and therefore cannot be a physical characteristic of an atom or molecule. The switching of the energy derivative ("chemical potential") from {\$}-I{\$} to {\$}-A{\$} when the electron number crosses the integer, called integer discontinuity or derivative discontinuity, is not physical but only occurs when the nonphysical noninteger electron systems and the corresponding energy and derivative {\$}\backslashpartial E/\backslashpartial N{\$} are chosen in a specific discontinuous way. The question is discussed whether in fact the thermodynamical concept of a chemical potential can be defined for the electrons in such few-electron systems as atoms and molecules. The conclusion is that such systems lack important characteristics of thermodynamic systems and do not afford the definition of a chemical potential. They also cannot be considered as analogues of the open systems of thermodynamics that can exchange particles with an environment (a particles bath or other members of a Gibbsian ensemble). Thermodynamical (statistical mechanical) concepts like chemical potential, open systems, grand canonical ensemble etc. are not applicable to a few electron system like an atom or molecule. A number of topics in DFT are critically reviewed in the light of these findings: jumps in the Kohn-Sham potential when crossing an integer number of electrons, the band gap problem, the deviation-from-straight-lines error, the role of ensembles in DFT.},

Here, we introduce the tensor hypercontraction (THC) approximation to CC2 (THC-CC2), which reduces the scaling to O(N(4)) and the storage requirements to O(N(2)). We present an algorithm to efficiently evaluate the THC-CC2 correlation energy and demonstrate its quartic scaling.

The accuracy of the CC2 correlation energy under these approximations is shown to be suitable for most practical applications.},

abstract = {Efficient computer implementations of the GW approximation must approximate a numerically challenging frequency integral; the integral can be performed analytically, but doing so leads to an expensive implementation whose computational cost scales as O(N6), where N is the size of the system. Here, we introduce a new formulation of the full-frequency GW approximation by exactly recasting it as an eigenvalue problem in an expanded space. This new formulation (1) avoids the use of time or frequency grids, (2) naturally obviates the need for the common "diagonal"approximation, (3) enables common iterative eigensolvers that reduce the canonical scaling to O(N5), and (4) enables a density-fitted implementation that reduces the scaling to O(N4). We numerically verify these scaling behaviors and test a variety of approximations that are motivated by this new formulation. The new formulation is found to be competitive with conventional O(N4) methods based on analytic continuation or contour deformation. In this new formulation, the relation of the GW approximation to configuration interaction, coupled-cluster theory, and the algebraic diagrammatic construction is made especially apparent, providing a new direction for improvements to the GW approximation.},

Basis functions were added to the existing cc-pVXZ sets to form correlation-consistent polarized core-valence sets (cc-pCVXZ) in the usual pattern: Double zeta added (1s1p), triple zeta added (2s2p1d), quadruple zeta added (3s3p2d1f), and quintuple zeta added (4s4p3d2f1g). The exponents of the core functions were determined by minimizing the difference between all-electron and valence-only correlation energies obtained from HF+1+2 calculations on the ground states of the atoms. With the cc-pCVXZ sets, core, core-valence, and valence correlation energies all converge exponentially toward apparent complete basis set (CBS) limits, as do the corresponding all-electron singles and doubles CI energies. Several test applications of the new sets are presented: The first two ionization potentials of boron, the 3P-5S separation in carbon, and the X̃ 3B1-{\~{a}} 1A1 state separation in CH2.

Particular emphasis is placed on assignment of bands in matrix infrared spectra of trapped graphite vapor. The relative energetics of linear and cyclic isomers of C6, C8, and C10 were investigated at the CCSD(T) level using basis sets of [4s3p2dlf] quality. Our best calculations predict that the ground state structure of C6 is a cumulenic D3h, ring and that of C8 a polyacetylenic C4h, ring. Linear 3∑g- states are close in energy (13 ± ' 2 and 8 ±2 kcal/mol, respectively), and both forms should be observable. The ground state structure of cyclic C10 clearly has D5h, rather than D10h, symmetry, at least for the re geometry. A linear regression of computed CCSD(T)/[3s2pld] harmonic frequencies vs observed fundamentals for the previously assigned stretching frequencies of linear Cn clusters has a very high correlation coefficient (up to r = 0.99975 at 10 data points). From the regression line and the calculated frequencies, band origins for linear C8 are predicted at 2063 ±18 and 1711 ±14 cm-1 (99{\%} confidence intervals) and ancillary bands for linear C9 at 2093 ± 18 and 1604 ±16 cm-1. From the calculated infrared-active CCSD(T) frequencies for the cyclic clusters and anharmonicity considerations, we suggest that bands near 1695, 1818, and 1915 or 1921 cm-1 belong to cyclic C6, C8, and C10, respectively, while bands near 1590 and 1715 cm-1 are probably due to linear C9 and C8, respectively. Finally, a broad feature at 2070-2090 cm-1, which upon deconvolution appears to consist of three bands, is suggested to contain bands of both linear C8 and C9. {\textcopyright} 1996 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A stochastic orbital approach to the resolution of identity (RI) approximation for 4-index electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) is presented. The stochastic RI-ERIs are then applied to second order M{\o}ller−Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) utilizing a multiple stochastic orbital approach. The introduction of multiple stochastic orbitals results in an O(N AO 3) scaling for both the stochastic RI-ERIs and stochastic RI-MP2, N AO being the number of basis functions. For a range of water clusters we demonstrate that this method exhibits a small prefactor and observed scalings of O(N e 2.4) for total energies and O(N e 3.1) for forces (N e being the number of correlated electrons), outperforming MP2 for clusters with as few as 21 water molecules. ■ INTRODUCTION The vast majority of ab initio electronic structure methods require the calculation of 4-index electron repulsion integrals (ERIs). In fact, in some instances, when atom-centered Gaussian basis sets are used, the calculation of these integrals and their transformation from the atomic orbital (AO) to the molecular orbital (MO) basis are the computational bottleneck, e.g., second order M{\o}ller−Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). An appreciable reduction in the computational prefactor may be obtained through the resolution of identity (RI) approximation, also known as the density fitting approximation. 1−5 The RI approximation expresses the 4-index ERIs in terms of 2-index and 3-index ERIs, the former being evaluated in an auxiliary basis and the latter as a combination of the AO and auxiliary basis sets. Since only 2-and 3-index ERIs are needed, the RI approximation reduces the total number of integrals to be calculated and transformed. Today it has become common practice to apply the RI approximation to 4-index ERIs in order to lower the computational prefactor. However, in spite of these benefits, the assembly of the approximate ERIs scales as O(N 5), N being the number of basis functions, and therefore the scaling remains unaltered. Recent work focused on mitigating the high computational cost associated with the 4-index ERIs, through the application of a tensor decomposition technique known as tensor hypercontraction, 6−8 has resulted in flexible factorization of the ERIs and reduced scaling. As an alternative to reduced scaling techniques focused on the ERIs, stochastic approaches to performing traditional electronic structure calculations have proven effective in reducing the high computational cost. 9−27 There are many successful stochastic techniques that can handle increasingly larger systems. We note, for example, that in certain situations the full configuration-interaction quantum Monte Carlo approach can handle systems with tens of electrons. 9−12 Likewise, auxiliary-field Monte Carlo which replaces the two-body interaction by an interaction with fluctuating densities and the fixed-node approximation, 28 when combined with the shifted-contour approach 29 give excellent results for systems with tens of electrons. 30 For large systems containing hundreds or thousands of electrons several of the authors have developed stochastic methods for DFT and TDDFT, 21,26,27,31 MP2, 19,24 GF2, 32 GW, 25,33−35 and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. 25 Given the success of the RI approximation and stochastic electronic structure methods, it is therefore conceivable that methods that bring together the strengths of both approaches could prove extremely beneficial. In this letter, we present a hybrid approach, stochastic resolution of identity (sRI), that (i) lowers the computational scaling of the RI approximation to the 4-index ERIs and (ii) decouples pairs of indices within the 4-index ERI expression, a general feature capable of bringing about additional method-specific reductions in scaling. We apply the sRI approximation to the time-integrated MP2 expression and obtain an observed scaling of O(N e 2.4), where N e is the number of correlated electrons.},

By virtue of its full nonlocality, RPA correlation is compatible with exact Hartree-Fock-type exchange and describes van der Waals interactions exceptionally well [B. G. Janesko, J. Chem. Phys. 130, 081105 (2009); J. Chem. Phys. 131, 034110 (2009)]. One caveat is that RPA correlation contains one-electron self-interaction error, which leads to disturbingly large correlation energies in the stretched bond situation of, e.g. H2+, He 2+, or Ne2+. In the present work, we show that inclusion of second-order screened exchange rectifies the aforementioned failure of RPA correlation. We present a large number of molecular benchmark results obtained using full-range as well as long-range corrected hybrids incorporating second-order screened exchange correlation. This correction has a generally small, and sometimes undesirable, effect on RPA predictions for chemical properties, but appears to be very beneficial for the dissociation of H2+, He 2+, and Ne 2+. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

We calculate one-electron spectra, dielectric properties, compressibility, and correlation energy. Considerable reduction in the calculated bandwidth (as compared to the self-consistent GW result) has been found when vertex correction was used for both polarizability and self-energy. Generally, it is advantageous to obtain the diagrammatic representation of polarizability from the definition of this quantity as a functional derivative of the electronic density with respect to the total field (external plus induced). For self-energy, the first-order vertex correction seems to be sufficient for the range of densities considered. Whenever it is possible, we compare the accuracy of our vertex-corrected schemes with the accuracy of the self-consistent quasiparticle GW approximation (QSGW), which is less expensive computationally. We show that the QSGW approach performs poorly and we relate this poor performance with an inaccurate description of the screening in the QSGW method (with an error comprising a factor 2-3 in the physically important range of momenta).},

The method is based on freezing the electron density of the solvent molecules, while solving the eigenvalue problem for the solute Hamiltonian, which includes the effective potential of the solvent molecules. The method is developed and examined in the simple case of one solvent and one solute molecule. The results are encouraging and the deviation between the unfrozen and frozen treatments can be attributed to the kinetic energy functional used. The method can be implemented in ab initio calculations of solvation free energies, following a recent pseudopotential approach [Vaidehi et al., 1992]. {\textcopyright} 1993 American Chemical Society.},

Our calculated transport gap is found to be in excellent agreement with reference periodic bulk GW calculations, together with properly parametrized classical microelectrostatic calculations, and with photoionization measurements at crystal surfaces. More importantly, we prove that the gap is insensitive to the partitioning of pentacene molecules in QM and MM subsystems, as a result of the mutual compensation of quantum and classical polarizabilities, clarifying the relation between polarization energy and delocalization. The proposed hybrid method offers a computationally attractive strategy to compute the full spectrum of charged excitations in complex molecular environments, accounting for both QM and MM contributions to the polarization energy, a crucial requirement in the limit of large QM subsystems.},

abstract = {Quasiparticle excitation energies and optical properties of TiO2 in the rutile and anatase structures are calculated using many-body perturbation-theory methods. Calculations are performed for a frozen crystal lattice; electron-phonon coupling is not explicitly considered. In the GW method, several approximations are compared and it is found that inclusion of the full frequency dependence as well as explicit treatment of the Ti semicore states are essential for accurate calculation of the quasiparticle energy-band gap. The calculated quasiparticle energies are in good agreement with available photoemission and inverse photoemission experiments. The results of the GW calculations, together with the calculated static screened Coulomb interaction, are utilized in the Bethe-Salpeter equation to calculate the dielectric function 2 ($\omega$) for both the rutile and anatase structures. The results are in good agreement with experimental observations, particularly the onset of the main absorption features around 4 eV. For comparison to low-temperature optical-absorption measurements that resolve individual excitonic transitions in rutile, the low-lying discrete excitonic energy levels are calculated with electronic screening only. The lowest energy exciton found in the energy gap of rutile has a binding energy of 0.13 eV. In agreement with experiment, it is not dipole allowed but the calculated exciton energy exceeds that measured in absorption experiments by about 0.22 eV and the scale of the exciton binding energy is also too large. The quasiparticle energy alignment of rutile is calculated for nonpolar (110) surfaces. In the GW approximation, the valence-band maximum is 7.8 eV below the vacuum level, showing a small shift from density-functional theory results. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Exchange-correlation energy functionals depending on the Kohn-Sham orbitals and eigenvalues resolve some of the well-known deficiencies of the local density and generalized gradient approximations. Such functionals can be derived in first-principles fashion by use of standard many-body techniques, if the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian is utilized as non-interacting reference Hamiltonian. In this way one can establish an exact relation for the exchange-correlation functional, which opens several routes for the derivation of approximate functionals. Straightforward expansion in powers of the electron-electron coupling constant gives, to first order, the exact exchange of density functional theory and, to second order, a correlation functional which has the same structure as the second order M{\o}ller-Plesset term. This simplest first-principles correlation functional reproduces both the shell structure in the exact correlation potential and dispersion forces. On the other hand, it overestimates all correlation effects and is variationally instable for systems with a very small HOMO-LUMO gap. Both deficiences can be resolved by partial resununation of the Kohn-Sham perturbation expansion. In this contribution two such resummations are discussed, a minimum form designed to address the variational instability at no computational cost (based on the Epstein-Nesbet diagrams) and a more systematic variant (based on the ring diagrams). {\textcopyright} by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag.},

abstract = {Abstract It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard ?zero-damping? formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The calculated energies were within a root-mean-square deviation of 0.0014 eV from the observed values when the CAM-B3LYP-related parameter $\mu$ which is associated with the long-range correlation, was set to 0.14. Calculations using $\mu$ = 0.14 also reproduced the observed transition-dipole strengths of the Qy-band moments, and the observed absorption spectra, with linewidths of ∼0.05 eV. These results suggest that $\mu$ = 0.14 can be used for absorption-energy calculations for Chla and Chlb.},

abstract = {One-particle Green's functions obtained from the self-consistent solution of the Dyson equation can be employed in the evaluation of spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties for both molecules and solids. However, typical acceleration techniques used in the traditional quantum chemistry self-consistent algorithms cannot be easily deployed for the Green's function methods because of a non-convex grand potential functional and a non-idempotent density matrix. Moreover, the optimization problem can become more challenging due to the inclusion of correlation effects, changing chemical potential, and fluctuations of the number of particles. In this paper, we study acceleration techniques to target the self-consistent solution of the Dyson equation directly. We use the direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS), the least-squared commutator in the iterative subspace (LCIIS), and the Krylov space accelerated inexact Newton method (KAIN). We observe that the definition of the residual has a significant impact on the convergence of the iterative procedure. Based on the Dyson equation, we generalize the concept of the commutator residual used in DIIS and LCIIS and compare it with the difference residual used in DIIS and KAIN. The commutator residuals outperform the difference residuals for all considered molecular and solid systems within both GW and GF2. For a number of bond-breaking problems, we found that an easily obtained high-temperature solution with effectively suppressed correlations is a very effective starting point for reaching convergence of the problematic low-temperature solutions through a sequential reduction of temperature during calculations.},

The challenge for quantum chemical methods arises both from the intrinsic complexity of the electronic structure problem and, in the case of biological models, from the need to account for protein-pigment interactions. In this work, we report electronic structure calculations of unprecedented accuracy for the low-energy excited states in the Q and B bands of chlorophyll a. This is achieved by using the newly developed domain-based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) implementation of the similarity transformed equation of motion coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations (STEOM-CCSD) in combination with sufficiently large and flexible basis sets. The results of our DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD calculations are compared with more approximate approaches. The results demonstrate that, in contrast to time-dependent density functional theory, the DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD method provides a balanced performance for both absorption bands. In addition to vertical excitation energies, we have calculated the vibronic spectrum for the Q and B bands through a combination of DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD and ground-state density functional theory frequency calculations. These results serve as a basis for comparison with gas-phase experiments.},

abstract = {For atomic thin layer insulating materials we provide an exact analytic form of the two-dimensional (2D) screened potential. In contrast to three-dimensional systems where the macroscopic screening can be described by a static dielectric constant, in 2D systems the macroscopic screening is nonlocal (q dependent) showing a logarithmic divergence for small distances and reaching the unscreened Coulomb potential for large distances. The crossover of these two regimes is dictated by 2D layer polarizability that can be easily computed by standard first-principles techniques. The present results have strong implications for describing gap-impurity levels and also exciton binding energies. The simple model derived here captures the main physical effects and reproduces well, for the case of graphane, the full many-body GW plus Bethe-Salpeter calculations. As an additional outcome we show that the impurity hole-doping in graphane leads to strongly localized states, which hampers applications in electronic devices. In spite of the inefficient and nonlocal two-dimensional macroscopic screening we demonstrate that a simple k•p approach is capable to describe the electronic and transport properties of confined 2D systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The electronic energy levels of some representative isolated and oxide-supported organic dyes, relevant for photovoltaic applications, are investigated using many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation. We consider a set of all-organic dyes (denominated L0, L2, L3, and L4) featuring the same donor and anchor groups and differing for the linker moieties. We first calculate the energy levels of the isolated molecules, thus allowing us to address the effects of the different linker groups, and resulting in good agreement with photo-electron spectroscopic and electrochemical data. We then consider the L0 dye adsorbed on the (101) surface of anatase-TiO2. We find a density of occupied states in agreement with experimental photo-electron data. The HOMO-LUMO energy gap of the L0 dye is found to be reduced by ∼1 eV upon adsorption. Our results validate the reliability of GW calculations for photovoltaic applications and point to their potential as a powerful tool for the screening and rational design of new components of electrochemical solar cells. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Fourth-order Moller - Plesset (MP4) correlation energies are computed for 28 atoms and simple molecules employing Dunning's correlation-consistent polarized-valence m-zeta basis sets for m = 2, 3, 4, and 5. Extrapolation formulas are used to predict MP4 energies for infinitely large basis sets. It is shown that both total and partial MP4 correlation energies can be extrapolated to limit values and that the sum of extrapolated partial MP4 energies equals the extrapolated total MP4 correlation energy within calculational accuracy. Therefore, partial MP4 correlation energies can be presented in the form of an MP4 spectrum reflecting the relative importance of different correlation effects. Typical trends in calculated correlation effects for a given class of electron systems are independent of the basis set used. As first found by Cremer and He [(1996) J Phys Chem 100:6173], one can use MP4 spectra to distinguish between electron systems with well-separated electron pairs and systems for which electrons cluster in a confined region of atomic or molecular space. MP4 spectra for increasing size of the basis set reveal that smaller basis set calculations underestimate the importance of three-electron correlation effects for both classes by overestimating the importance of pair correlation effects. The minimum size of a basis set required for reliable MP4 calculations is given by a valence triple-zeta polarized basis, which even in the case of anions performs better than a valence double-zeta basis augmented by diffuse functions.},

abstract = {Natural photosynthesis relies on light harvesting and excitation energy transfer by specialized pigment-protein complexes. Their structure and the electronic properties of the embedded chromophores define the mechanisms of energy transfer. An important example of a pigment-protein complex is CP47, one of the integral antennae of the oxygen-evolving photosystem II (PSII) that is responsible for efficient excitation energy transfer to the PSII reaction center. The charge-transfer excitation induced among coupled reaction center chromophores resolves into charge separation that initiates the electron transfer cascade driving oxygenic photosynthesis. Mapping the distribution of site energies among the 16 chlorophyll molecules of CP47 is essential for understanding excitation energy transfer and overall antenna function. In this work, we demonstrate a multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach utilizing full time-dependent density functional theory with modern range-separated functionals to compute for the first time the excitation energies of all CP47 chlorophylls in a complete membrane-embedded cyanobacterial PSII dimer. The results quantify the electrostatic effect of the protein on the site energies of CP47 chlorophylls, providing a high-level quantum chemical excitation profile of CP47 within a complete computational model of “near-native” cyanobacterial PSII. The ranking of site energies and the identity of the most red-shifted chlorophylls (B3, followed by B1) differ from previous hypotheses in the literature and provide an alternative basis for evaluating past approaches and semiempirically fitted sets. Given that a lot of experimental studies on CP47 and other light-harvesting complexes utilize extracted samples, we employ molecular dynamics simulations of isolated CP47 to identify which parts of the polypeptide are most destabilized and which pigments are most perturbed when the antenna complex is extracted from PSII. We demonstrate that large parts of the isolated complex rapidly refold to non-native conformations and that certain pigments (such as chlorophyll B1 and $\beta$-carotene h1) are so destabilized that they are probably lost upon extraction of CP47 from PSII. The results suggest that the properties of isolated CP47 are not representative of the native complexed antenna. The insights obtained from CP47 are generalizable, with important implications for the information content of experimental studies on biological light-harvesting antenna systems.},

abstract = {With the aim of properly understanding the basis for and the utility of many-body perturbation theory as applied to extended metallic systems, we have calculated the electronic self-energy of the homogeneous electron gas within the GW approximation. The calculation has been carried out in a self-consistent way; i.e., the one-electron Green function obtained from Dyson's equation is the same as that used to calculate the self-energy. The self-consistency is restricted in the sense that the screened interaction W is kept fixed and equal to that of the random-phase approximation for the gas. We have found that the final results are marginally affected by the broadening of the quasiparticles, and that their self-consistent energies are still close to their free-electron counterparts as they are in non-self-consistent calculations. The reduction in strength of the quasiparticles and the development of satellite structure (plasmons) gives, however, a markedly smaller dynamical self-energy leading to, e.g., a smaller reduction in the quasiparticle strength as compared to non-self-consistent results. The relatively bad description of plasmon structure within the non-self-consistent GW approximation is marginally improved. A first attempt at including W in the self-consistency cycle leads to an even broader and structureless satellite spectrum in disagreement with experiment. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The STERNHEIMERGW software uses time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory to evaluate GW quasiparticle band structures and spectral functions for solids. Both the Green's function G and the screened Coulomb interaction W are obtained by solving linear Sternheimer equations, thus overcoming the need for a summation over unoccupied states. The code targets the calculation of accurate spectral properties by convoluting G and W using a full frequency integration. The linear response approach allows users to evaluate the spectral function at arbitrary electron wavevectors, which is particularly useful for indirect band gap semiconductors and for simulations of angle-resolved photoelectron spectra. The software is parallelized efficiently, integrates with version 6.3 of Quantum Espresso, and is continuously monitored for stability using a test farm. Program summary: Program Title: STERNHEIMERGW Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/7ywzjng9t5.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License v3.0 Programming language: Fortran 2003 Nature of problem: The lack of the exchange–correlation discontinuity in density-functional theory (DFT) leads to a systematic underestimation of the band gap between conduction and valence states. Many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation provides an effective solution to this problem, as well as other limitations faced by DFT in the description of electronic excitations. However, the GW method comes with its own set of limitations: (i) The perturbation of the system is typically expressed in terms of the unoccupied states, and achieving numerical convergence with respect to these states is often cumbersome. Since the underlying DFT codes rely only on the occupied states, their default behavior is often ill-suited to provide a sufficient amount of empty states. Combined with the large number of parameters that need to be converged, this limits the use of GW codes by non-expert users and automatic scripts. (ii) Currently, GW codes require that a homogeneous k-point mesh is used in the calculation. Hence, features close to the band edges are often only accessible via prohibitively expensive dense k-point meshes or interpolation techniques. (iii) To evaluate the frequency convolution of the Green's function G and the screened Coulomb interaction W, many current GW calculations rely on approximations such as the plasmon-pole approximation, the analytic continuation, or the contour deformation. The relative merits and accuracy of the various approximations are not fully understood. Solution method: In STERNHEIMERGW, we address (i) by replacing the summation over unoccupied states with a linear response equation. The solution depends on the occupied states only, and it employs linear response algorithms already provided by the Quantum ESPRESSO suite to compute phonons and related properties. As an additional benefit, transforming the problem in a linear response equation removes the restriction to homogeneous k-point meshes (ii), so that the GW self-energy for any arbitrary point can be evaluated. Finally (iii), we provide the possibility to perform a full frequency convolution along the real frequency axis. This feature can serve as a benchmark for approximate integrations using models or analytic continuation.},

Contrary to conventional RS-DFT schemes that require an ad hoc range-separation parameter $\mu$, the key ingredient here is a range-separation function $\mu$(r) that automatically adapts to the spatial nonhomogeneity of the basis-set incompleteness error.

abstract = {Electron correlations of an electron liquid at metallic densities are studied by means of a diagrammatic method, the primary aim being the interpretation of the spectral structure observed for several metals in recent inelastic electron and x-ray scattering experiments. Several sum rules and requirements such as the positivity of the pair distribution function, the compressibility sum rule, the frequency moment sum rules, and the conservation law of the local electron number which have hitherto been regarded as guiding principles in theoretical formulation are first examined and discussed in a critical manner. Detailed examinations are made of the proper polarization function within the Hartree-Fock approximation. The lowest-order perturbation expressions giving two-pair excitations and one-pair-one-plasmon excitations are next examined. It is pointed out that these expressions are indeed divergent in the usual one-pair excitation region; the renormalization of the one-particle Green's function is indispensable there. From the above considerations and further discussions, the quasi-one-pair excitation approximation is presented for the purpose of describing the spectral shape in the dynamical structure factor S(q,) in the intermediate wave-number and intermediate frequency regions. In the quasi-one-pair excitation approximation the proper polarization function is constructed from a coherent part of the renormalized one-particle Green's function and a static part of the irreducible particle-hole interaction including strong short-range correlations. {\textcopyright} 1982 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inpatient care constitutes the most expensive component of psychiatric services and pressure is increasingly being mounted on clinicians to discharge patients early. With the advent of managed care in Nigeria, psychiatrists as well as other physicians will be faced with the challenge of having to justify patient's length of hospital admission. This study was designed to examine the factors that influence the length of stay (LOS) in an acute psychiatric ward. METHODS: A list of all patients admitted to the psychiatric unit of the UCH for the twelve month period between June 1st 2006 and May 31st 2007 was compiled from the ward admission registers. Data were extracted from the patient's case notes using specially designed data record forms. RESULTS: There were a total of three hundred and seventy one (371) admissions made up of three hundred and thirty three (333) patients, out of which a total of 247 (74.5{\%}) case notes were successfully reviewed. The most common diagnoses necessitating admission were schizophrenia and mood disorders. The mean LOS was 28.7 days and bed turnover for this period was 5.8. Factors found to be significantly associated with longer LOS include age, diagnosis, previous admissions and receiving electroconvulsive therapy with medication. These factors need to be considered in determining the period of hospitalization covered under managed care schemes.},

@article{Reining2018,
abstract = {Many observables such as the density, total energy, or electric current, can be expressed explicitly in terms of the one-body Green's function, which describes electron addition or removal to or from a system. An efficient way to determine such a Green's function is to introduce a self-energy, which is a nonlocal and dynamic effective potential that influences the propagation of particles in an interacting system. The state-of-the art approximation for the self-energy is the GW approximation, where the system to (or from) which the electron is added (or removed) is described as a polarizable, screening, medium. This is expressed by the name of the approximation: ‘GW' stands for the one-body Green's function G and for W, the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction. The GW approximation is very popular for the calculation of band structures in solids, and increasingly used also to describe nanostructures, clusters, and molecules. As compared to static mean-field approximations for the effective potential, the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction in GW leads to a renormalization of energies, to broadening and/or to the observation of additional excitations. An analysis of the approximations that lead to the GW self-energy, and of the underlying picture, explains the successes and the limitations of the approach.

abstract = {A few self-consistent schemes to solve the Hedin equations are presented. They include vertex corrections of different complexity. Commonly used quasiparticle approximation for the Green's function and static approximation for the screened interaction are avoided altogether. Using alkali metals Na and K as well as semiconductor Si and wide-gap insulator LiF as examples, it is shown that both the vertex corrections in the polarizability P and in the self-energy $\Sigma$ are important. Particularly, vertex corrections in $\Sigma$ with proper treatment of frequency dependence of the screened interaction always reduce calculated bandwidths/band gaps, improving the agreement with experiment. The complexity of the vertex included in P and in $\Sigma$ can be different. Whereas in the case of polarizability one generally has to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the corresponding vertex function, it is enough (for the materials in this study) to include the vertex of the first order in the self-energy. The calculations with appropriate vertices show remarkable improvement in the calculated bandwidths and band gaps as compared to the self-consistent GW approximation as well as to the self-consistent quasiparticle GW approximation.},

Thus, a new point of view to solvation phenomena is presented, which provides an alternative access to many questions of scientific and technical importance. The whole theory is based on the results of molecular orbital continuum solvation models.

Here, we apply the spin-flip ansatz (which considers the lowest triplet state as the reference configuration instead of the singlet ground state) to the BSE formalism in order to access, in particular, double excitations. The present scheme is based on a spin-unrestricted version of the GW approximation employed to compute the charged excitations and screened Coulomb potential required for the BSE calculations. Dynamical corrections to the static BSE optical excitations are taken into account via an unrestricted generalization of our recently developed (renormalized) perturbative treatment. The performance of the present spin-flip BSE formalism is illustrated by computing excited-state energies of the beryllium atom, the hydrogen molecule at various bond lengths, and cyclobutadiene in its rectangular and square-planar geometries.},

abstract = {While density functional theory (DFT) has been proven to be extremely useful for the prediction of thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of molecules, to date most functionals used in common implementations of DFT display a systematic failure to predict the properties of charge-transfer processes. While this is explicitly manifest in Rydberg transitions of atoms and molecules and in molecular charge-transfer spectroscopy, it also becomes critical for systems containing extended conjugation such as polyenes and other conducting polymers, porphyrins, chlorophylls, etc. A new density functional, a Coulomb-attenuated hybrid exchange-correlation functional (CAM-B3LYP), has recently been developed specifically to overcome these limitations, and it has been shown to properly predict molecular charge-transfer spectra. Here, we demonstrate that it predicts qualitatively reasonable spectra for porphyrin, some oligoporphyrins, and chlorophyll. However, alternate density functionals developed to overcome the same limitations such as currentdensity functional theory are shown, in their present implementation, to remain inadequate. The CAM-B3LYP results are shown to be in excellent agreement with complete-active-space plus second-order M011er - Plesset perturbation theory and symmetry-adapted cluster configuration interaction calculations: These depict the N and higher bands of porphyrins and chlorophylls as being charge-transfer bands associated with localization of molecular orbitals on individual pyrrole rings. The validity of the basic Gouterman model for the spectra of porphyrins and chlorophylls is confirmed, rejecting modern suggestions that non-Gouterman transitions lie close in energy to the Q-bands of chlorophylls. As porphyrins and chlorophylls provide useful paradigms for problems involving extended conjugation, the results obtained suggest that many significant areas of nanotechnology and biotechnology may now be realistically treated by cost-effective density-functional-based computational methods. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Coupled-electron pair approximations (CEPAs) and coupled-pair functionals (CPFs) have been popular in the 1970s and 1980s and have yielded excellent results for small molecules. Recently, interest in CEPA and CPF methods has been renewed. It has been shown that these methods lead to competitive thermochemical, kinetic, and structural predictions. They greatly surpass second order M{\o}ller-Plesset and popular density functional theory based approaches in accuracy and are intermediate in quality between CCSD and CCSD(T) in extended benchmark studies. In this work an efficient production level implementation of the closed shell CEPA and CPF methods is reported that can be applied to medium sized molecules in the range of 50-100 atoms and up to about 2000 basis functions. The internal space is spanned by localized internal orbitals. The external space is greatly compressed through the method of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) that was also introduced by the pioneers of the CEPA approaches. Our implementation also makes extended use of density fitting (or resolution of the identity) techniques in order to speed up the laborious integral transformations. The method is called local pair natural orbital CEPA (LPNO-CEPA) (LPNO-CPF). The implementation is centered around the concepts of electron pairs and matrix operations. Altogether three cutoff parameters are introduced that control the size of the significant pair list, the average number of PNOs per electron pair, and the number of contributing basis functions per PNO. With the conservatively chosen default values of these thresholds, the method recovers about 99.8{\%} of the canonical correlation energy. This translates to absolute deviations from the canonical result of only a few kcal mol-1. Extended numerical test calculations demonstrate that LPNO-CEPA (LPNO-CPF) has essentially the same accuracy as parent CEPA (CPF) methods for thermochemistry, kinetics, weak interactions, and potential energy surfaces but is up to 500 times faster. The method performs best in conjunction with large and flexible basis sets. These results open the way for large-scale chemical applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The accurate evaluation of weak noncovalent interactions in large, that is those containing up to thousand atoms, molecular systems represents a difficult challenge for any quantum chemical method. Indeed, some approximations are often introduced to render affordable these calculations. Here, we consider the PBE-QIDH/DH-SVPD protocol, combining a nonempirical double hybrid functional (PBE-QIDH) with a small basis set (DH-SVPD) tailored for noncovalent interactions with a double aim: (i) explore the robustness and accuracy of this protocol with respect to other Density Functional Approximations; (ii) illustrate how its performances are affected by the computational parameters underlying the calculation of the exact exchange and the Coulomb contribution, as well as the perturbative term. To this end, we consider three data sets, namely S66, L7, and CiM13, incorporating molecules of increasing size. On the bright side, our results suggest that the PBE-QIDH/DH-SVPD protocol is particularly accurate for large systems such as those contained in the CiM13 set (up to more than 1000 atoms and 14 000 basis functions), for which the DLPNO approximation leads to a significant speed-up for the evaluation of the perturbative correlation term. However, our analysis also points out the limit of this statistical exercise, when the quality of the reference data cannot be easily assessed, due to the size of the molecular complexes involved, and when the number of molecules is limited.},

abstract = {Formal and computational aspects are discussed for a self-consistent treatment of spin-orbit coupling within the two-component generalization of the Hartree-Fock theory. A molecular implementation into the CRYSTAL program is illustrated, where the standard one-component code (typical of Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham spin-unrestricted methodologies) is extended to work in terms of two-component spinors. When passing from a one- to a two-component description, the Fock and density matrices become complex. Furthermore, apart from the $\alpha$$\alpha$ and $\beta$$\beta$ diagonal spin blocks, one has also to deal with the $\alpha$$\beta$ and $\beta$$\alpha$ off-diagonal spin blocks. These latter blocks require special care as, for open-shell electronic configurations, certain constraints of the one-component code have to be relaxed. This formalism intrinsically allows us to treat local magnetic torque as well as noncollinear magnetization and orbital current-density. An original scheme to impose a specified noncollinear magnetization on each atomic center as a starting guess to the self-consistent procedure is presented. This approach turns out to be essential to surpass local minima in the rugged energy landscape and allows possible convergence to the ground-state solution in all of the discussed test cases.},

The definiteness of the Mulliken and Dirac electron repulsion integral (ERI) matrices is examined for different classes of resolution-of-the-identity (RI) ERI approximations with particular focus on local fitting techniques. For global RI, robust local RI, and nonrobust local RI we discuss the definiteness of the approximated ERI matrices as well as the resulting bounds of Hartree, exchange, and total energies. Lower bounds of Hartree and exchange energy contributions are crucial as their absence may lead to variational instabilities, causing severe convergence problems or even convergence to a spurious state in self-consistent-field optimizations. While the global RI approximation guarantees lower bounds of Hartree and exchange energies, local RI approximations are generally unbounded. The robust local RI approximation guarantees a lower bound of the exchange energy but not of the Hartree energy. The nonrobust local RI approximation guarantees a lower bound of the Hartree energy but not of the exchange energy. These issues are demonstrated by sample calculations on carbon dioxide and benzene using the pair atomic RI approximation.},

This is achieved by calculating the polarizability and self-energy in the real-space and imaginary-time domains. The transformation from the imaginary time to the frequency domain is done by an efficient discrete Fourier transformation with only a few nonuniform grid points. Fast Fourier transformations are used to go from real space to reciprocal space and vice versa. The analytic continuation from the imaginary to the real frequency axis is performed by exploiting Thiele's reciprocal difference approach. Finally, the method is applied successfully to predict the quasiparticle energies and spectral functions of typical semiconductors (Si, GaAs, SiC, and ZnO), insulators (C, BN, MgO, and LiF), and metals (Cu and SrVO3). The results are compared with conventional GW calculations. Good agreement is achieved, highlighting the strength of the present method.},

We study here the ground and excited state properties of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric models of the special chlorophyll/bacteriochlorophyll (Chl/BChl) pigment (P) centers P700 and P680/P870 of type I and type II photosystems, respectively. In the excited state calculations, we study the performance of the algebraic diagrammatic construction through second-order (ADC(2)) method in combination with the reduced virtual space (RVS) approach and the recently developed Laplace-transformed scaled-opposite-spin (LT-SOS) algorithm, which allows us, for the first time, to address multimeric effects at correlated ab initio levels using large basis sets. At the LT-SOS-RVS-ADC(2)/def2-TZVP level, we obtain vertical excitation energies (VEEs) of 2.00-2.07 and 1.52-1.62 eV for the P680/P700 and the P870 pigment models, respectively, which agree well with the experimental absorption maxima of 1.82, 1.77, and 1.43 eV for P680, P700, and P870, respectively. In the P680/P870 models, we find that the photoexcitation leads to a $\pi$ → $\pi$∗ transition in which the exciton is delocalized between the adjacent Chl/BChl molecules of the central pair, whereas the exciton is localized to a single chlorophyll molecule in the P700 model. Consistent with experiments, the calculated excitonic splittings between the central pairs of P680, P700, and P870 models are 80, 200, and 400 cm-1, respectively. The calculations show that the electron affinity of the radical cation of the P680 model is 0.4 V larger than for the P870 model and 0.2 V larger than for P700. The chromophore stacking interaction is found to strongly influence the electron localization properties of the light-absorbing pigments, which may help to elucidate mechanistic details of the charge separation process in type I and type II photosystems.},

Their photophysics relies on the microenvironment, with regard to transition energies as well as quenching of triplet states. Here, we firmly establish the splitting of the Q and Soret bands into x- and y- polarized bands for the isolated molecules in vacuo, and resolve vibronic features. Storage-ring experiments reveal that dissociation of photoexcited charge-tagged complexes occurs over several milliseconds, but with two different time constants. A fast decay is ascribed to dissociation after internal conversion and a slow decay to the population of a triplet state that acts as a bottleneck.

abstract = {Calculations of exact-exchange (EXX) and random phase approximation (RPA)-correlation energies within the formally exact adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem formalism have recently been carried out for a number of isolated and condensed systems. Unfortunately, most of the applications have been done in a non-self-consistent procedure, and for several systems it has been found that RPA correlation energies may significantly depend on the choice of input single-particle wave functions. In this work, we develop an efficient approach to compute the EXX/RPA total energy self-consistently. We derive an expression for the RPA self-consistent potential based on the density functional perturbation theory and dielectric matrix approaches and implemented it within the plane-wave pseudopotential framework. The efficiency of this approach is greatly improved by exploiting an iterative procedure to compute the inverted Kohn-Sham density-density response function. We apply our implementation to study the binding energy curves and the structural properties of rare gasses such as Ar and Kr and alkaline-earth Be dimers. In addition, the EXX and RPA-correlation potentials of these systems at different dissociation distances are analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

Electronic states, total energies, as well as atom forces (used to obtain equilibrium geometries) are computed with the ab initio full-potential linear augmented plane wave method. The (Formula presented) surface is modeled by periodic single layers in a repeated slab geometry, which is justified by the weak electronic interlayer coupling found in the bulk calculations. The electronic structure of the (Formula presented) single-layer slabs, represented by their valence densities of states (DOS) and its atom contributions, is compared with results of bulk (Formula presented) and with previous results obtained by DFT surface cluster studies. The comparison yields good qualitative agreement between the different approaches, which confirms the local nature of interatomic binding in (Formula presented) Further, the computed valence DOS is used to interpret recent experimental results from photoemission on (Formula presented) which suggests that differently coordinated oxygen sites at the surface can be identified in the spectrum.

Both schemes show considerable improvement in the accuracy of the calculated band gaps as compared to the self-consistent GW approach (scGW) and to the self-consistent quasiparticle GW approach (QSGW).

abstract = {Domain based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster theory with single-, double-, and perturbative triple excitations (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) is a highly efficient local correlation method. It is known to be accurate and robust and can be used in a black box fashion in order to obtain coupled cluster quality total energies for large molecules with several hundred atoms. While previous implementations showed near linear scaling up to a few hundred atoms, several nonlinear scaling steps limited the applicability of the method for very large systems. In this work, these limitations are overcome and a linear scaling DLPNO-CCSD(T) method for closed shell systems is reported. The new implementation is based on the concept of sparse maps that was introduced in Part I of this series [P. Pinski, C. Riplinger, E. F. Valeev, and F. Neese, J. Chem. Phys. 143, 034108 (2015)]. Using the sparse map infrastructure, all essential computational steps (integral transformation and storage, initial guess, pair natural orbital construction, amplitude iterations, triples correction) are achieved in a linear scaling fashion. In addition, a number of additional algorithmic improvements are reported that lead to significant speedups of the method. The new, linear-scaling DLPNO-CCSD(T) implementation typically is 7 times faster than the previous implementation and consumes 4 times less disk space for large three-dimensional systems. For linear systems, the performance gains and memory savings are substantially larger. Calculations with more than 20 000 basis functions and 1000 atoms are reported in this work. In all cases, the time required for the coupled cluster step is comparable to or lower than for the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, even if this is carried out with the efficient resolution-of-the-identity and chain-of-spheres approximations. The new implementation even reduces the error in absolute correlation energies by about a factor of two, compared to the already accurate previous implementation.},

The projection operators form a resolution of the identity which may be used to split the Hilbert space into orthogonal and noninteracting subspaces of infinite order. The question of the splitting of the conventional secular equations is discussed, and the explicit form of the decomposed equation is derived in terms of the convolution algebra and the characters.

The use of very large basis sets ( quintuple-zeta) or extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit is necessary to obtain a reliable estimate of the binding energy for these systems. Counterpoise corrected results converge to the same CBS limit, but counterpoise correction without extrapolation is insufficient. Core-valence correlations do not play a significant role. For medium- and short-range correlation, quadruple-zeta results are essentially converged, as demonstrated for relative alkane conformer energies, reaction energies dominated by intramolecular dispersion, isomerization energies, and reaction energies of small organic molecules. Except for weakly bound systems, diffuse augmentation almost universally slows down basis set convergence.

abstract = {We introduce new functionals for the Kohn-Sham correlation energy that are based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem and are named $\sigma$-functionals. Like in the well-established direct random phase approximation (dRPA), $\sigma$-functionals require as input exclusively eigenvalues $\sigma$ of the frequency-dependent KS response function. In the new functionals, functions of $\sigma$ replace the $\sigma$-dependent dRPA expression in the coupling-constant and frequency integrations contained in the ACFD theorem. We optimize $\sigma$-functionals with the help of reference sets for atomization, reaction, transition state, and non-covalent interaction energies. The optimized functionals are to be used in a post-self-consistent way using orbitals and eigenvalues from conventional Kohn-Sham calculations employing the exchange-correlation functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof. The accuracy of the presented approach is much higher than that of dRPA methods and is comparable to that of high-level wave function methods. Reaction and transition state energies from $\sigma$-functionals exhibit accuracies close to 1 kcal/mol and thus approach chemical accuracy. For the 10 966 reactions of the W4-11RE reference set, the mean absolute deviation is 1.25 kcal/mol compared to 3.21 kcal/mol in the dRPA case. Non-covalent binding energies are accurate to a few tenths of a kcal/mol. The presented approach is highly efficient, and the post-self-consistent calculation of the total energy requires less computational time than a density-functional calculation with a hybrid functional and thus can be easily carried out routinely. $\sigma$-Functionals can be implemented in any existing dRPA code with negligible programming effort.},

abstract = {Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a means of probing the fundamental nature of intermolecular interactions. Low-orders of SAPT (here, SAPT0) are especially attractive since they provide qualitative (sometimes quantitative) results while remaining tractable for large systems. The application of density fitting and Laplace transformation techniques to SAPT0 can significantly reduce the expense associated with these computations and make even larger systems accessible. We present new factorizations of the SAPT0 equations with density-fitted two-electron integrals and the first application of Laplace transformations of energy denominators to SAPT. The improved scalability of the DF-SAPT0 implementation allows it to be applied to systems with more than 200 atoms and 2800 basis functions. The Laplace-transformed energy denominators are compared to analogous partial Cholesky decompositions of the energy denominator tensor. Application of our new DF-SAPT0 program to the intercalation of DNA by proflavine has allowed us to determine the nature of the proflavine-DNA interaction. Overall, the proflavine-DNA interaction contains important contributions from both electrostatics and dispersion. The energetics of the intercalator interaction are are dominated by the stacking interactions (two-thirds of the total), but contain important contributions from the intercalator-backbone interactions. It is hypothesized that the geometry of the complex will be determined by the interactions of the intercalator with the backbone, because by shifting toward one side of the backbone, the intercalator can form two long hydrogen-bonding type interactions. The long-range interactions between the intercalator and the next-nearest base pairs appear to be negligible, justifying the use of truncated DNA models in computational studies of intercalation interaction energies.},

abstract = {Many-body GW calculations have emerged as a standard for the prediction of band gaps, band structures, and optical properties for main-group semiconductors and insulators, but it is not well established how predictive the GW method is in general for transition metal (TM) compounds. Surveying the series of 3d oxides within a typical GW approach using the random-phase approximation reveals mixed results, including cases where the calculated band gap is either too small or too large, depending on the oxidation states of the TM (e.g., FeO/Fe2O3, Cu2O/CuO). The problem appears to originate mostly from a too high average d-orbital energy, whereas the splitting between occupied and unoccupied d symmetries seems to be reasonably accurate. It is shown that augmenting the GW self-energy by an attractive (negative) and occupation-independent on-site potential for the TM d orbitals with a single parameter per TM cation can reconcile the band gaps for different oxide stoichiometries and TM oxidation states. In Cu2O, which is considered here in more detail, standard GW based on wave functions from initial density or hybrid functional calculations yields an unphysical prediction with an incorrect ordering of the conduction bands, even when the magnitude of the band gap is in apparent agreement with experiment. The correct band ordering is restored either by applying the d-state potential or by iterating the wave functions to self-consistency, which both have the effect of lowering the Cu-d orbital energy. While it remains to be determined which improvements over standard GW implementations are needed to achieve an accurate ab initio description for a wide range of transition metal compounds, the application of the empirical on-site potential serves to mitigate the problems specifically related to d states in GW calculations. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

The latter are directly related to the amount of charge transferred from an E donor lone pair orbital to an E′ acceptor $\sigma$∗ orbital, in the sense of a through-space anomeric effect. This leads to a buildup of electron density in the intermonomer region and a distinct pnicogen bond strength order quantitatively assessed via ka. However, the complex binding energy $\Delta$E depends only partly on the pnicogen bond strength as H,E-attractions, H-bonding, dipole-dipole, or multipole-multipole attractions also contribute to the stability of pnicogen bonded dimers. A variation from through-space anomeric to second order hyperonjugative, and skewed $\pi$,$\pi$ interactions is observed. Charge transfer into a $\pi$∗ substituent orbital of the acceptor increases the absolute value of $\Delta$E by electrostatic effects but has a smaller impact on the pnicogen bond strength. A set of 10 dimers obtains its stability from covalent pnicogen bonding whereas all other dimers are stabilized by electrostatic interactions. The latter are quantified by the magnitude of the local intermonomer bending force constants XE{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}E′. Analysis of the frontier orbitals of monomer and dimer in connection with the investigation of electron difference densities, and atomic charges lead to a simple rationalization of the various facets of pnicogen bonding.

abstract = {We perform benchmark calculations of the Bethe-Salpeter vertical excitation energies for the set of 28 molecules constituting the well-known Thiel's set, complemented by a series of small molecules representative of the dye chemistry field. We show that Bethe-Salpeter calculations based on a molecular orbital energy spectrum obtained with non-self-consistent G0W0 calculations starting from semilocal DFT functionals dramatically underestimate the transition energies. Starting from the popular PBE0 hybrid functional significantly improves the results even though this leads to an average -0.59 eV redshift compared to reference calculations for Thiel's set. It is shown, however, that a simple self-consistent scheme at the GW level, with an update of the quasiparticle energies, not only leads to a much better agreement with reference values, but also significantly reduces the impact of the starting DFT functional. On average, the Bethe-Salpeter scheme based on self-consistent GW calculations comes close to the best time-dependent DFT calculations with the PBE0 functional with a 0.98 correlation coefficient and a 0.18 (0.25) eV mean absolute deviation compared to TD-PBE0 (theoretical best estimates) with a tendency to be red-shifted. We also observe that TD-DFT and the standard adiabatic Bethe-Salpeter implementation may differ significantly for states implying a large multiple excitation character.},

abstract = {The chain of spheres (COS) algorithm, as part of the RIJCOSX SCF procedure, approximates the exchange term by performing analytic integration with respect to the coordinates of only one of the two electrons, whereas for the remaining coordinates, integration is carried out numerically. In the present work, we attempt to enhance the efficiency of the method by minimizing numerical errors in the COS procedure. The main idea is based on the work of Friesner and consists of finding a fitting matrix, Q, which leads the numerical and analytically evaluated overlap matrices to coincide. Using Q, the evaluation of exchange integrals can indeed be improved. Improved results and timings are obtained with the present default grid setup for both single point calculations and geometry optimizations. The fitting procedure results in a reduction of grid sizes necessary for achieving chemical accuracy. We demonstrate this by testing a number of grids and comparing results to the fully analytic and the earlier COS approximations. This turns out to be favourable for total and reaction energies, for which chemical accuracy can now be reached with a corresponding ∼30 speedup over the original RIJCOSX procedure for single point energies. Results are slightly less favourable for the accuracy of geometry optimizations, but the procedure is still shown to yield geometries with errors well below the method inherent errors of the employed theoretical framework. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for computing explicitly correlated second- and third-order M{\o}ller-Plesset energies near the basis set limit for large molecules with a cost that scales formally as N(4) with system size N. This is achieved through a hybrid approach where locality is exploited first through orbital specific virtuals (OSVs) and subsequently through pair natural orbitals (PNOs) and integrals are approximated using density fitting. Our method combines the low orbital transformation costs of the OSVs with the compactness of the PNO representation of the doubles amplitude vector. The N(4) scaling does not rely upon the a priori definition of domains, enforced truncation of pair lists, or even screening and the energies converge smoothly to the canonical values with decreasing occupation number thresholds, used in the selection of the PNO basis. For MP2.5 intermolecular interaction energies, we find that 99{\%} of benchmark basis set limit correlation energy contributions are recovered using an aug-cc-pVTZ basis and that on average only 50 PNOs are required to correlate the significant orbital pairs.},

The equations are derived using Laplace-transformed atomic orbital second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory as a starting point. The Z-vector approach is employed for minimizing the number of coupled-perturbed self-consistent-field equations that need to be solved. In addition, the method uses the resolution-of-the-identity approximation with an attenuated Coulomb metric and Cholesky decomposition of pseudo-density matrices. The sparsity in the three-center integrals is exploited with sparse linear algebra approaches, leading to reduced computational cost and memory demands. Test calculations show that the deviations from NMR shifts obtained with canonical MP2 are small if appropriate thresholds are used. The performance of the method is illustrated in calculations on DNA strands and on glycine chains with up to 283 atoms and 2864 basis functions.},

abstract = {The accurate description of long-range electron correlation, most prominently including van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interactions, represents a particularly challenging task in the modeling of molecules and materials. vdW forces arise from the interaction of quantum-mechanical fluctuations in the electronic charge density. Within (semi-)local density functional approximations or Hartree-Fock theory such interactions are neglected altogether. Non-covalent vdW interactions, however, are ubiquitous in nature and play a key role for the understanding and accurate description of the stability, dynamics, structure, and response properties in a plethora of systems. During the last decade, many promising methods have been developed for modeling vdW interactions in electronic-structure calculations. These methods include vdW-inclusive Density Functional Theory and correlated post-Hartree-Fock approaches. Here, we focus on the methods within the framework of Density Functional Theory, including non-local van der Waals density functionals, interatomic dispersion models within many-body and pairwise formulation, and random phase approximation-based approaches. This review aims to guide the reader through the theoretical foundations of these methods in a tutorial-style manner and, in particular, highlight practical aspects such as the applicability and the advantages and shortcomings of current vdW-inclusive approaches. In addition, we give an overview of complementary experimental approaches, and discuss tools for the qualitative understanding of non-covalent interactions as well as energy decomposition techniques. Besides representing a reference for the current state-of-the-art, this work is thus also designed as a concise and detailed introduction to vdW-inclusive electronic structure calculations for a general and broad audience.},

Without excitonic effects, the absorption spectra would have the form of a step function, corresponding to the joint density of states of a parabolic band dispersion in two dimensions. This profile is deformed by a pronounced bound excitonic peak below the continuum onset. The peak is split by spin-orbit interaction in the case of single-layer and (mostly) by interlayer interaction in the case of double-layer and bulk MoS 2. The resulting absorption spectra are thus very similar in the three cases, but the interpretation of the spectra is different.

abstract = {The Clenshaw-Curtis method for numerical integration is extended to semi-infinite ([0, ∞] and infinite [-∞, ∞] intervals. The common framework for both these extensions and for integration on a finite interval is to (1) map the integration domain to l $\epsilon$ [0, $\pi$], (2) compute a Fourier sine or cosine approximation to the transformd integrand via interpolation, and (3) integrate the approximation. The interpolation is most easily performed via the sine or cosine cardinal functions, which are discussed in the appendix. The algorithm is mathematically equivalent to expanding the integrand in (mapped or unmapped) Chebyshev polynomials as done by Clenshaw and Curtis, but the trigonometric approach simplifies the mechanics. Like Gaussian quadrature, the error for the change-of-coordinates Fourier method decreases exponentially with N, the number of grid points, but the generalized Curtis-Clenshaw algorithm is much easier to program than Gaussian quadrature because the abscissas and weights are given by simple, explicit formulas. {\textcopyright} 1987 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {A new local method for the computation of electronic excitation energies of singlet states in extended molecular systems is presented. It is based on the CC2 model and local approximations to the wave functions. In the proposed method the singles excitations are treated nonlocally and local restrictions are imposed on doubles amplitudes only. The accuracy of the new method was tested by calculating several lowest excited states for 14 molecules and comparing them with canonical CC2 values. Deviations of the local excitation energies from the canonical reference values do not exceed 0.05 eV for all test molecules and all states in the lower energy range investigated in this work. The method uses the density-fitting approximation for all two-electron integrals, which considerably simplifies the computational complexity of the individual diagrams. A combination of the local approximations and the powerful density-fitting technique leads to a low-scaling method, capable to treat molecular systems comprised of 100 atoms and more in a basis of a polarized double zeta quality. A test calculation for a system consisting of 127 atoms and 370 active electrons without symmetry is presented to show the efficiency of the new method.},

This new theoretical procedure adds three features to G1 theory [J. Chem. Phys. 90, 5622 (1989)] including a correction for nonadditivity of diffuse-sp and 2df basis set extensions, a basis set extension containing a third d function on nonhydrogen atoms and a second p function on hydrogen atoms, and a modification of the higher level correction. G2 theory is a significant improvement over G1 theory because it eliminates a number of deficiencies present in G1 theory. Of particular importance is the improvement in atomization energies of ionic molecules such as LiF and hydrides such as C2H6, NH 3, N2H4, H2O2, and CH3SH. The average absolute deviation from experiment of atomization energies of 39 first-row compounds is reduced from 1.42 to 0.92 kcal/mol. In addition, G2 theory gives improved performance for hypervalent species and electron affinities of second-row species (the average deviation from experiment of electron affinities of second-row species is reduced from 1.94 to 1.08 kcal/mol). Finally, G2 atomization energies for another 43 molecules, not previously studied with G1 theory, many of which have uncertain experimental data, are presented and differences with experiment are assessed. {\textcopyright} 1991 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The existence of strongly bound excitons is one of the hallmarks of the newly discovered atomically thin semiconductors. While it is understood that the large binding energy is mainly due to the weak dielectric screening in two dimensions, a systematic investigation of the role of screening on two-dimensional (2D) excitons is still lacking. Here we provide a critical assessment of a widely used 2D hydrogenic exciton model, which assumes a dielectric function of the form $\epsilon$(q)=1+2$\pi$$\alpha$q, and we develop a quasi-2D model with a much broader applicability. Within the quasi-2D picture, electrons and holes are described as in-plane point charges with a finite extension in the perpendicular direction, and their interaction is screened by a dielectric function with a nonlinear q dependence which is computed ab initio. The screened interaction is used in a generalized Mott-Wannier model to calculate exciton binding energies in both isolated and supported 2D materials. For isolated 2D materials, the quasi-2D treatment yields results almost identical to those of the strict 2D model, and both are in good agreement with ab initio many-body calculations. On the other hand, for more complex structures such as supported layers or layers embedded in a van der Waals heterostructure, the size of the exciton in reciprocal space extends well beyond the linear regime of the dielectric function, and a quasi-2D description has to replace the 2D one. Our methodology has the merit of providing a seamless connection between the strict 2D limit of isolated monolayer materials and the more bulk-like screening characteristics of supported 2D materials or van der Waals heterostructures.},

In a DEC calculation, the full molecular correlated calculation is replaced by a set of independent fragment calculations each using a subset of the total orbital space. The number of independent fragment calcu-lations scales linearly with the system size, rendering the method linear-scaling and massively paral-lel. The DEC-RI-MP2 method can be viewed as an approximation to the DEC-MP2 method where the RI approximation is utilized in each fragment calculation. The individual fragment calculations scale with the fifth power of the fragment size for both methods. However, the DEC-RI-MP2 method has a reduced prefactor compared to DEC-MP2 and is well-suited for implementation on massively parallel supercomputers, as demonstrated by test calculations on a set of medium-sized molecules. The DEC error control ensures that the standard RI-MP2 energy can be obtained to the predefined precision. The errors associated with the RI and DEC approximations are compared, and it is shown that the DEC-RI-MP2 method can be applied to systems far beyond the ones that can be treated with a conventional RI-MP2 implementation.

abstract = {When solving the Moller-Plesset second order perturbation theory (MP2) equations for periodic systems using a local-correlation approach [J. Chem. Phys. 122 (2005) 094113], the computational bottleneck is represented by the evaluation of the two-electron Coulomb interaction integrals between product distributions, each involving a Wannier function and a projected atomic orbital. While for distant product distributions a multipolar approximation performs very efficiently, the four index transformation for close-by distributions, which by far constitutes the bottleneck of correlated electronic structure calculations of crystals, can be avoided through the use of density fitting techniques. An adaptation of that scheme to translationally periodic systems is described, based on Fourier transformation techniques. The formulas and algorithms adopted allow the point symmetry of the crystal to be exploited. Problems related to the possible divergency of lattice sums of integrals involving fitting functions are identified and eliminated through the use of Poisson transformed fitting functions and of dipole-corrected product distributions. The iterative scheme for solving the linear local MP2 (LMP2) equations is revisited. Prescreening in the evaluation of the residual matrix is introduced, which significantly lowers the scaling of the LMP2 equations.},

Some properties can be exactly described within an effective one-particle theory, like principal ionization potentials and electron affinities. This fact can be used to develop equations for a correlated orbital theory (COT) that guarantees a correct one-particle energy spectrum. They are built upon a coupled-cluster based frequency independent self-energy operator presented here, which distinguishes the approach from Dyson theory. The COT also offers an alternative to Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT), whose objective is to represent the electronic density exactly as a single determinant, while paying less attention to the energy spectrum. For any estimate of two-electron terms COT offers a litmus test of its accuracy for principal Ip's and Ea's.

abstract = {Protein-embedded chromophores are responsible for light harvesting, excitation energy transfer, and charge separation in photosynthesis. A critical part of the photosynthetic apparatus are reaction centers (RCs), which comprise groups of (bacterio)chlorophyll and (bacterio)pheophytin molecules that transform the excitation energy derived from light absorption into charge separation. The lowest excitation energies of individual pigments (site energies) are key for understanding photosynthetic systems, and form a prime target for quantum chemistry. A major theoretical challenge is to accurately describe the electrochromic (Stark) shifts in site energies produced by the inhomogeneous electric field of the protein matrix. Here, we present large-scale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations of electrochromic shifts for the RC chromophores of photosystem II (PSII) using various quantum chemical methods evaluated against the domain-based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) implementation of the similarity-transformed equation of motion coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations (STEOM-CCSD). We show that certain range-separated density functionals ($\omega$B97, $\omega$B97X-V, $\omega$B2PLYP, and LC-BLYP) correctly reproduce RC site energy shifts with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The popular CAM-B3LYP functional underestimates the shifts and is not recommended. Global hybrid functionals are too insensitive to the environment and should be avoided, while nonhybrid functionals are strictly nonapplicable. Among the applicable approximate coupled cluster methods, the canonical versions of CC2 and ADC(2) were found to deviate significantly from the reference results both for the description of the lowest excited state and for the electrochromic shifts. By contrast, their spin-component-scaled (SCS) and particularly the scale-opposite-spin (SOS) variants compare well with the reference DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD and the best range-separated DFT methods. The emergence of RC excitation asymmetry is discussed in terms of intrinsic and protein electrostatic potentials. In addition, we evaluate a minimal structural scaffold of PSII, the D1-D2-CytB559 RC complex often employed in experimental studies, and show that it would have the same site energy distribution of RC chromophores as the full PSII supercomplex, but only under the unlikely conditions that the core protein organization and cofactor arrangement remain identical to those of the intact enzyme.},

abstract = {ConspectusThe prediction and interpretation of structural properties are the starting points for a deep understanding of thermochemistry, kinetics, and spectroscopic signatures of molecular systems. To give an example, detailed knowledge of the conformational behavior of the main building blocks of biomolecules in the gas phase (i.e., without the perturbing effect of the environment) is a mandatory prerequisite toward the understanding of the role played by different interactions in determining the biological activity in terms of structure-activity relationships. The first step to take is an unambiguous definition of molecular structure. We address the so-called Born-Oppenheimer equilibrium structure, which is defined in a rigorous manner and isotopically independent, and the target accuracy. For the latter, we aim at so-called "spectroscopic" accuracy, which implies uncertainties of a few milliangstroms for bond lengths and smaller than a tenth of degree for angles.If on one side the continuous enhancements of the experimental techniques give access to new and unprecedented spectroscopic determinations, on the other side they require increasing efforts for an unbiased interpretation and analysis. Among the pieces of information, accurate molecular structures play a particularly important role. Indeed, there is a strong relationship between the experimental outcome and the electronic structure of the system. Spectroscopic techniques, in particular those exploited in the gas phase, are therefore accurate and reliable sources for structural information. However, it is seldom straightforward to derive molecular structures directly from the experimental information. Indeed, even in the favorable case of investigations in the gas phase, vibrational effects are always present, and disentangling their contributions requires collection of information for all vibrational modes, a nearly impossible task. To overcome these limitations, joint theory-spectroscopy strategies can be identified, which are referred to as "top-down" and "bottom-up". The first approach, denoted as the semiexperimental approach, relies on extracting from experimental outcomes the equilibrium structure by using quantum-chemical computations to recover vibrational effects. The bottom-up approach consists in verifying the computed equilibrium geometry by means of a comparison between calculated and experimental spectroscopic parameters that probe structural characteristics.In this contribution, we try to review the most important challenges in accurate molecular structure determinations, with particular emphasis on the "solution" provided by a joint theoretical-experimental approach and on the current state of the art. Starting from the illustration of different strategies, we proceed by addressing the increasing complexity in the derivation of equilibrium geometries: we start from the construction of a database of accurate structures, we then face the problem of extending the dimension of the systems amenable to accurate structural determinations, and finally we move to the challenge of understanding the nature of intermolecular interactions.},

abstract = {A unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) form for the wavefunction in the variational quantum eigensolver has been suggested as a systematic way to go beyond the mean-field approximation and include electron correlation in solving quantum chemistry problems on a quantum computer. Although being exact in the limit of including all possible coupled-cluster excitations, practically, the accuracy of this approach depends on how many and what kind of terms are included in the wavefunction parametrization. Another difficulty of UCC is a growth of the number of simultaneously entangled qubits even at the fixed fermionic excitation rank. Not all quantum computing architectures can cope with this growth. To address both problems we introduce a qubit coupled-cluster (QCC) method that starts directly in the qubit space and uses energy response estimates for ranking the importance of individual entanglers for the variational energy minimization. Also, we provide an exact factorization of a unitary rotation of more than two qubits to a product of two-qubit unitary rotations. Thus, the QCC method with the factorization technique can be limited to only two-qubit entanglement gates and allows for very efficient use of quantum resources in terms of the number of coupled-cluster operators. The method performance is illustrated by calculating ground-state potential energy curves of H{\$}{\_}2{\$} and LiH molecules with chemical accuracy, {\$}\backslashle 1{\$} kcal/mol.},

In practice, the GW approximation is generally evaluated perturbatively, based on a prior self-consistent calculation within a simpler approximation. The final result thus depends on the choice of the self-consistent mean-field chosen as a starting point. Using a recently developed GW code based on Gaussian basis functions, we benchmark a wide range of starting points for perturbative GW, including Hartree-Fock, LDA, PBE, PBE0, B3LYP, HSE06, BH{\&}HLYP, CAM-B3LYP, and tuned CAM-B3LYP. In the evaluation of the ionization energy, the hybrid functionals are clearly superior results starting points when compared to Hartree-Fock, to LDA, or to the semilocal approximations. Furthermore, among the hybrid functionals, the ones with the highest proportion of exact-exchange usually perform best. Finally, the reliability of the frozen-core approximation, that allows for a considerable speed-up of the calculations, is demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

The foundation in the development of TDDFT is the derivation of Runge-Gross theorem and the subsequent formulation of a time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations. For most valence-excited states, lying below the first ionization potential, TDDFT yields results with high accuracy at relatively low computational cost in comparison with highly accurate methods such as MRCI,CASPT2, or EOM-CCSD, which are applicable only to small molecules up to 20 atoms.},

abstract = {We present a linear-scaling symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) method that is based on an atomic orbital (AO) formulation of zeroth-order SAPT (SAPT0). The non-dispersive terms are realized with linear-scaling cost using both the continuous fast multipole method (CFMM) and the linear exchange (LinK) approach for integral contractions as well as our efficient Laplace-based coupled-perturbed self-consistent field method (DL-CPSCF) for evaluating response densities. The reformulation of the dispersion term is based on our linear-scaling AO Mo̸ller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory (AO-MP2) method, that uses our recently introduced QQR-type screening [S. A. Maurer, D. S. Lambrecht, J. Kussmann, and C. Ochsenfeld, J. Chem. Phys. 138, 014101 (2013)] for preselecting numerically significant energy contributions. Similar to scaled opposite-spin MP2, we neglect the exchange-dispersion term in SAPT and introduce a scaling factor for the dispersion term, which compensates for the error and at the same time accounts for basis set incompleteness effects and intramonomer correlation. We show in extensive benchmark calculations that the new scaled-dispersion (sd-)SAPT0 approach provides reliable results for small and large interacting systems where the results with a small 6-31G** basis are roughly comparable to supermolecular MP2 calculations in a triple-zeta basis. The performance of our method is demonstrated with timings on cellulose fragments, DNA systems, and cutouts of a protein-ligand complex with up to 1100 atoms on a single computer core.},

By constructing a GGA which leads to superior atomic exchange energies compared to all GGAs heretofore but does not reproduce the asymptotic form of the exact exchange energy density it is demonstrated that this property is not important for obtaining extremely accurate atomic exchange energies. We conclude that GGAs by their very concept are not suited to reproduce these asymptotic properties of finite systems.

abstract = {We investigate the performance of the range-separated hybrid (RSH) scheme, which combines long-range Hartree-Fock (HF) and a short-range density-functional approximation (DFA), for calculating the photoexcitation/photoionization spectra of the H and He atoms, using a B-spline basis set in order to correctly describe the continuum part of the spectra. The study of these simple systems allows us to quantify the influence on the spectra of the errors coming from the short-range exchange-correlation DFA and from the missing long-range correlation in the RSH scheme. We study the differences using the long-range HF exchange (nonlocal) potential and the long-range exact exchange (local) potential. Contrary to the former, the latter supports a series of Rydberg states and gives reasonable photoexcitation/photoionization spectra, even without applying linear-response theory. The most accurate spectra are obtained with the linear-response time-dependent RSH (TDRSH) scheme. In particular, for the He atom at the optimal value of the range-separation parameter, TDRSH gives slightly more accurate photoexcitation and photoionization spectra than the standard linear-response time-dependent HF. More generally, this work shows the potential of range-separated density-functional theory for calculating linear and nonlinear optical properties involving continuum states.},

Our calculations show that the conformational energy differences obtained with CIM-RI-MP2 and GEBF-MP2 are very close to each other.

Our test calculations reveal that HOSVD transformed amplitudes yield considerably faster convergence in MP2 correlation energy, both in terms of amplitude and orbital truncation. Also, HOSVD orbitals display increased bonding/antibonding character compared to Hartree-Fock orbitals. In contrast to canonical MP2 theory, the leading amplitudes are those between corresponding occupied-virtual orbital pairs. The HOSVD orbitals are paired up automatically around the Fermi level in decreasing importance, so that the strongest occupied virtual-pair are the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. We show that in the case of MP2 amplitudes, the HOSVD orbitals are equivalent to the unrelaxed MP2 natural orbitals. The least squares higher order orthogonal iteration algorithm yields only minor improvements over the sub-optimal truncated orbital space obtained from the HOSVD. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {A formal procedure to construct the contributions to the frequency-dependent density-density (potential-density) response function in a series expansion with respect to the coupling constant of the electrons is presented. The required input quantities are obtained from static perturbation theory along the adiabatic connection. The contributions to the response function up to a given order are shown to determine the corresponding contributions in a coupling constant expansion of the frequency-dependent exchange-correlation kernel, the key quantity in time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) in the linear response regime. Both the frequency-dependent response function as well as the exchange-correlation kernel thus are accessible in an order by order fashion. By exploiting the relations between the expansions of the response function and the exchange-correlation kernel, various methods are proposed to calculate the Kohn-Sham correlation energy via the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem, including a hierarchy of ACFD methods towards the exact Kohn-Sham correlation energy. For a recently introduced ACFD method relying on a truncated power series approximation of the correlation kernel, a formal justification for the underlying ansatz is provided. The presented formal approach to construct the exchange-correlation kernel in an order by order fashion not only represents a basis for new ACFD methods for the Kohn-Sham correlation energy but additionally is of interest to devise new TDDFT methods in the linear response regime.},

abstract = {Self-consistent vertex corrected GW calculations have been performed to evaluate the equilibrium volume and corresponding bulk modulus of 3d transition metal vanadium. The study demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. The accuracy of the results obtained for vanadium is considerably better as compared to the accuracy of the results obtained with self consistent GW method without vertex corrections. It is shown that vertex corrections are important not only for the self energy, but also for the irreducible polarizability. The contribution to the value of the {\$}\backslashPsi{\$}-functional from the vertex corrections is about 30 times smaller than the contribution from the GW part (correlation only!), suggesting the fast convergence of the expansion in terms of the screened interaction for this material. Consideration of the Ward-Takahashi Identity shows that the first order vertex correction eliminates considerable (about 80$\backslash${\%}) part of the mismatch found in scGW calculations. The remaining small mismatch in the Ward-Takahashi Identity leaves, however, a possibility of the calculated low energy electronic structure being affected by higher order diagrams (not included in this study).},

Comparison with high-level CCSD(T) Coupled-Cluster at the Single Double (Triple) levels and ADC(3) Green's function third order algebraic diagrammatic construction calculations indicates that the standard non-self-consistent G0W0@PBE or G0W0@PBE0 approaches significantly underestimate the ionization energy by about 1.1 eV and 0.5 eV, respectively. Consequently, the related Bethe-Salpeter lowest optical excitations are found to be located much too low in energy when building transitions from a non-self-consistent G0W0 description of the quasiparticle spectrum. Simple self-consistent schemes, with update of the eigenvalues only, are shown to provide a weak dependence on the Kohn-Sham starting point and a much better agreement with reference calculations. The present findings rationalize the theory to experiment possible discrepancies observed in previous G0W0 and Bethe-Salpeter studies of bulk water. The increase of the optical gap with increasing cluster size is consistent with the evolution from gas to dense ice or water phases and results from an enhanced screening of the electron-hole interaction.},

abstract = {The GW approximation is a well-known method to obtain the quasiparticle and spectral properties of systems ranging from molecules to solids. In practice, GW calculations are often employed with many different approximations and truncations. In this work, we describe the implementation of a fully self-consistent GW approach based on the solution of the Dyson equation using a plane wave basis set. Algorithmic, numerical, and technical details of the self-consistent GW approach are presented. The fully self-consistent GW calculations are performed for GaAs, ZnO, and CdS including semicores in the pseudopotentials. No further approximations and truncations apart from the truncation on the plane wave basis set are made in our implementation of the GW calculation. After adopting a special potential technique, a ∼100Ry energy cutoff can be used without the loss of accuracy. We found that the self-consistent GW (sc-GW) significantly overestimates the bulk band gaps, and this overestimation is likely due to the underestimation of the macroscopic dielectric constants. On the other hand, the sc-GW accurately predicts the d-state positions, most likely because the d-state screening does not sensitively depend on the macroscopic dielectric constant. Our work indicates the need to include the high-order vertex term in order for the many-body perturbation theory to accurately predict the semiconductor band gaps. It also sheds some light on why, in some cases, the G0W0 bulk calculation is more accurate than the fully self-consistent GW calculation, because the initial density-functional theory has a better dielectric constant compared to experiments.},

abstract = {In this work, a domain-based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) version of the equation of motion coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations for ionization potentials (IP-EOM-CCSD) equations has been formulated and implemented. The method uses ground state localized occupied and pair natural virtual orbitals and applies the DLPNO machinery to arrive at a linear scaling implementation of the IP-EOM-CCSD method. The accuracy of the method is controllable using ground state truncation parameters. Using default thresholds, the method predicts ionization potential (IP) values with good accuracy (mean absolute error of 0.08 eV). We demonstrate that our code can be used to compute IP values for systems with more than 1000 atoms and 10 000 basis functions.},

@article{Friedrich2019,
abstract = {We develop a tetrahedron method for the Brillouin-zone integration of expressions that vary a lot as a function of energy. The usual tetrahedron method replaces the continuous integral over the Brillouin zone by a weighted sum over a finite number of k points. The weight factors are determined under the assumption that the function to be integrated be linear inside each tetrahedron, so the method works best for functions that vary smoothly over the Brillouin zone. In this paper, we describe a new method that can deal with situations where this condition is not fulfilled. Instead of weight factors, we employ weight functions, defined as piecewise cubic polynomials over energy. Since these polynomials are analytic, any function, also strongly varying ones, can be integrated accurately and piecewise analytically. The method is applied to the evaluation of the GT self-energy using two techniques, analytic continuation and contour deformation. (We also describe a third technique, which is a hybrid of the two. An efficient algorithm for the dilogarithm needed for analytic continuation is formulated in Appendix.) The resulting spectral functions converge very quickly with respect to the k-point sampling.},

Peculiarities of the periodic case with respect to parallel LMP2 implementations in molecular codes, such as the use of translational and point symmetry, impose different strategies in order to achieve good parallel performance. The implementation is benchmarked on a few systems, representing a choice of the most interesting solid state quantum-chemistry problems where the MP2 approach can be decisive. Good parallel efficiency of the algorithms is demonstrated for up to 54 processors. Test systems include a metal organic framework (MOF-5) 3D crystalline structure with a triple-zeta-quality basis set: this is the largest calculation performed so far with 106 atoms, 532 correlated electrons, and 2884 atomic orbitals per unit cell.},

abstract = {Here we present a systematic study on the performance of different GW approaches: G0W0, G0W0 with linearized quasiparticle equation (lin-G0W0), and quasiparticle self-consistent GW (qsGW), in predicting core level binding energies (CLBEs) on a series of representative molecules comparing to Kohn-Sham (KS) orbital energy-based results. KS orbital energies obtained using the PBE functional are 20-30 eV lower in energy than experimental values obtained from X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), showing that any Koopmans-like interpretation of KS core level orbitals fails dramatically. Results from qsGW lead to CLBEs that are closer to experimental values from XPS, yet too large. For the qsGW method, the mean absolute error is about 2 eV, an order of magnitude better than plain KS PBE orbital energies and quite close to predictions from ?SCF calculations with the same functional, which are accurate within ∼1 eV. Smaller errors of ∼0.6 eV are found for qsGW CLBE shifts, again similar to those obtained using ?SCF PBE. The computationally more affordable G0W0 approximation leads to results less accurate than qsGW, with an error of ∼9 eV for CLBEs and ∼0.9 eV for their shifts. Interestingly, starting G0W0 from PBE0 reduces this error to ∼4 eV with a slight improvement on the shifts as well (∼0.4 eV). The validity of the G0W0 results is however questionable since only linearized quasiparticle equation results can be obtained. The present results pave the way to estimate CLBEs in periodic systems where ?SCF calculations are not straightforward although further improvement is clearly needed.},

@article{Singwi1968,
abstract = {The dielectric function of a degenerate electron gas in the random-phase approximation, and the one proposed by Hubbard, which takes exchange effects into account, have been extensively used in the study of metallic properties. However, both dielectric functions lead to an overestimate of the short-range correlations between particles. This is manifest from the fact that the pair-correlation function is negative for small interparticle separations over the whole range of metallic densities, and implies an overestimate of the correlation energy. An improved expression of the dielectric function is given, which includes explicitly, in an approximate way, the short-range correlations arising from both Coulomb and exchange effects by being a functional of the structure factor. The structure factor and the dielectric function can then be determined in a self-consistent manner. The numerical solution of the self-consistent scheme yields a pair-correlation function which is positive for all values of the density up to rs=4. For rs{\textgreater}4, it is very slightly negative at small separations, but it is so small that it can be considered to be zero for all practical purposes. New estimates of the correlation energy are given for the entire metallic density range, and are smaller than the earlier estimates. These results are used to recalculate the cohesive energy of the alkali metals. A discussion of the plasmon dispersion relation, the compressibility, and the liquid-solid transition, both for the electron system and for an astrophysically interesting system of protons over a background of electrons, is also given. {\textcopyright} 1968 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {An efficient new molecular orbital (MO) basis algorithm is reported implementing the pair atomic resolution of the identity approximation (PARI) to evaluate the exact exchange contribution (K) to self-consistent field methods, such as hybrid and range-separated hybrid density functionals. The PARI approximation, in which atomic orbital (AO) basis function pairs are expanded using auxiliary basis functions centered only on their two respective atoms, was recently investigated by Merlot et al. [J. Comput. Chem. 2013, 34, 1486]. Our algorithm is significantly faster than quartic scaling RI-K, with an asymptotic exchange speedup for hybrid functionals of (1 + X/N), where N and X are the AO and auxiliary basis dimensions. The asymptotic speedup is 2 + 2X/N for range separated hybrids such as CAM-B3LYP, $\omega$B97X-D, and $\omega$B97X-V which include short- and long-range exact exchange. The observed speedup for exchange in $\omega$B97X-V for a C68 graphene fragment in the cc-pVTZ basis is 3.4 relative to RI-K. Like conventional RI-K, our method greatly outperforms conventional integral evaluation in large basis sets; a speedup of 19 is obtained in the cc-pVQZ basis on a C54 graphene fragment. Negligible loss of accuracy relative to exact integral evaluation is demonstrated on databases of bonded and nonbonded interactions. We also demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the PARI-K approximation is variationally stable.},

@article{Klopper2006a,
abstract = {The past few years have seen a particularly rich period in the development of the explicitly correlated R12 theories of electron correlation. These theories bypass the slow convergence of conventional methods, by augmenting the traditional orbital expansions with a small number of terms that depend explicitly on the interelectronic distance r 12 . Amongst the very numerous discoveries and developments that we will review here, two stand out as being of particular interest. First, the fundamental numerical approximations of the R12 methods withstand the closest scrutiny: Kutzelnigg's use of the resolution of the identity and the generalized Brillouin condition to avoid many-electronic integrals remains sound. Second, it transpires that great gains in accuracy can be made by changing the dependence on the interelectronic coordinate from linear ( r 12 ) to some suitably chosen short-range form (e.g., exp(-$\alpha$r12 )). Modern R12 (or F12) methods can deliver MP2 energies (and beyond) that are converged to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol) in triple- or even double-zeta basis sets. Using a range of approximations, applications to large molecules become possible. Here, the major developments in the field are reviewed, and recommendations for future directions are presented. By comparing with commonly used extrapolation techniques, it is shown that modern R12 methods can deliver high accuracy dramatically faster than by using conventional methods. {\textcopyright} 2006 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

Phys. 135, 104111 (2011)] and its efficient implementation at the CC singles and doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] level is presented. The method combines the cluster-in-molecule approach of Li and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 131, 114109 (2009)] with frozen natural orbital (NO) techniques. To break down the unfavorable fifth-power scaling of our original approach a two-level domain construction algorithm has been developed. First, an extended domain of localized molecular orbitals (LMOs) is assembled based on the spatial distance of the orbitals. The necessary integrals are evaluated and transformed in these domains invoking the density fitting approximation. In the second step, for each occupied LMO of the extended domain a local subspace of occupied and virtual orbitals is constructed including approximate second-order Mo̸ller-Plesset NOs. The CC equations are solved and the perturbative corrections are calculated in the local subspace for each occupied LMO using a highly-efficient CCSD(T) code, which was optimized for the typical sizes of the local subspaces. The total correlation energy is evaluated as the sum of the individual contributions. The computation time of our approach scales linearly with the system size, while its memory and disk space requirements are independent thereof. Test calculations demonstrate that currently our method is one of the most efficient local CCSD(T) approaches and can be routinely applied to molecules of up to 100 atoms with reasonable basis sets.},

We present the Chebyshev Accelerated Subspace iteration Eigensolver (ChASE), a modern algorithm and library based on subspace iteration with polynomial acceleration. Novel to ChASE is the computation of the spectral estimates that enter in the filter and an optimization of the polynomial degree that further reduces the necessary floating-point operations. ChASE is written in C++ using the modern software engineering concepts that favor a simple integration in application codes and a straightforward portability over heterogeneous platforms. When solving sequences of Hermitian eigenproblems for a portion of their extremal spectrum, ChASE greatly benefits from the sequence's spectral properties and outperforms direct solvers in many scenarios. The library ships with two distinct parallelization schemes, supports execution over distributed GPUs, and is easily extensible to other parallel computing architectures.},

abstract = {We apply density fitting approximations to generate the 2-electron integrals in local MP2 (LMP2) to produce a method denoted DF-LMP2. The method can equally be seen as a local version of the well-known RI-MP2 method, which in this work is referred to as DF-MP2. Local approximations reduce the asymptotic scaling of computational resources to [script O](N), and the most expensive step of DF-MP2 [the [script O](N5] assembly) is rendered negligible in DF-LMP2. It is demonstrated that for large molecules DF-LMP2 is much faster (1–2 orders of magnitude) than either LMP2 or DF-MP2. The availablility of LMP2, DF-MP2 and DF-LMP2 has for the first time made it possible to assess the accuracy of local and density fitting approximations for extended molecules using cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets. The density fitting errors are found to be consistently small, but the errors arising from local approximations are somewhat larger than expected from calculations on smaller systems. It is proposed to apply local density fitting approximations also for the Fock matrix construction in Hartree-Fock calculations. Preliminary results demonstrate that this can lead to significant savings in the Hartree-Fock calculation.},

We provide two theorems which explain why the methods currently in use usually find the correct solution. These theorems are general enough to cover a large class of similar methods. An efficient algorithm for including self-consistent vertex corrections well beyond GW is described and used in a numerical validation of the two theorems. The effect of a simple mixing scheme on solutions obtained iteratively is also investigated.},

abstract = {We study defect energy levels in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with varying number of layers using a fragment many-body GW formalism, taking as examples the paradigmatic carbon-dimer and CBVN defects. We show that a single layer can be fragmented in polarizable finite-size areas reproducing faithfully the effect of the dielectric environment, dramatically facilitating the study at the many-body level of point defects in the dilute limit. The evolution of defect energy levels from the monolayer to a n-layer system due to increased screening, labeled polarization energies, follow a simple ($\Delta$P/n+P∞) behavior. The coefficients $\Delta$P and P∞ are found to be close to universal, with opposite signs for holes and electrons, characterizing mainly the host and the position of the defect (surface or bulk), but hardly the defect type. Our results rationalize the evolution of defect energy levels with layer number, allowing to safely extrapolate results obtained for the monolayer to few layers, surface, or bulk h-BN. The present many-body fragment approach further opens the door to studying disordered two-dimensional layers.},

abstract = {Second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory using the Resolutionof-the-Identity approximation (RI-MP2) is a state-of-The-Art approach to accurately estimate many-body electronic correlation effects. This is critical for predicting the physicochemical properties of complex molecular systems; however, the scale of these calculations is limited by their extremely high computational cost. In this paper, a novel many-GPU algorithm and implementation of a molecular-fragmentation-based RI-MP2 method are presented that enable correlated calculations on over 180,000 electrons and 45,000 atoms using up to the entire Summit supercomputer in 12 minutes. The implementation demonstrates remarkable speedups with respect to other current GPU and CPU codes, excellent strong scalability on Summit achieving 89.1{\%} parallel efficiency on 4600 nodes, and shows nearly-ideal weak scaling up to 612 nodes. This work makes feasible ab initio correlated quantum chemistry calculations on significantly larger molecular scales than before on both large supercomputing systems and on commodity clusters, with a potential for major impact on progress in chemical, physical, biological and engineering sciences.},

abstract = {Quasiparticle energies are defined as ionization potentials (IP) for occupied orbitals and as electron affinities (EA) for unoccupied orbitals. They correspond to band energies in extended systems. As many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) readily provides energies of any order, we extend the theory to give any order corrections to IPs and EAs for finite and infinite systems, which permits a direct evaluation of correlation corrections. The diagrams for IPs and EAs can be classified into two types. The first type are linked diagrams which can be further separated into two sets. One set consists of the diagrams having one and only one bubble with a fixed index. They mainly account for orbital relaxation effects that are shown to have a finite contribution in infinite periodic systems. The other diagrams are derived from the diagrams for the total energy. In each of those diagrams, there is one and only one line with a fixed index. The second type of diagrams are the diagrams which have two or more lines with fixed indices. Because of mutual cancellations among the contributions of the orbital relaxation and electron correlation, the only remaining diagrams are those which fall apart by switching any two ending vertices of the lines that have fixed indices. These diagrams can be expressed as unlinked diagrams, of which each separated part is a diagram of the first type. Since each unlinked part has one line with a fixed index, these unlinked diagrams are size intensive. The rules to interpret these diagrams are explained. The connection between the first type of diagrams for the MBPT correction and the total self-energy with the diagonal approximation for E = ϵp(0) in propagator or Greens function methods is explicitly established for any order. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

Despite their advanced age, these clones are euglycaemic, insulin sensitive and normotensive. Importantly, we observe no clinical signs of degenerative joint disease apart from mild, or in one case moderate, osteoarthritis in some animals.

abstract = {A benchmark set of 24 isomerization reactions of large organic molecules (consisting of 24 to 81 atoms) is presented (termed ISOL). The molecules are much larger than what is typically considered in thermochemical tests. To obtain reference isomerization energies, complete basis set (CBS) extrapolations at the (SCS)-MP2 level have been computed that are augmented by perturbative third-order corrections (SCS-MP3 and MP2.5 methods). Based on these carefully examined reference data, a diverse set of common density functionals varying from GGA to double-hybrid functional level with and without dispersion correction (DFT-D) is tested. Double-hybrid and the PBE0 hybrid functionals are found to be the methods of choice for the type of main group thermochemistry examined here. For all isomerizations with an average reaction energy of 22.7 kcal mol-1 (in a range between 0.5 and 74.5 kcal mol-1), PBE0-D, B2PLYP-D and B2GP-PLYP-D yield mean absolute deviations of 2.5, 4.1 and 2.9 kcal mol-1. Most importantly it is found that the use of a dispersion correction is essential if such large molecules are considered. For all DFT methods the MAD is lowered very significantly by 1.4-5.0 kcal mol-1 when DFT-D is used. Intramolecular (mainly medium-range) London dispersion interactions account in some cases for more than 50{\%} (41 kcal mol-1) of the isomerization energy even though the size of the systems remains unchanged. This study also demonstrates for the first time clearly that typical DFT errors are larger than expected (about 5 kcal mol-1) and that chemical accuracy (about 1 kcal mol-1) even for these electronically well-behaved molecules is currently not reached by DFT. We propose this new test set as a difficult challenge for electronic structure methods that claim to be routinely applicable to large molecules. We also suggest to use a distance range resolved dispersion energy as a diagnostic for problematic cases in DFT. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies.},

However, the related computational costs are high and thus represent strong limitations to its widespread application. In the present study, we explore two less demanding alternatives for the calculation of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements on the many-body perturbation theory level. Namely, we test the accuracy of the static Coulomb-hole plus screened-exchange (COHSEX) approximation and further of the constant screening approach, where variations of the screened Coulomb potential W upon small changes of the atomic positions along the vibrational eigenmodes are neglected. We find this latter approximation to be the most reliable, whereas the static COHSEX ansatz leads to substantial errors. Our conclusions are validated in a few paradigmatic cases: diamond, graphene, and the C60 fullerene. These findings open the way for combining the present many-body perturbation approach with efficient linear-response theories.},

Second, this separation allows constructing a subspace self-energy, which contains dynamic correlation from only a particular (spatial or energetic) region of interest. The methodology is exemplified on large-scale simulations of nitrogen-vacancy states in a periodic hBN monolayer and hBN-graphene heterostructure. We demonstrate that the deterministic embedding of strongly localized states significantly reduces statistical errors, and the computational cost decreases by more than an order of magnitude. The computed subspace self-energy unveils how interfacial couplings affect electronic correlations and identifies contributions to excited-state lifetimes. While the embedding is necessary for the proper treatment of impurity states, the decomposition yields new physical insight into quantum phenomena in heterogeneous systems.},

We also compare the accuracy of different total energy functionals, which differ when evaluated with a non-self-consistent density or density matrix. While the errors in total energies among different functionals and starting points are small, the individual energy components show noticeable errors when compared to reference data. The energy component errors of ?GW are smaller than functionals of the density and we suggest that the linearized GW density matrix is a route to improving total energy evaluations in the adiabatic connection framework.},

The new method not only improves upon all other tested RPA schemes including the standard post-GKS range-separated RPA for the investigated test cases covering general main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions but also significantly outperforms the popular G0W0 method in estimating the ionization potentials and fundamental gaps considered in this work using the eigenvalue spectra obtained from the GKS Hamiltonian.},

The interaction between the surface charges and the electron density may be calculated by integrating over either the fitted or exact density, or by calculating the molecular potential. A disk-smearing algorithm is applied in the former case to avoid singularities. Several self-consistent field/COSMO coupling schemes were examined in an attempt to reduce computational effort.

To investigate this process, we performed transient absorption experiments at 77 K with various excitation conditions on the isolated Photosystem II reaction center preparations from spinach. The results have been analyzed by global and target analysis and demonstrate that at least two different excited states, (Chl D1PheD1)* and (PD1PD2Chl D1)*, give rise to two different pathways for ultrafast charge separation. We propose that the disorder produced by slow protein motions causes energetic differentiation among reaction center complexes, leading to different charge separation pathways. Because of the low temperature, two excitation energy trap states are also present, generating charge-separated states on long time scales. We conclude that these slow trap states are the same as the excited states that lead to ultrafast charge separation, indicating that at 77 K charge separation can be either activation-less and fast or activated and slow. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

In these calculations we use the finite temperature formalism and calculate the Green's function on the imaginary time axis. This allows for a simple extension to nonequilibrium systems.

abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15{\%}-40{\%} compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10{\%}) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

Dunning basis sets augmented by diffuse functions are employed for all accessible $\zeta$-levels; truncations of the diffuse space are also considered. After examination of both accuracy and performance for 394 model chemistries, SCS(MI)-MP2/cc-pVQZ can be recommended for general use, having good accuracy at low cost and no ill-effects such as imbalance between hydrogen-bonding and dispersion-dominated systems or non-parallelity across dissociation curves. Moreover, when benchmarking accuracy is desirable but gold-standard computations are unaffordable, this work recommends silver-standard [DW-CCSD(T**)-F12/aug-cc-pVDZ] and bronze-standard [MP2C-F12/aug-cc-pVDZ] model chemistries, which support accuracies of 0.05 and 0.16 kcal/mol and efficiencies of 97.3 and 5.5 h for adenine{\textperiodcentered}thymine, respectively.

XYG3 and XYGJ-OS are two widely used xDH functionals that are known to be quite accurate at equilibrium geometries. Here, we show that the XYG3 and XYGJ-OS functionals can be ill behaved for stretched bonds well beyond the Coulson-Fischer point, predicting unphysical dipole moments and humps in potential energy curves for some simple systems like the hydrogen fluoride molecule. Numerical experiments and analysis show that these failures are not due to PT2.

Basis sets of double zeta [4s3p1d], triple zeta [5s4p2d1f], and quadruple zeta [6s5p3d2f1g] quality are defined. Each of these sets is then augmented with diffuse functions to better describe electron affinities and other molecular properties: s and p functions were obtained by optimization for the anion HF energy, while an additional polarization function for each symmetry present in the standard set was optimized for the anion HF+1+2 energy.

Previous research has demonstrated that some approximate density functionals can predict usefully accurate interaction energies for many noncovalent systems; however, most of that work is limited to small and moderate-sized molecules. Very recently though, accurate benchmarks have become available for some very large molecules. The present work applies 21 approximate density functionals to compute the binding energies of seven large molecular systems that have a number of atoms ranging from 200 to 910. The results are judged by comparison to the recently published CIM-DLPNO-CCSD(T) results, which are assumed to provide a reliable benchmark.

abstract = {Low-temperature absorption and CD spectra, measured simultaneously, are reported from Photosystem II (PS II) reduced with sodium dithionite. Spectra were obtained using PS II core complexes before and after photoaccumulation of PheoD1-, the anion of the primary acceptor. For plant PS II, PheoD1- was generated under conditions in which the primary plastoquinone was present as an anion (QA-) and as a modified species taken to be the neutral doubly reduced hydroquinone (Q AH2). The bleaches observed upon PheoD1- formation in the presence of QA- are shifted to the blue compared those in the presence of QAH2- This is attributed to the influence of the charge on QA-, and this effect mirrors the well-known electrochromic effect of QA- on the neutral pigments. The absorption bleaches induced by PheoD1 reduction are species dependent. Structured changes of the CD in the 680-690 nm spectral region are seen upon photoaccumulation of Pheo D1- in PS II from plant, Synechocystis and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus. These CD changes are shown to be consistent with the overall electronic assignments of Raszewski et al. [Raszewski et al. Biophys. J. 2008, 95, 105], which place the dominant PheoD1 excitation near 672 nm. CD changes associated with PheoD1 reduction are modeled to arise from the shift and intensity changes of two CD features: one predominately of ChlD1 character, the other predominately PheoD2 in character. The assignments are also shown to account for the Qy absorption changes in samples where the quinone is its charged (QA-) and neutral (QAH2 states. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

For the latter, an unrestricted AO-based MP2 formulation is introduced. A reduction in the dependency of the computational efficiency on the size of the basis set is achieved by a Cholesky decomposition and the prefactor is reduced by the resolution-of-the-identity approximation. Significant integral contributions are selected based on distance-including integral estimates (denoted as QQR-screening) and its reliability as a fully controlled screening procedure is demonstrated. The rate-determining steps are shown via model computations to scale cubically in the computation of energy gradients and quadratically in the case of hyperfine coupling constants.

We show that using different encodings, the simulation cost can be reduced to O (log m) and a constant, respectively. Nearest neighbors fermionic gates on a graph of bounded degree can be simulated at a constant cost. A universal set of fermionic gates is found.

abstract = {Herein, we present a fragment-based approach for calculating the charged and neutral excited states in molecular systems, based on the many-body Green's function method within the GW approximation and the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE). The implementation relies on the many-body expansion of the total irreducible polarizability on the basis of fragment molecular orbitals. The GW quasi-particle energies in complex molecular environments are obtained by the GW calculation for the target fragment plus induced polarization contributions of the surrounding fragments at the static Coulomb-hole plus screened exchange level. In addition, we develop a large-scale GW/BSE method for calculating the delocalized excited states of molecular aggregates, based on the fragment molecular orbital method and the exciton model. The accuracy of fragment-based GW and GW/BSE methods was evaluated on molecular clusters and molecular crystals. We found that the accuracy of the total irreducible polarizability can be improved systematically by including two-body correction terms, and the fragment-based calculations can reasonably reproduce the results of the corresponding unfragmented calculations with a relative error of less than 100 meV. The proposed approach enables efficient excited-state calculations for large molecular systems with reasonable accuracy.},

abstract = {An efficient procedure is introduced to obtain the basis-set limit in electronic structure calculations of large molecular and ionic clusters. This approach is based on a Boys-Bernardi-style counterpoise correction for clusters containing arbitrarily many monomer units, which is rendered computationally feasible by means of a truncated many-body expansion. This affords a tractable way to apply the sequence of correlation-consistent basis sets (aug-cc-pVXZ) to large systems and thereby obtain energies extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. A three-body expansion with three-body counterpoise corrections is shown to afford errors of {\^{a}}‰0.1-0.2 kcal/mol with respect to traditional MP2/CBS results, even for challenging systems such as fluoride-water clusters. A triples correction, $\delta$CCSD(T) = ECCSD(T) - EMP2, can be estimated accurately and efficiently as well. Because the procedure is embarrassingly parallelizable and requires no electronic structure calculations in systems larger than trimers, it is extendible to very large clusters. As compared to traditional CBS extrapolations, computational time is dramatically reduced even without parallelization. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Within many-body perturbation theory, Hedin's formalism offers a systematic way to iteratively compute the self-energy ς of any dynamically correlated interacting system, provided one can evaluate the interaction vertex $\Gamma$ exactly. This is, however, impossible, in general, for it involves the functional derivative of ς with respect to the Green's function. Here, we analyze the structure of this derivative, splitting it into four contributions and outlining the type of quasiparticle interactions that each of them generate. Moreover, we show how, in the implementation of self-consistency, the action of these contributions can be classified into two: A quantitative renormalization of previously included interaction terms and the inclusion of qualitatively distinct interaction terms through successive functional derivatives of $\Gamma$ itself. Implementing this latter type of self-consistency can extend the validity of perturbative approximations based on Hedin's equations toward the high interaction limit, as we show in the example of the Hubbard dimer. Our analysis also provides a unifying perspective on the perturbation theory landscape, showing how the T-matrix approach is completely contained in Hedin's formalism.},

Lower-cost ab initio methods such as MP2-F12 and CCSD-F12b actually are outperformed by double-hybrid DFT functionals; in particular, the DSD-PBEP86-NL double hybrid performs well enough to serve as a secondary standard. Among range-separated hybrids, $\omega$B97X-V performs well, while B3LYP-D3BJ does surprisingly well among traditional DFT functionals. Treatment of dispersion is important for the DFT functionals; for the YMPJ set, D3BJ generally works as well as the NL nonlocal dispersion functional. Basis set sensitivity for DFT calculations on these conformers is weak enough that def2-TZVP is generally adequate. For conformer corrections to heats of formation, B3LYP-D3BJ and especially DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ or DSD-PBEP86-NL are adequate for all but the most exacting applications. The revised geometries and energetics for the YMPJ database have been made available as Supporting Information and should be useful in the parametrization and validation of molecular mechanics force fields and other low-cost methods. The very recent dRPA75 method yields good performance, without resorting to an empirical dispersion correction, but is still outperformed by DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ and particularly DSD-PBEP86-NL. Core-valence corrections are comparable in importance to improvements beyond CCSD(T*)/cc-pVDZ-F12 in the valence treatment.},

abstract = {The present work proposes to use density-functional theory (DFT) to correct for the basis-set error of wave-function theory (WFT). One of the key ideas developed here is to define a range-separation parameter which automatically adapts to a given basis set. The derivation of the exact equations are based on the Levy-Lieb formulation of DFT, which helps us to define a complementary functional which corrects uniquely for the basis-set error of WFT. The coupling of DFT and WFT is done through the definition of a real-space representation of the electron-electron Coulomb operator projected on a one-particle basis set. Such an effective interaction has the particularity to coincide with the exact electron-electron interaction in the limit of a complete basis set, and to be finite at the electron-electron coalescence point when the basis set is incomplete. The non-diverging character of the effective interaction allows one to define a mapping with the long-range interaction used in the context of range-separated DFT and to design practical approximations for the unknown complementary functional. Here, a local-density approximation is proposed for both full-configuration-interaction (FCI) and selected configuration-interaction approaches. Our theory is numerically tested to compute total energies and ionization potentials for a series of atomic systems. The results clearly show that the DFT correction drastically improves the basis-set convergence of both the total energies and the energy differences. For instance, a sub kcal/mol accuracy is obtained from the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set with the method proposed here when an aug-cc-pV5Z basis set barely reaches such a level of accuracy at the near FCI level.},

In this paper, we present results for the van der Waals bonded Ar2 and Kr2 dimers and demonstrate that the RPAx gives superior dispersion forces as compared to the RPA. We then show that this improved description is crucial for the bond formation of the Mg2 molecule. In addition, the RPAx performs better for the Be2 dissociation curve at large nuclear separation but, similar to the RPA, fails around equilibrium due to the build up of a large repulsion hump. For the strongly correlated LiH molecule at dissociation we have also calculated the RPAx potential and find that the correlation peak at the bond midpoint is overestimated as compared to the RPA and the exact result. The step feature is missing and hence the delocalization error is comparable to the RPA. This is further illustrated by a smooth energy versus fractional charge curve and a poor description of the LiH dipole moment at dissociation.},

The first-principles description of the spectra requires an efficient and accurate treatment of all many-body effects. This is especially challenging for inner valence excitations where the single QP picture breaks down. Here, we provide the full valence spectra of small closed-shell molecules, exploring the independent and interacting quasiparticle regimes, computed with the fully correlated adaptive sampling configuration interaction method. We critically compare these results to calculations with the many-body perturbation theory, based on the GW and vertex corrected GW$\Gamma$ approaches. The latter explicitly accounts for two-QP quantum interactions, which have often been neglected. We demonstrate that for molecular systems, the vertex correction universally improves the theoretical spectra, and it is crucial for the accurate prediction of QPs as well as capturing the rich satellite structures of high-energy excitations. GW$\Gamma$ offers a unified description across all relevant energy scales. Our results suggest that the multi-QP regime corresponds to dynamical correlations, which can be described via perturbation theory.},

abstract = {Three MP2-type electron correlation treatments and standard density functional theory (DFT) approaches are used to predict the heats of formation for a wide variety of different molecules. The SCF and MP2 calculations are performed efficiently using the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation such that large basis set (i.e., polarized valence quadruple-zeta quality) treatments become routinely possible for systems with 50-100 atoms. An atom equivalent scheme that corrects the calculated atomic energies is applied to extract the "real" accuracy of the methods for chemically relevant problems. It is found that the spin-component-scaled MP2 method (SCS-MP2, J. Chem. Phys, 2003, 118, 9095) performs best and provides chemical accuracy (MAD of 1.18 kcal/mol) for a G2/97 test set of molecules. The computationally more economical SOS-MP2 variant, which retains only the opposite-spin part of the correlation energy, is slightly less accurate (MAD of 1.36 kcal/mol) than SCS-MP2. Both spin-component-scaled MP2 treatments perform significantly better than standard MP2 (MAD of 1.77 kcal/mol) and DFT-B3LYP (MAD of 2.12 kcal/mol). These conclusions are supported by results obtained for a second test set of complex systems containing 70 molecules, including charged, strained, polyhalogenated, hypervalent, and large unsaturated species (e.g. C60). For this set, DFT-B3LYP performs badly (MAD of 8.6 kcal/mol) with many errors {\textgreater}10-20 kcal/mol while the spin-component-scaled MP2 methods are still very accurate (MAD of 2.8 and 3.7 kcal/mol, respectively). DFT-B3LYP shows an obvious tendency to underestimate molecular stability as the system size increases. Out of six density functionals tested, the hybrid functional PBE0 performs best. All in all, the SCS-MP2 method, together with large AO basis sets, clearly outperforms current DFT approaches and seems to be the most accurate quantum chemical model that routinely can predict the thermodynamic properties of large main group compounds.},

abstract = {We have been investigating the combination of a short-range density functional approximation with long-range random phase approximation (RPA) correlation, where the direct RPA correlation is constructed using only Coulomb (i.e., not antisymmetrized) two-electron integrals. Our group's recently demonstrated connection between RPA and coupled cluster theory suggests investigating a related method: second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory correlation (MP2) constructed using only Coulomb integrals. This new "JMP2" method is related to the scaled-opposite-spin SOS-MP2 approximation [Y. Jung, R. C. Lochan, A. D. Dutoi and M. Head-Gordon, J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 9793], which is also constructed using only Coulomb integrals. While JMP2 and SOS-MP2 yield identical results for closed shell systems, they have important differences for open shells. We show here that both JMP2 and SOS-MP2 provide a reasonable treatment of long-range correlation when combined with a short-range exchange-correlation functional. Remarkably, JMP2's explicit inclusion of (approximate) like-spin correlation effects provides significant improvements over SOS-MP2 for thermochemistry.},

abstract = {Spectroscopic and optical properties of nanosystems and point defects are discussed within the framework of Green's function methods. We use an approach based on evaluating the self-energy in the so-called GW approximation and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the space of single-particle transitions. Plasmon-pole models or numerical energy integration, which have been used in most of the previous GW calculations, are not used. Fourier transforms of the dielectric function are also avoided. This approach is applied to benzene, naphthalene, passivated silicon clusters (containing more than one hundred atoms), and the F center in LiCl. In the latter, excitonic effects and the 1s→2p defect line are identified in the energy-resolved dielectric function. We also compare optical spectra obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation and by using time-dependent density-functional theory in the local, adiabatic approximation. From this comparison, we conclude that both methods give similar predictions for optical excitations in benzene and naphthalene, but they differ in the spectra of small silicon clusters. As cluster size increases, both methods predict very low cross section for photoabsorption in the optical and near ultraviolet ranges. For the larger clusters, the computed cross section shows a slow increase as a function of photon frequency. Ionization potentials and electron affinities of molecules and clusters are also calculated. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order (Formula presented) operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special “metric” and a special “preconditioning” optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order (Formula presented) scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach (Formula presented). We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {An efficient implementation of the orbital-optimized second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (OO-MP2) within the resolution of the identity (RI) approximation is reported. Both conventional MP2 and spin-component scaled (SCS-MP2) variants are considered, and an extensive numerical investigation of the accuracy of these approaches is presented. This work is closely related to earlier work of Lochan, R. C.; Head-Gordon, M. J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 126. Orbital optimization is achieved by making the Hylleraas functional together with the energy of the reference determinant stationary with respect to variations of the double excitation amplitudes and the molecular orbital rotation parameters. A simple iterative scheme is proposed that usually leads to convergence within 5-15 iterations. The applicability of the method to larger molecules (up to {\~{}}1000-2000 basis functions) is demonstrated. The numerical results show that OO-SCS-MP2 is a major improvement in electronically complicated situations, such as represented by radicals or by transition states where spin contamination often greatly deteriorates the quality of the conventional MP2 and SCS-MP2 methods. The OO-(SCS-)MP2 approach reduces the error by a factor of 3-5 relative to the standard (SCS-)MP2. For closed-shell main group elements, no significant improvement in the accuracy relative to the already excellent SCS-MP2 method is observed. In addition, the problems of all MP2 variants with 3d transition-metal complexes are not solved by orbital optimization. The close relationship of the OO-MP2 method to the approximate second-order coupled cluster method (CC2) is pointed out. Both methods have comparable computational requirements. Thus, the OO-MP2 method emerges as a very useful tool for computational quantum chemistry. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) scheme which variationally minimizes the random phase approximation (RPA) ground-state energy with respect to the GKS one-particle density matrix is put forward. We introduce the notion of functional self-consistent schemes, which vary the one-particle Kohn-Sham (KS) potential entering an explicitly potential-dependent exchange-correlation (XC) energy functional for a given density, and distinguish them from orbital-self-consistent (OSC) schemes, which vary the density, or the orbitals, density matrix, or KS potential generating the density. It is shown that, for explicitly potential-dependent XC functionals, existing OSC schemes such as the optimized effective potential method violate the Hellmann-Feynman theorem for the density, producing a spurious discrepancy between the KS density and the correct Hellmann-Feynman density for approximate functionals. A functional self-consistency condition is derived which resolves this discrepancy by requiring the XC energy to be stationary with respect to the KS potential at fixed density. We approximately impose functional self-consistency by semicanonical projection (sp) of the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof KS Hamiltonian. Variational OSC minimization of the resulting GKS-spRPA energy functional leads to a nonlocal correlation potential whose off-diagonal blocks correspond to orbital rotation gradients, while its diagonal blocks are related to the RPA self-energy at a real frequency. Quasiparticle GW energies are a first-order perturbative limit of the GKS-spRPA orbital energies; the lowest-order change of the total energy captures the renormalized singles excitation correction to RPA. GKS-spRPA orbital energies are found to approximate ionization potentials and fundamental gaps of atoms and molecules more accurately than semilocal density functional approximations (SL DFAs) or G0W0 and correct the spurious behavior of SL DFAs for negative ions. GKS-spRPA energy differences are uniformly more accurate than the SL-RPA ones; improvements are modest for covalent bonds but substantial for weakly bound systems. GKS-spRPA energy minimization also removes the spurious maximum in the SL-RPA potential energy curve of Be2 and produces a single Coulson-Fischer point at ∼2.7 times the equilibrium bond length in H2. GKS-spRPA thus corrects most density-driven errors of SL-RPA, enhances the accuracy of RPA energy differences for electron-pair-conserving processes, and provides an intuitive one-electron GKS picture yielding ionization potentials energies and gaps of GW quality.},

abstract = {This work describes a domain-based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) implementation of the equation of motion coupled cluster method for the computation of electron affinities (EAs) including single and double excitations. Similar to our earlier work on ionization potentials (IPs), the method reported in this study uses the ground state DLPNO framework and extends it to the electron attachment problem. While full linear scaling could not be achieved as in the IP case, leaving the Fock/Koopmans' contributions in the canonical basis and using a tighter threshold for singles PNOs allows us to compute accurate EAs and retain most of the efficiency of the DLPNO technique. Thus as in the IP case, the ground state truncation parameters are sufficient to control the accuracy of the computed EA values, although a new set of integrals for singles PNOs must be generated at the DLPNO integral transformation step. Using standard settings, our method reproduces the canonical results with a maximum absolute deviation of 49 meV for bound states of a test set of 24 molecules. Using the same settings, a calculation involving more than 4500 basis functions, including diffuse functions, takes four days on four cores, with only 48 min spent in the EA module itself.},

abstract = {The performance of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach for the first-principles computation of singlet and triplet excitation energies of small organic, closed-shell molecules has been assessed with respect to the quasiparticle energies used on input, obtained at various levels of GW theory. In the corresponding GW computations, quasiparticle energies have been computed for all orbital levels by means of using full spectral functions. The assessment reveals that, for valence excited states, quasiparticle energies obtained at the levels of eigenvalue-only self-consistent (evGW) or quasiparticle self-consistent theory (qsGW) are required to obtain results of comparable accuracy as in time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) using a hybrid functional such as PBE0. In contrast to TDDFT, however, the BSE approach performs well not only for valence excited states but also for excited states with Rydberg or charge-transfer character. To demonstrate the applicability of the BSE approach, computation times are reported for a set of aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, examples of computations of ordinary photoabsorption and electronic circular dichroism spectra are presented for (C60)2 and C84, respectively.},

There are, however, effects that are not captured in this way, including surprising dependences of the dispersion energy on the number N of atoms and on separation D. Higher level quantum chemical, perturbative, and random-phase approximation (RPA)-like theories can capture these beyond pairwise effects, but at a high computational cost. Very recent simplified RPA-like approaches based on localized oscillators account for the unusual N dependence in a computationally efficient way.

abstract = {In designing organic materials for electronics applications, particularly for organic photovoltaics (OPV), the ionization potential (IP) of the donor and the electron affinity (EA) of the acceptor play key roles. This makes OPV design an appealing application for computational chemistry since IPs and EAs are readily calculable from most electronic structure methods. Unfortunately reliable, high-accuracy wave function methods, such as coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] in the complete basis set (CBS) limit are too expensive for routine applications to this problem for any but the smallest of systems. One solution is to calibrate approximate, less computationally expensive methods against a database of high-accuracy IP/EA values; however, to our knowledge, no such database exists for systems related to OPV design. The present work is the first of a multipart study whose overarching goal is to determine which computational methods can be used to reliably compute IPs and EAs of electron acceptors. This part introduces a database of 24 known organic electron acceptors and provides high-accuracy vertical IP and EA values expected to be within ±0.03 eV of the true non-relativistic, vertical CCSD(T)/CBS limit. Convergence of IP and EA values toward the CBS limit is studied systematically for the Hartree-Fock, MP2 correlation, and beyond-MP2 coupled cluster contributions to the focal point estimates.},

The high accuracy is achieved by utilizing optimized minimax integration schemes and the local Coulomb metric attenuated by the complementary error function for the RI approximation. The memory bottleneck of former atomic orbital (AO)-RI-RPA implementations (Schurkus, H. F.; Ochsenfeld, C. J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 144, 031101 and Luenser, A.; Schurkus, H. F.; Ochsenfeld, C. J. Chem.

Furthermore, we present a parallel implementation of our method, which not only leads to faster RPA correlation energy calculations but also to a scalable decrease in memory requirements, opening the door for investigations of large molecules even on small- to medium-sized computing clusters. Although it is known that AO methods are highly efficient for extended systems, where sparsity allows for reaching the linear-scaling regime, we show that our work also extends the applicability when considering highly delocalized systems for which no linear scaling can be achieved. As an example, the interlayer distance of two covalent organic framework pore fragments (comprising 384 atoms in total) is analyzed.},

Starting from the rigorous time-dependent expression they discuss indeed in which limits the spectrum of a molecule embedded in a solvent, described as a polarizable continuum, can be computed in a time-independent formalism, defining both nonequilibrium and equilibrium limits. In these cases the polarizable continuum model provides a suitable description of the solvent field. By computing the absorption spectra of anthracene in gas phase and of coumarin C153 in gas phase and cyclohexane, and the phosphorescence spectrum of the unsubstituted coumarin in ethanol they show that the method is fast and efficient. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Results from numerical tests of nine approximate exchange-correlation energy functionals are reported for various systems - atoms, molecules, surfaces, and bulk solids. The functional forms can be divided into three categories: (1) the local spin density (LSD) approximation, (2) generalized gradient approximations (GGAs), and (3) meta-GGAs. In addition to the spin densities and their first gradients, the input to a meta-GGA includes other semilocal information such as Laplacians of the spin densities or orbital kinetic energy densities. We present a way to visualize meta-GGA nonlocality which generalizes that for GGA nonlocality, and which stresses the different meta-GGA descriptions of iso-orbital and orbital overlap regions of space. While some of the tested approximations were constructed semiempirically with many parameters fitted to chemical data, others were constructed to incorporate key properties of the exact exchange-correlation energy. The latter functionals perform well for both small and extended systems, with the best performance achieved by a meta-GGA which recovers the correct gradient expansion. While the semiempirical functionals can achieve high accuracy for atoms and molecules, they are typically less accurate for surfaces and solids. {\textcopyright} 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

We benchmark the effects of a vertex approximation ($\Gamma$LDA) and the mean-field starting point in GW and the BSE, performing computations using a real-space, transition-space basis and scalar-relativistic pseudopotentials.

abstract = {Computing the {\$}GW{\$} quasiparticle bandstructure and Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) absorption spectra for materials with spin-orbit coupling has commonly been done by treating {\$}GW{\$} corrections and spin-orbit coupling as separate perturbations to density-functional theory. However, accurate treatment of materials with strong spin-orbit coupling often requires a fully relativistic approach using spinor wavefunctions in the Kohn-Sham equation and {\$}GW{\$}/BSE. Such calculations have only recently become available, in particular for the BSE. We have implemented this approach in the plane-wave pseudopotential {\$}GW{\$}/BSE code BerkeleyGW, which is highly parallelized and widely used in the electronic-structure community. We present reference results for quasiparticle bandstructures and optical absorption spectra of solids with different strengths of spin-orbit coupling, including Si, Ge, GaAs, GaSb, CdSe, Au, and Bi{\$}{\_}2{\$}Se{\$}{\_}3{\$}. The calculated quasiparticle band gaps of these systems are found to agree with experiment to within a few tens of meV. The absorption spectrum of GaSb calculated with the fully-relativistic {\$}GW{\$}-BSE captures the large spin-orbit splitting of peaks in the spectrum. For Bi{\$}{\_}2{\$}Se{\$}{\_}3{\$}, we find a drastic change in the low-energy bandstructure compared to that of DFT, with the fully-relativistic treatment of the {\$}GW{\$} approximation correctly capturing the parabolic nature of the valence and conduction bands after including off-diagonal self-energy matrix elements. We present the detailed methodology, approach to spatial symmetries for spinors, comparison against other codes, and performance compared to spinless {\$}GW{\$}/BSE calculations and perturbative approaches to SOC. This work aims to spur further development of spinor {\$}GW{\$}/BSE methodology in excited-state research software.},

@article{Eshuis2010,
abstract = {The random phase approximation (RPA) is an increasingly popular post-Kohn-Sham correlation method, but its high computational cost has limited molecular applications to systems with few atoms. Here we present an efficient implementation of RPA correlation energies based on a combination of resolution of the identity (RI) and imaginary frequency integration techniques. We show that the RI approximation to four-index electron repulsion integrals leads to a variational upper bound to the exact RPA correlation energy if the Coulomb metric is used. Auxiliary basis sets optimized for second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) calculations are well suitable for RPA, as is demonstrated for the HEAT [A. Tajti, J. Chem. Phys. 121, 11599 (2004)] and MOLEKEL [F. Weigend, Chem. Phys. Lett. 294, 143 (1998)] benchmark sets. Using imaginary frequency integration rather than diagonalization to compute the matrix square root necessary for RPA, evaluation of the RPA correlation energy requires O (N4 log N) operations and O (N3) storage only; the price for this dramatic improvement over existing algorithms is a numerical quadrature. We propose a numerical integration scheme that is exact in the two-orbital case and converges exponentially with the number of grid points. For most systems, 30-40 grid points yield $\mu$H accuracy in triple zeta basis sets, but much larger grids are necessary for small gap systems. The lowest-order approximation to the present method is a post-Kohn-Sham frequency-domain version of opposite-spin Laplace-transform RI-MP2 [J. Jung, Phys. Rev. B 70, 205107 (2004)]. Timings for polyacenes with up to 30 atoms show speed-ups of two orders of magnitude over previous implementations. The present approach makes it possible to routinely compute RPA correlation energies of systems well beyond 100 atoms, as is demonstrated for the octapeptide angiotensin II. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Three new data sets for intermolecular interactions, AHB21 for anion-neutral dimers, CHB6 for cation-neutral dimers, and IL16 for ion pairs, are assembled here, with complete-basis CCSD(T) results for each. These benchmarks are then used to evaluate the accuracy of the single-exchange approximation that is used for exchange energies in symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), and the accuracy of SAPT based on wave function and density-functional descriptions of the monomers is evaluated. High-level SAPT calculations afford poor results for these data sets, and this includes the recently proposed "gold", "silver", and "bronze standards" of SAPT, namely, SAPT2+(3)-$\delta$MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, SAPT2+/aug-cc-pVDZ, and sSAPT0/jun-cc-pVDZ, respectively [ Parker, T. M., et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2014, 140, 094106 ]. Especially poor results are obtained for symmetric shared-proton systems of the form X{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}X{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, for X = F, Cl, or OH. For the anionic data set, the SAPT2+(CCD)-$\delta$MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ method exhibits the best performance, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.3 kcal/mol and a maximum error of 0.7 kcal/mol. For the cationic data set, the highest-level SAPT method, SAPT2+3-$\delta$MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ, outperforms the rest of the SAPT methods, with a MAE of 0.2 kcal/mol and a maximum error of 0.4 kcal/mol. For the ion-pair data set, the SAPT2+3-$\delta$MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ performs the best among all SAPT methods with a MAE of 0.3 kcal/mol and a maximum error of 0.9 kcal/mol. Overall, SAPT2+3-$\delta$MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ affords a small and balanced MAE ({\textless}0.5 kcal/mol) for all three data sets, with an overall MAE of 0.4 kcal/mol. Despite the breakdown of perturbation theory for ionic systems at short-range, SAPT can still be saved given two corrections: a "$\delta$HF" correction, which requires a supermolecular Hartree-Fock calculation to incorporate polarization effects beyond second order, and a "$\delta$MP2" correction, which requires a supermolecular MP2 calculation to account for higher-order induction-dispersion coupling. These corrections serve to remove artifacts introduced by the single exchange approximation in the exchange-induction and exchange-dispersion interactions, and obviate the need for ad hoc scaling of the first- and second-order exchange energies. Finally, some density-functional and MP2-based electronic structure methods are assessed as well, and we find that the best density-functional method for computing binding energies in these data sets is B97M-V/aug-cc-pVTZ, which affords a MAE of 0.4 kcal/mol, whereas complete-basis MP2 affords an MAE of 0.3 kcal/mol.},

In the middle of the 1990's new types of learning algorithms (called support vector machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions for generalization which are more general than those discussed in classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation problems. A more detailed overview of the theory (without proofs) can be found in Vapnik (1995). In Vapnik (1998) one can find detailed description of the theory (including proofs).},

abstract = {The domain based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster method with single-, double-, and perturbative triple excitations (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) is an efficient quantum chemical method that allows for coupled cluster calculations on molecules with hundreds of atoms. Because coupled-cluster theory is the method of choice if high-accuracy is needed, DLPNO-CCSD(T) is very promising for large-scale chemical application. However, the various approximations that have to be introduced in order to reach near linear scaling also introduce limited deviations from the canonical results. In the present work, we investigate how far the accuracy of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method can be pushed for chemical applications. We also address the question at which additional computational cost improvements, relative to the previously established default scheme, come. To answer these questions, a series of benchmark sets covering a broad range of quantum chemical applications including reaction energies, hydrogen bonds, and other noncovalent interactions, conformer energies, and a prototype organometallic problem were selected. An accuracy of 1 kcal/mol or better can readily be obtained for all data sets using the default truncation scheme, which corresponds to the stated goal of the original implementation. Tightening of the three thresholds that control DLPNO leads to mean absolute errors and standard deviations from the canonical results of less than 0.25 kcal/mol ({\textless}1 kJ/mol). The price one has then to pay is an increased computational time by a factor close to 3. The applicability of the method is shown to be independent of the nature of the reaction. On the basis of the careful analysis of the results, three different sets of truncation thresholds (termed LoosePNO, NormalPNO, and TightPNO) have been chosen for black box use of DLPNO-CCSD(T). This will allow users of the method to optimally balance performance and accuracy.},

abstract = {The random phase approximation for the correlation energy functional of the density functional theory has recently attracted renewed interest. Formulated in terms of the Kohn-Sham orbitals and eigenvalues, it promises to resolve some of the fundamental limitations of the local density and generalized gradient approximations, as, for instance, their inability to account for dispersion forces. First results for atoms, however, indicate that the random phase approximation overestimates correlation effects as much as the orbital-dependent functional obtained by a second order perturbation expansion on the basis of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In this contribution, three simple extensions of the random phase approximation are examined; (a) its augmentation by a local density approximation for short-range correlation, (b) its combination with the second order exchange term, and (c) its combination with a partial resummation of the perturbation series including the second order exchange. It is found that the ground state and correlation energies as well as the ionization potentials resulting from the extensions (a) and (c) for closed subshell atoms are clearly superior to those obtained with the unmodified random phase approximation. Quite some effort is made to ensure highly converged data, so that the results may serve as benchmark data. The numerical techniques developed in this context, in particular, for the inherent frequency integration, should also be useful for applications of random phase approximation-type functionals to more complex systems. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Convergence with respect to the size of the k-points sampling grid of the Brillouin zone is the main bottleneck in the calculation of optical spectra of periodic crystals via the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). We tackle this challenge by proposing a double grid approach to k-sampling compatible with the effective Lanczos-based Haydock iterative solution. Our method relies on a coarse k-grid that drives the computational cost, while a dense k-grid is responsible for capturing excitonic effects, albeit in an approximated way. Importantly, the fine k-grid requires minimal extra computation due to the simplicity of our approach, which also makes the latter straightforward to implement. We performed tests on bulk Si, bulk GaAs and monolayer MoS2, all of which produced spectra in good agreement with data reported elsewhere. This framework has the potential of enabling the calculation of optical spectra in semiconducting systems where the efficiency of the Haydock scheme alone is not enough to achieve a computationally tractable solution of the BSE, e.g., large-scale systems with very stringent k-sampling requirements for achieving convergence.},

abstract = {Following up on an earlier preliminary communication (Kozuch and Martin, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2011, 13, 20104), we report here in detail on an extensive search for the most accurate spin-component-scaled double hybrid functionals [of which conventional double hybrids (DHs) are a special case]. Such fifth-rung functionals approach the performance of composite ab initio methods such as G3 theory at a fraction of their computational cost, and with analytical derivatives available. In this article, we provide a critical analysis of the variables and components that maximize the accuracy of DHs. These include the selection of the exchange and correlation functionals, the coefficients of each component [density functional theory (DFT), exact exchange, and perturbative correlation in both the same spin and opposite spin terms], and the addition of an ad-hoc dispersion correction; we have termed these parametrizations "DSD-DFT" (Dispersion corrected, Spin-component scaled, Double-hybrid DFT). Somewhat surprisingly, the quality of DSD-DFT is only mildly dependent on the underlying DFT exchange and correlation components, with even DSD-LDA yielding respectable performance. Simple, nonempirical GGAs appear to work best, whereas meta-GGAs offer no advantage (with the notable exception of B95c). The best correlation components appear to be, in that order, B95c, P86, and PBEc, while essentially any good GGA exchange yields nearly identical results. On further validation with a wider variety of thermochemical, weak interaction, kinetic, and spectroscopic benchmarks, we find that the best functionals are, roughly in that order, DSD-PBEhB95, DSD-PBEP86, DSD-PBEPW91, and DSD-PBEPBE. In addition, DSD-PBEP86 and DSD-PBEPBE can be used without source code modifications in a wider variety of electronic structure codes. Sample job decks for several commonly used such codes are supplied as electronic Supporting Information.},

Koopmans' theorem is here generalized to include correlation effects by using Hubbard's expression for the total energy of a free-electron gas. The resulting one-electron Hamiltonian contains in first-order screened exchange. Hubbard's lowest polarization diagram gives, in addition, part of the screened second-order Coulomb interactions, which is small for metallic densities. Collective terms are also obtained. Comparison with the Bohm-Pines Hamiltonian shows a one-to-one correspondence, but with different cutoff functions in each term. Following Hubbard, we extend the method to include the effects of a periodic potential to first order. The resulting one-electron Hamiltonian provides a convenient and accurate basis for self-consistent energy band calculations including exchange and correlation in metals and semiconductors. {\textcopyright} 1961 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Striving to define very accurate vertical transition energies, we perform both high-level coupled cluster (CC) calculations (up to CCSDTQP) and selected configuration interaction (sCI) calculations (up to several millions of determinants) for 18 small compounds (water, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, hydrogen chloride, dinitrogen, carbon monoxide, acetylene, ethylene, formaldehyde, methanimine, thioformaldehyde, acetaldehyde, cyclopropene, diazomethane, formamide, ketene, nitrosomethane, and the smallest streptocyanine). By systematically increasing the order of the CC expansion, the number of determinants in the CI expansion as well as the size of the one-electron basis set, we have been able to reach near full CI (FCI) quality transition energies. These calculations are carried out on CC3/aug-cc-pVTZ geometries, using a series of increasingly large atomic basis sets systematically including diffuse functions. In this way, we define a list of 110 transition energies for states of various characters (valence, Rydberg, n → $\pi$∗, $\pi$ → $\pi$ ∗, singlet, triplet, etc.) to be used as references for further calculations. Benchmark transition energies are provided at the aug-cc-pVTZ level as well as with additional basis set corrections, in order to obtain results close to the complete basis set limit. These reference data are used to benchmark a series of 12 excited-state wave function methods accounting for double and triple contributions, namely ADC(2), ADC(3), CIS(D), CIS(D∞), CC2, STEOM-CCSD, CCSD, CCSDR(3), CCSDT-3, CC3, CCSDT., and CCSDTQ. It turns out that CCSDTQ yields a negligible difference with the extrapolated CI values with a mean absolute error as small as 0.01 eV, whereas the coupled cluster approaches including iterative triples are also very accurate (mean absolute error of 0.03 eV). Consequently, CCSDT-3 and CC3 can be used to define reliable benchmarks. This observation does not hold for ADC(3) that delivers quite large errors for this set of small compounds, with a clear tendency to overcorrect its second-order version, ADC(2). Finally, we discuss the possibility to use basis set extrapolation approaches so as to tackle more easily larger compounds.},

abstract = {A Laplace-transformed second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) method is presented, which allows to achieve linear scaling of the computational effort with molecular size for electronically local structures. Also for systems with a delocalized electronic structure, a cubic or even quadratic scaling behavior is achieved. Numerically significant contributions to the atomic orbital (AO)-MP2 energy are preselected using the so-called multipole-based integral estimates (MBIE) introduced earlier by us [J. Chem. Phys. 123, 184102 (2005)]. Since MBIE provides rigorous upper bounds, numerical accuracy is fully controlled and the exact MP2 result is attained. While the choice of thresholds for a specific accuracy is only weakly dependent upon the molecular system, our AO-MP2 scheme offers the possibility for incremental thresholding: for only little additional computational expense, the numerical accuracy can be systematically converged. We illustrate this dependence upon numerical thresholds for the calculation of intermolecular interaction energies for the S22 test set. The efficiency and accuracy of our AO-MP2 method is demonstrated for linear alkanes, stacked DNA base pairs, and carbon nanotubes: e.g., for DNA systems the crossover toward conventional MP2 schemes occurs between one and two base pairs. In this way, it is for the first time possible to compute wave function-based correlation energies for systems containing more than 1000 atoms with 10 000 basis functions as illustrated for a 16 base pair DNA system on a single-core computer, where no empirical restrictions are introduced and numerical accuracy is fully preserved.},

In practice, the presence of the transition metal surrounded by carefully designed ligands allows fine-tuning of the emission frequency as well as good efficiency of the device. To support the development of new compounds, experimental measurements are generally compared with absorption and emission spectra obtained from ab initio calculations. The standard approach for these calculations is time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with a hybrid exchange-correlation functional like B3LYP. Because of the size of these compounds, the application of more complex quantum chemistry approaches can be challenging. In this work, we used many-body perturbation theory approaches, in particular the GW approximation with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) implemented in Gaussian basis sets, to calculate the quasiparticle properties and the absorption spectra of six cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes, going beyond TDDFT. In the presented results, we compared standard TDDFT simulations with BSE calculations performed on top of perturbative G0W0 and accounting for eigenvalue self-consistency.

The numerical convergence of the expansion is quantitatively discussed for the nuclear problem where it is shown that the correction arising from the first cluster term involving three particles is less than the leading term by a factor of about 10-4.

Comparison of experimental spectra with quantum-chemical simulations represents a convenient and objective way to extract information on the structure. This has been difficult for such large molecules where approximate theoretical models have to be used. In the present study we applied the Cartesian-coordinate based tensor transfer (CCT) making it possible to extend the density functional theory (DFT) and model spectral intensities of large globular proteins nearly at quantum-chemical precision. Indeed, comparison with experiment provided a better understanding of the dependence of VCD spectral shapes on the geometry, their sensitivity to fine structural details and interactions with the environment. On a model set of globular proteins the simulated spectra correlated well with experimental data and revealed which structural information can (and cannot) be obtained from this kind of spectroscopy. Although the VCD technique has been regarded as being rather insensitive to side-chain variations, we found that the spectra of human and hen lysozyme differing by a few amino acids only are quite distinct. This has been explained by long-distance coupling of the amide vibrations. Likewise, the modeling reproduced some spectral changes caused by protein deuteration even when the protein structure was conserved.},

abstract = {A new integral estimate for four-center two-electron integrals is introduced that accounts for distance information between the bra- and ket-charge distributions describing the two electrons. The screening is denoted as QQR and combines the most important features of the conventional Schwarz screening by Haser and Ahlrichs published in 1989 [J. Comput. Chem. 10, 104 (1989)] and our multipole-based integral estimates (MBIE) introduced in 2005 [D. S. Lambrecht and C. Ochsenfeld, J. Chem. Phys. 123, 184101 (2005)]. At the same time the estimates are not only tighter but also much easier to implement, so that we recommend them instead of our MBIE bounds introduced first for accounting for charge-distance information. The inclusion of distance dependence between charge distributions is not only useful at the SCF level but is particularly important for describing electron-correlation effects, e.g., within AO-MP2 theory, where the decay behavior is at least 1/R(4) or even 1/R(6). In our present work, we focus on studying the efficiency of our QQR estimates within SCF theory and demonstrate the performance for a benchmark set of 44 medium to large molecules, where savings of up to a factor of 2 for exchange integrals are observed for larger systems. Based on the results of the benchmark set we show that reliable tightness of integral estimates is more important for the screening performance than rigorous upper bound properties.},

abstract = {We study the effect of critical pairing fluctuations on the electronic properties in the normal state of a clean superconductor in three dimensions. Using a functional renormalization group approach to take the non-Gaussian nature of critical fluctuations into account, we show microscopically that in the BCS regime, where the inverse coherence length is much smaller than the Fermi wave vector, critical pairing fluctuations give rise to a nonanalytic contribution to the quasiparticle damping of order TcGiln(80/Gi), where the Ginzburg-Levanyuk number Gi is a dimensionless measure for the width of the critical region. As a consequence, there is a temperature window above Tc where the quasiparticle damping due to critical pairing fluctuations can be larger than the usual T2 Fermi liquid damping due to noncritical scattering processes. On the other hand, in the strong coupling regime where Gi is of order unity, we find within the Gaussian approximation that the quasiparticle damping due to critical pairing fluctuations is proportional to the temperature. Moreover, we show that in the vicinity of the critical temperature Tc the electronic density of states exhibits a fluctuation-induced pseudogap. We also use functional renormalization group methods to derive and classify various types of higher-order scattering processes induced by the pairing interaction in Fermi systems close to the superconducting instability.},

abstract = {When an algorithm in dimension one is extended to dimension d, in nearly every case its computational cost is taken to the power d. This fundamental difficulty is the single greatest impediment to solving many important problems and has been dubbed the curse of dimensionality. For numerical analysis in dimension d, we propose to use a representation for vectors and matrices that generalizes separation of variables while allowing controlled accuracy. Basic linear algebra operations can be performed in this representation using one-dimensional operations, thus bypassing the exponential scaling with respect to the dimension. Although not all operators and algorithms may be compatible with this representation, we believe that many of the most important ones are. We prove that the multiparticle Schr{\"{o}}dinger operator, as well as the inverse Laplacian, can be represented very efficiently in this form. We give numerical evidence to support the conjecture that eigenfunctions inherit this property by computing the groundstate eigenfunction for a simplified Schr{\"{o}}dinger operator with 30 particles. We conjecture and provide numerical evidence that functions of operators inherit this property, in which case numerical operator calculus in higher dimensions becomes feasible.},

abstract = {Several widely used methods for the calculation of band structures and photo emission spectra, such as the G W approximation, rely on manybody perturbation theory. They can be obtained by iterating a set of functional differential equations (DEs) relating the one-particle Green's function (GF) to its functional derivative with respect to an external perturbing potential. In this work, we apply a linear response expansion in order to obtain insights into various approximations for GF calculations. The expansion leads to an effective screening while keeping the effects of the interaction to all orders. In order to study various aspects of the resulting equations, we discretize them and retain only one point in space, spin and time for all variables. Within this one-point model we obtain an explicit solution for the GF, which allows us to explore the structure of the general family of solutions and to determine the specific solution that corresponds to the physical one. Moreover, we analyze the performances of established approaches like G W over the whole range of interaction strength, and we explore alternative approximations. Finally, we link certain approximations for the exact solution to the corresponding manipulations of the DE which produces them. This link is crucial in view of a generalization of our findings to the real (multidimensional functional) case where only the DE is known. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of ligand dissociation energies for computational chemistry, obtaining accurate ab initio reference data is difficult and density-functional methods of uncertain reliability are chosen for feasibility reasons. Here, we consider advanced coupled-cluster and multi-configurational approaches to reinvestigate our WCCR10 set of ten gas-phase ligand dissociation energies. We assess the potential multi-configurational character of all molecules involved in these reactions in order to determine where single-reference coupled-cluster approaches can be applied. For some reactions of the WCCR10 set, large deviations from density-functional results including semiclassical dispersion corrections from experimental reference data had been observed. We tackle the issue (i) by comparing to ab initio data that comprise dispersion effects on a rigorous first-principles footing and (ii) by a comparison of density-functional approaches that model dispersion interactions in various ways. Only for two reactions, species exhibiting nonnegligible static electron correlation were identified, and hence, we may choose standard single-reference coupled-cluster approaches to compare with density-functional methods for the other eight reactions. For WCCR10, the Minnesota M06-L functional yielded the smallest mean absolute deviation without additional dispersion corrections in comparison to the coupled-cluster results and the PBE0-D3 functional produced the overall smallest mean absolute deviation. The agreement of density-functional results with coupled-cluster data increases significantly upon inclusion of any type of dispersion correction. It is important to emphasize that different density-functional schemes available for this purpose perform equally well. The coupled-cluster dissociation energies, however, deviate significantly from experimental results.},

abstract = {Second-order perturbation theory based on the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian leads to an implicit density functional for the correlation energy Ec MP2, which is explicitly dependent on both occupied and unoccupied Kohn-Sham single-particle orbitals and energies. The corresponding correlation potential vc MP2, which has to be evaluated by the optimized potential method, was found to be divergent in the asymptotic region of atoms, if positive-energy continuum states are included in the calculation [Facco Bonetti, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 2241 (2001)]. On the other hand, Niquet, [J. Chem. Phys. 118, 9504 (2003)] showed that vc MP2 has the same asymptotic -$\alpha$ (2 r4) behavior as the exact correlation potential, if the system under study has a discrete spectrum only. In this work we study vc MP2 for atoms in a spherical cavity within a basis-set-free finite differences approach, ensuring a completely discrete spectrum by requiring hard-wall boundary conditions at the cavity radius. Choosing this radius sufficiently large, one can devise a numerical continuation procedure which allows to normalize vc MP2 consistent with the standard choice vc (r→∞) =0 for free atoms, without modifying the potential in the chemically relevant region. An important prerequisite for the success of this scheme is the inclusion of very high-energy virtual states. Using this technique, we have calculated vc MP2 for all closed-shell and spherical open-shell atoms up to argon. One finds that vc MP2 reproduces the shell structure of the exact correlation potential very well but consistently overestimates the corresponding shell oscillations. In the case of spin-polarized atoms one observes a strong interrelation between the correlation potentials of the two spin channels, which is completely absent for standard density functionals. However, our results also demonstrate that Ec MP2 can only serve as a first step towards the construction of a suitable implicit correlation functional: The fundamental variational instability of this functional is recovered for beryllium, for which a breakdown of the self-consistent Kohn-Sham iteration is observed. Moreover, even for those atoms for which the self-consistent iteration is stable, the results indicate that the inclusion of vc MP2 in the total Kohn-Sham potential does not lead to an improvement compared to the complete neglect of the correlation potential. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Using this approximation in the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem leads to a new family of Kohn-Sham methods. The new methods yield reaction energies and barriers of unprecedented accuracy and enable a treatment of static (strong) correlation with an accuracy of high-level multireference configuration interaction methods but are single-reference methods allowing for a black-box-like handling of static correlation. The new methods exhibit a better scaling of the computational effort with the system size than rivaling wave-function-based electronic structure methods. Moreover, the new methods do not suffer from the problem of singularities in response functions plaguing previous ACFD methods and therefore are applicable to any type of electronic system.},

abstract = {A simple modification of second-order M{\o}ller–Plesset perturbation theory ͑MP2͒ to improve the description of molecular ground state energies is proposed. The total MP2 correlation energy is partitioned into parallel-and antiparallel-spin components which are separately scaled. The two parameters ͑scaling factors͒, whose values can be justified by basic theoretical arguments, have been optimized on a benchmark set of 51 reaction energies composed of 74 first-row molecules. It is found, that the new method performs significantly better than standard MP2: the rms ͓mean absolute error ͑MAE͔͒ deviation drops from 4.6 ͑3.3͒ to 2.3 ͑1.8͒ kcal/mol. The maximum error is reduced from 13.3 to 5.1 kcal/mol. Significant improvements are especially observed for cases which are usually known as MP2 pitfalls while cases already described well with MP2 remain almost unchanged. Even for 11 atomization energies not considered in the fit, uniform improvements ͓MAE: 8.1 kcal/mol ͑MP2͒ versus 3.2 kcal/mol ͑new͔͒ are found. The results are furthermore compared with those from density functional theory ͑DFT/B3LYP͒ and quadratic configuration interaction ͓QCISD/QCISD͑T͔͒ calculations. Also for difficult systems including strong ͑nondynamical͒ correlation effects, the improved MP2 method clearly outperforms DFT/B3LYP and yields results of QCISD or sometimes QCISD͑T͒ quality. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for ten diatomic molecules also show consistent enhancements. The uniformity with which the new method improves upon MP2, thereby rectifying many of its problems, indicates significant robustness and suggests it as a valuable quantum chemical method of general use.},

abstract = {We summarize the MOLGW code that implements density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory in a Gaussian basis set. The code is dedicated to the calculation of the many-body self-energy within the GW approximation and the solution of the Bethe–Salpeter equation. These two types of calculations allow the user to evaluate physical quantities that can be compared to spectroscopic experiments. Quasiparticle energies, obtained through the calculation of the GW self-energy, can be compared to photoemission or transport experiments, and neutral excitation energies and oscillator strengths, obtained via solution of the Bethe–Salpeter equation, are measurable by optical absorption. The implementation choices outlined here have aimed at the accuracy and robustness of calculated quantities with respect to measurements. Furthermore, the algorithms implemented in MOLGW allow users to consider molecules or clusters containing up to 100 atoms with rather accurate basis sets, and to choose whether or not to apply the resolution-of-the-identity approximation. Finally, we demonstrate the parallelization efficacy of the MOLGW code over several hundreds of processors.

@article{Brosens1980,
abstract = {By making the dynamical-exchange decoupling in the equation of motion for the Wigner distribution function, exchange effects in the dielectric function of the homogeneous electron gas were, in an earlier derivation, described by a frequency-dependent local-field correction G(q,). In paper I, details were provided how the sixfold integral for G(q,) can be reduced analytically into a double integral, adapted for numerical purposes. In this paper, the consequences of dynamical-exchange effects are studied, and the theory is tested for its internal consistency. The evaluation of the pair correlation function g(r) at the origin from both the static limit and the high-frequency limit of the frequency-dependent local-field correction G(q,) leads to the same value g(0)=12, in contrast to other theories where, from both limits, different results are obtained. Also, the compressibility, calculated from the dielectric function including exchange, agrees with the Hartree-Fock result. Furthermore, it is shown that the high-frequency limit of G(q,) satisfies the general properties implied by the third-frequency-moment sum rule, resulting again in g(0)=12 and leading to the Hartree-Fock ground-state energy. This consistency between the static and high-frequency behavior of G(q,) cannot be fulfilled by any static approximation to G(q,), because an adequate treatment of dynamical-exchange effects involves excited states that are consistent with the Hartree-Fock ground state. In the static limit, G(q,) exhibits a relatively sharp peak near q=2kF. This peak induces an instability of the homogeneous electron gas, quite similar to and in the same density range as the instability of the spin susceptibility discussed by Hamann and Overhauser. For rs10.6, a supplementary instability relative to charge-density deformations occurs. The frequency dependence of G(q,) is examined, and numerical values for ReG(q,) and ImG(q,) are presented. The real part of the dielectric function and the imaginary part of the inverse dielectric function are plotted for several densities in the metallic range. Compared to the random-phase approximation (RPA), the frequencies of the maxima in the structure factor obtained in the present work (i.e., with dynamical-exchange decoupling) are shifted to lower frequencies. The plasmon dispersion is considerably closer to recent experimental data in aluminium than with RPA. Finally, it turns out that the inclusion of frequency-dependent exchange effects results in the natural occurrence of spin- and charge-density waves. These are the dynamical extension of the instability relative to magnetic perturbations, found in the static limit at low densities. {\textcopyright} 1980 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The difficulty of approximate density functionals in describing the energetics of Diels-Alder reactions and dimerization of aluminum complexes is analyzed. Both of these reaction classes involve formation of cyclic or bicyclic products, which are found to be underbound by the majority of functionals considered. We present a consistent view of these results from the perspective of delocalization error. This error causes approximate functionals to give too low energy for delocalized densities or too high energy for localized densities, as in the cyclic and bicyclic reaction products. This interpretation allows us to understand better a wide range of errors in main-group thermochemistry obtained with popular density functionals. In general, functionals with minimal delocalization error should be used for theoretical studies of reactions where there is a loss of extended conjugation or formation of highly branched, cyclic, and cagelike molecules. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The rates for up-conversion intersystem crossing (UISC) from the T1 state to the S1 state are calculated for a series of organic emitters with an emphasis on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Both the spin-orbit coupling and the energy difference between the S1 and T1 states ($\Delta$EST) are evaluated, at the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT levels. The calculated UISC rates and $\Delta$EST values are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data. Our results underline that small $\Delta$EST values and sizable spin-orbit coupling matrix elements have to be simultaneously realized in order to facilitate UISC and ultimately TADF. Importantly, the spatial separation of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the emitter, a widely accepted strategy for the design of TADF molecules, does not necessarily lead to a sufficient reduction in $\Delta$EST; in fact, either a significant charge-transfer (CT) contribution to the T1 state or a minimal energy difference between the local-excitation and charge-transfer triplet states is required to achieve a small $\Delta$EST. Also, having S1 and T1 states of a different nature is found to strongly enhance spin-orbit coupling, which is consistent with the El-Sayed rule for ISC rates. Overall, our results indicate that having either similar energies for the local-excitation and charge-transfer triplet states or the right balance between a substantial CT contribution to T1 and somewhat different natures of the S1 and T1 states, paves the way toward UISC enhancement and thus TADF efficiency improvement.},

The space time approach to this approximation scales, in principle, as O(N3), but for crystals it is nearly impossible to exploit this feature because it requires too much computer memory. Here we remove this memory bottleneck by restricting the screened Coulomb interaction in the GW self-energy to its Nyquist content. This reduces both the needed memory and the CPU time by several orders of magnitude, while keeping satisfactory agreement with experimentally measured gaps. Our method allows exploiting the O(N3) scaling feature of the GW space time approach with modest computational resources and it will facilitate the computation of the fundamental gaps of organic semiconductors.},

There are, however, well-known limitations to this approach. In particular, MP2 is known to fail or diverge for some prototypical condensed matter systems like the homogeneous electron gas (HEG) and to overestimate dispersion-driven interactions in strongly polarizable systems. In this paper, we explore how the issues of MP2 for metallic, polarizable, and strongly correlated periodic systems can be ameliorated through regularization. To this end, two regularized second-order methods (including a new, size-extensive Brillouin-Wigner approach) are applied to the HEG, the one-dimensional Hubbard model, and the graphene-water interaction. We find that regularization consistently leads to improvements over the MP2 baseline and that different regularizers are appropriate for the various systems.},

Dispersion corrections tend to be detrimental, in spite of the fact that XB is considered a noncovalent interaction. Wave function techniques require heavy correlated methods (i.e., CCSD(T)) or parametrized ones (SCS-MP2 or SCS(MI)MP2). Heavy basis sets are needed to obtain high accuracy, such as aVQZ or aVTZ+CP, and ideally a CBS extrapolation. Relativistic ECPs are also important, even for the bromine based dimers. In addition, we explored some XB with new theoretical tools, the NCI ("Non-Covalent Interactions") method and the NOFF ("Natural Orbital Fukui Functions"). {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

We briefly sketch the derivation of the underlying equations, give details about the implementation, and apply the method to several atomic and diatomic systems. The influence of spin-orbit coupling changes calculated first ionization energies by up to 0.7 eV, leading to maximum errors smaller than 0.3 eV. Virtually the same results are obtained with an economic extrapolation scheme based on the one-component G0W0 and the two-component reference state calculation.

Its other special features, the highly competitive linear-scaling local correlation schemes, allow for MP2, RPA, ADC(2), CCSD(T), and higher-order CC calculations for extended systems. Local correlation calculations can be considerably accelerated by multi-level approximations and DFT-embedding techniques, and an interface to molecular dynamics software is provided for quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations.

@article{Chen2018,
abstract = {It has been suspected since the early days of the random-phase approximation (RPA) that corrections to RPA correlation energies result mostly from short-range correlation effects and are thus amenable to perturbation theory. Here we test this hypothesis by analyzing formal and numerical results for the most common beyond-RPA perturbative corrections, including the bare second-order exchange (SOX), second-order screened exchange (SOSEX), and approximate exchange kernel (AXK) methods. Our analysis is facilitated by efficient and robust algorithms based on the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation and numerical frequency integration, which enable benchmark beyond-RPA calculations on medium- and large-size molecules with size-independent accuracy. The AXK method systematically improves upon RPA, SOX, and SOSEX for reaction barrier heights, reaction energies, and noncovalent interaction energies of main-group compounds. The improved accuracy of AXK compared with SOX and SOSEX is attributed to stronger screening of bare SOX in AXK. For reactions involving transition-metal compounds, particularly 3d transition-metal dimers, the AXK correction is too small and can even have the wrong sign. These observations are rationalized by a measure $\alpha$ of the effective coupling strength for beyond-RPA correlation. When the effective coupling strength increases beyond a critical $\alpha$ value of approximately 0.5, the RPA errors increase rapidly and perturbative corrections become unreliable. Thus, perturbation theory can systematically correct RPA but only for systems and properties qualitatively well captured by RPA, as indicated by small $\alpha$ values.},

Though this approximation can be considered as a fantastic tradeoff between accuracy and simplicity, there exist ionization potentials of simple molecules that are unacceptably wrong. We derive here a working approximation to the density matrix that we name the GW density matrix. This relatively light approximation improves several physical properties and, in particular, it yields excellent electronic dipoles for the examined molecules. As a direct consequence, the ionization potentials are affected through the change in the electrostatic potential and in the exchange operator. Benchmarking on a set of 34 molecules, we demonstrate that most of the error in the GW ionization potentials is indeed eliminated thanks to this simple addition. This contribution is not a vertex correction, but nevertheless it is crucial when going beyond the standard GW.},

Through comparison of CCSD(TQ) and CCSD(T) binding energies the first direct assessment of the effects of quadruple excitations on $\pi$⋯$\pi$ interactions is presented. The influence of triple excitations is assessed not only in the conventional manner that permeates the literature (comparison of CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies) but also via comparison of CCSD(T) and CCSD data. In systems exhibiting significant electron delocalization, it is well-known that triples contributions to binding energy are quite large (on the order of l kcal mol )-1. In these cases, quadruple excitations are nonnegligible and tend to be an order of magnitude smaller than the correction to the binding energy from triple excitations (on the order of 0.1 kcal mol -1). The largest quadruples correction observed was +0.2 kcal mol -1 for the furan dimer.},

abstract = {Ionization potentials (IPs) and electron affinities (EAs) are important quantities input into most models for calculating the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of organic solar cells. We assess the semi-empirical density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) method with the third-order self-consistent charge (SCC) correction and the 3ob parameter set (the third-order DFTB (DFTB3) organic and biochemistry parameter set) against experiments (for smaller molecules) and against first-principles GW (Green's function, G, times the screened potential, W) calculations (for larger molecules of interest in organic electronics) for the calculation of IPs and EAs. Since GW calculations are relatively new for molecules of this size, we have also taken care to validate these calculations against experiments. As expected, DFTB is found to behave very much like density-functional theory (DFT), but with some loss of accuracy in predicting IPs and EAs. For small molecules, the best results were found with $\Delta$SCF ($\Delta$ self-consistent field) SCC-DFTB calculations for first IPs (good to ± 0.649 eV). When considering several IPs of the same molecule, it is convenient to use the negative of the orbital energies (which we refer to as Koopmans' theorem (KT) IPs) as an indication of trends. Linear regression analysis shows that KT SCC-DFTB IPs are nearly as accurate as $\Delta$SCF SCC-DFTB eigenvalues (± 0.852 eV for first IPs, but ± 0.706 eV for all of the IPs considered here) for small molecules. For larger molecules, SCC-DFTB was also the ideal choice with IP/EA errors of ± 0.489/0.740 eV from $\Delta$SCF calculations and of ± 0.326/0.458 eV from (KT) orbital energies. Interestingly, the linear least squares fit for the KT IPs of the larger molecules also proves to have good predictive value for the lower energy KT IPs of smaller molecules, with significant deviations appearing only for IPs of 15-20 eV or larger. We believe that this quantitative analysis of errors in SCC-DFTB IPs and EAs may be of interest to other researchers interested in DFTB investigation of large and complex problems, such as those encountered in organic electronics.},

Rolik et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 094105 (2013)]. The new algorithm is an order of magnitude faster than our previous one and removes the bottleneck related to the calculation of the (T) contribution. First, a numerical Laplace transformed expression for the (T) fragment energy is introduced, which requires on average 3 to 4 times fewer floating point operations with negligible compromise in accuracy eliminating the redundancy among the evaluated triples amplitudes. Second, an additional speedup factor of 3 is achieved by the optimization of our canonical (T) algorithm, which is also executed in the local case. These developments can also be integrated into canonical as well as alternative fragmentation-based local CCSD(T) approaches with minor modifications. As it is demonstrated by our benchmark cal...},

abstract = {Results for the lattice constants, atomization energies, and band gaps of typical semiconductors and insulators are presented for Hartree-Fock and second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). We find that MP2 tends to undercorrelate weakly polarizable systems and overcorrelates strongly polarizable systems. As a result, lattice constants are overestimated for large gap systems and underestimated for small gap systems. The volume dependence of the MP2 correlation energy and the dependence of the MP2 band gaps on the static dielectric screening properties are discussed in detail. Moreover, the relationship between MP2 and the G0 W0 quasiparticle energies is elucidated and discussed. Finally, we demonstrate explicitly that the correlation energy diverges with decreasing k -point spacing for metals. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Pair atomic density fitting (PADF) is a promising strategy to reduce the scaling with system size of quantum chemical methods for the calculation of the correlation energy like the direct random phase approximation (RPA) or second-order M{\{}$\backslash$o{\}}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). PADF can however introduce large errors in correlation energies as the two-electron interaction energy is not guaranteed to be bounded from below. This issue can be partially alleviated by using very large fit sets, but this comes at the price of reduced efficiency and having to deal with near-linear dependencies in the fit set. In this work, we introduce an alternative methodology to overcome this problem that preserves the intrinsically favourable scaling of PADF. We first regularize the Fock matrix by projecting out parts of the basis set which gives rise to orbital products that are hard to describe by PADF. We then also apply this projector to the orbital coefficient matrix to improve the precision of PADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA. We systematically assess the accuracy of this new approach in a numerical atomic orbital framework using Slater Type Orbitals (STO) and correlation consistent Gaussian type basis sets up to quintuple-{\$}\backslashzeta{\$} quality for systems with more than 200 atoms. For the small and medium systems in the S66 database we show the maximum deviation of PADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA relative correlation energies to DF-MP2 and DF-RPA reference results to be 0.07 and 0.14 kcal/mol respectively. When the new projector method is used, the errors only slightly increase for large molecules and also when moderately sized fit sets are used the resulting errors are well under control. Finally, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of our algorithm by calculating the interaction energies of non-covalently bound complexes with more than 1000 atoms and 20000 atomic orbitals at the RPA@PBE/CC-pVTZ level of theory.},

abstract = {Exciton coupling between two or more chlorophyll (Chl) pigments is a key mechanism associated with the color tuning of photosynthetic proteins but it is difficult to disentangle this effect from shifts that are due to the protein microenvironment. Herein, we report the formation of the simplest coupled system, the Chl a dimer, tagged with a quaternary ammonium ion by electrospray ionization. Based on action spectroscopic studies in vacuo, the dimer complexes were found to absorb 50-70 meV to the red of the monomers under the same conditions. First-principles calculations predict shifts that somewhat depend on the relative orientation of the two Chl units, namely 50 and 30 meV for structures where the Chl rings are stacked and unstacked, respectively. Our work demonstrates that Chl association alone can produce a large portion of the color shift observed in photosynthetic macromolecular assemblies. How strong is the coupling between two adjacent chlorophyll molecules in the absence of a protein environment? Mass spectrometry experiments now provide an answer to this question as chlorophyll a dimers tagged by quaternary ammonium ions could be produced in the gas phase by electrospray ionization.},

abstract = {The major source of errror in most ab initio calculations of molecular energies is the truncation of the one-electron basis set. A complete basis set model chemistry is defined to include corrections for basis set truncation errors. This model uses double zeta plus polarization level atomic pair natural orbital basis sets to calculate molecular self-consistent-field (SCF) energies and correlation energies. The small corrections to give the complete basis set SCF energies are then estimated using the l-6 asymptotic convergence of the multicenter angular momentum expansion. The calculated correlation energies of the atoms He, Be, and Ne, and of the hydrides LiH, BH3, CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF, using the double zeta plus polarization basis sets vary from 83.0{\%} to 91.2{\%} of the experimental correlation energies. However, extrapolation of each of the pair energies and pair-coupling terms to the complete basis set values using the asymptotic convergence of pair natural orbital expansions retrieves from 99.5 ± 0.7{\%} to 101.1 ± 0.6{\%} of the experimental correlation energies for these atoms and molecules. With the exception of ammonia which gave 101.1{\%}, the calculated correlation energies agree with the experimental values to within the error limits of the experiments for all these atoms and molecules with more than four electrons. The total extrapolated energies (ESCF + E Correlation) are then in agreement with experiment to within ± 0.0014 hartree (root mean square deviation) and represent the most accurate total energy calculations yet reported for the molecules. The largest discrepancies with experiment occur for methane, where we obtain E Total = - 40.5112 hartree compared to EExpt = - 40.514 ± 0.002 hartree, and ammonia, where we obtain ETotal = - 56.5659 hartree compared to EExpt = - 56.563 ± 0.002 hartree. {\textcopyright} 1988 American Institute of Physics.},

The present work adds to this body of knowledge by examining outcomes from seven introductory programming instructors: three novices to PI and four with a range of PI experience. Through common measurements of student perceptions, we provide evidence that introductory computing instructors can successfully implement PI in their classrooms. We find encouraging minimum (74{\%}) and average (92{\%}) levels of success as measured through student valuation of PI for their learning. This work also documents and hypothesizes reasons for comparatively poor survey results in one course, highlighting the importance of the choice of grading policy (participation vs. correctness) for new PI adopters.},

The same algorithm can appear dramatically different when written in the two different vocabularies. In this work, we carefully describe the translation between the two languages in several contexts. First, we describe how to efficiently implement the ab initio DMRG sweep using a matrix product operator based code, and the equivalence to the original renormalized operator implementation. Next we describe how to implement the general matrix product operator/matrix product state algebra within a pure renormalized operator-based DMRG code. Finally, we discuss two improvements of the ab initio DMRG sweep algorithm motivated by matrix product operator language: Hamiltonian compression, and a sum over operators representation that allows for perfect computational parallelism. The connections and correspondences described here serve to link the future developments with the past and are important in the efficient implementation of continuing advances in ab initio DMRG and related algorithms.},

abstract = {Luttinger's theorem is a major result in many-body physics that states the volume of the Fermi surface is directly proportional to the particle density. In its 'hard' form, Luttinger's theorem implies that the Fermi volume is invariant with respect to interactions (as opposed to a 'soft' Luttinger's theorem, where this invariance is lost). Despite it is simplicity, the conditions on the fermionic self energy under which Luttinger's theorem is valid remains a matter of debate, with possible requirements for its validity ranging from particle-hole symmetry to analyticity about the Fermi surface. In this paper, we propose the minimal requirements for the application of a hard Luttinger's theorem to a generic fermionic system of arbitrary interaction strength by invoking the Atiyah-Singer index theorem to quantify the topologically-robust behavior of a generalized Fermi surface. We show that the applicability of a hard Luttinger's theorem in a D-dimensional system is directly dependent on the existence of a (D - 1)-dimensional manifold of gapless chiral excitations at the Fermi level, regardless of whether the system exhibits Luttinger or Fermi surfaces (i.e., manifolds of zeroes of the Green's function and inverse Green's function, respectively). The exact form of the self-energy which guarantees validity of a hard Luttinger's theorem is derived, and agreement with current experiments, numerics, and theories are discussed.},

The estimates are based on our recently introduced QQR approach [S. A. Maurer, D. S. Lambrecht, D. Flaig, and C. Ochsenfeld, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 144107 (2012)], which exploits the asympotic decay of the integral values with increasing bra-ket separation as deduced from the multipole expansion and combines this decay behavior with the common Schwarz bound to a tight and simple estimate. We demonstrate on a diverse selection of benchmark systems that our AO-MP2 method in combination with the QQR-type estimates produces reliable results for systems with both localized and delocalized electronic structure, while in the latter case the screening essentially reverts to the common Schwarz screening. For systems with localized electronic structure, our AO-MP2 method shows an early onset of linear scaling as demonstrated on DNA systems. The favorable scaling behavior allows to compute systems with more than 1000 atoms and 10,000 basis functions on a single core that are clearly not accessible with conventional MP2 methods. Furthermore, our AO-MP2 method is particularly suited for parallelization and we present benchmark calculations on a protein-DNA repair complex comprising 2025 atoms and 20,371 basis functions.},

Then, as exemplified by the trans-azobenzene molecule and the carbon nanotubes, the Tamm-Dancoff approximation yields errors larger than the accuracy claimed in ab initio calculations. Instead, we propose a general and efficient approach that avoids the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, correctly describes excitons, plasmons, and exciton-plasmon states, and provides a good agreement with experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The linear scaling local correlation approach, termed "cluster-in-molecule" (CIM), is extended to the coupled-cluster (CC) theory with singles and doubles (CCSD) and CC methods with singles, doubles, and noniterative triples, including CCSD(T) and the completely renormalized CR-CC(2,3) approach. The resulting CIM-CCSD, CIM-CCSD(T), and CIM-CR-CC(2,3) methods are characterized by (i) the linear scaling of the CPU time with the system size, (ii) the use of orthonormal orbitals in the CC subsystem calculations, (iii) the natural parallelism, (iv) the high computational efficiency, enabling calculations for much larger systems and at higher levels of CC theory than previously possible, and (v) the purely noniterative character of local triples corrections. By comparing the results of the canonical and CIM-CC calculations for normal alkanes and water clusters, it is shown that the CIM-CCSD, CIM-CCSD(T), and CIM-CR-CC(2,3) approaches accurately reproduce the corresponding canonical CC correlation and relative energies, while offering savings in the computer effort by orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {In this work, we give a comprehensive derivation of an exact and numerically feasible method to perform ab initio calculations of quantum particles interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We present a hierarchy of density-functional-type theories that describe the interaction of charged particles with photons and introduce the appropriate Kohn-Sham schemes. We show how the evolution of a system described by quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb gauge is uniquely determined by its initial state and two reduced quantities. These two fundamental observables, the polarization of the Dirac field and the vector potential of the photon field, can be calculated by solving two coupled, nonlinear evolution equations without the need to explicitly determine the (numerically infeasible) many-body wave function of the coupled quantum system. To find reliable approximations to the implicit functionals, we present the appropriate Kohn-Sham construction. In the nonrelativistic limit, this density-functional-type theory of quantum electrodynamics reduces to the density-functional reformulation of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, which is based on the current density of the electrons and the vector potential of the photon field. By making further approximations, e.g., restricting the allowed modes of the photon field, we derive further density-functional-type theories of coupled matter-photon systems for the corresponding approximate Hamiltonians. In the limit of only two sites and one mode we deduce the appropriate effective theory for the two-site Hubbard model coupled to one photonic mode. This model system is used to illustrate the basic ideas of a density-functional reformulation in great detail and we present the exact Kohn-Sham potentials for our coupled matter-photon model system. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We investigated the potential-energy surface (PES) of the phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine tripeptide in the gas phase by means of IR/UV double-resonance spectroscopy, and quantum chemical and statistical thermodynamic calculations. Experimentally, we observed four conformational structures and we recorded their IR spectra in the spectral region of 3000-4000 cm-1. Computationally, we investigated the PES by a combination of molecular dynamics/quenching procedures with high-level correlated ab initio calculations. We found that neither empirical potentials nor various DFT functionals provide satisfactory results. On the other hand, the approximative DFT method covering the dispersion energy yields a reliable set of the most stable structures, which we subsequently investigated with an accurate, correlated ab initio treatment. The global minimum contains three moderately strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds and is mainly stabilized by London dispersion forces between the phenyl ring, the carboxylic acid group, and various peptide bonds. A proper description of the last type of interaction requires accurate correlated ab initio calculations, including the complete basis set limit of the MP2 method and CCSD(T) correction terms. Since in our beam experiments the conformations are frozen by cooling from a higher temperature, it is necessary to localize the most stable structures on the free-energy surface rather than on the PES. We used two different procedures (rigid rotor/harmonic oscillator/ideal gas approximation based on ab initio characteristics and evaluation of relative populations from the molecular dynamic simulations using the AMBER potential) and both yield four structures, the global minimum and three local minima. These four structures were among the 15 most energetically stable structures obtained from accurate ab initio optimization. The calculated IR spectra for these four structures agree well with the experimental frequencies, which validates the localization procedure. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

The method is exact, requires neither auxiliary basis sets nor projections, and can be applied to Gaussian and Slater basis sets. Two improvements in the partition-expansion method for Slater functions are reported: general expressions valid for arbitrary quantum numbers are derived and the efficiency of the procedure is increased giving analytical solutions to integrals previously computed by numerical quadrature.

We explain this decrease by an enhancement of the dielectric screening of the long-range Coulomb interaction between the effective charges with a growing number of layers.

This allows us to identify promising candidates which can then be used to improve the cell's efficiency. First, we investigate the accuracy of different theoretical approaches by benchmarking them against experimentally determined GSOPs. We test different methods to calculate the vertical oxidation potential, includingGWwith different levels of self-consistency, Kohn-Sham (KS) orbital energies and total energy differences. We find that there is little difference in the performance of these methods. However, we show that it is crucial to take into account solvent effects as well as the structural relaxation of the dye after oxidation. Other thermodynamic contributions are negligible. Based on this benchmark, we decide on an optimal strategy, balancing computational cost and accuracy, to screen more than 1000 dyes and identify promising candidates which could be used to construct more robust DS-PECs.},

These parameters are obtained from quantum- chemistry calculations on the monomers, and used without further adaptation directly for intermolecular interactions. The approach works very well as shown here for four dimers, where high-level coupled cluster with singles and doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) and density functional theory (DFT) Swart-Sola `-Bickelhaupt functional including Grimme's dispersion correction (SSB-D) reference data are available for comparison. The energy surfaces for the three methods are very similar, which is also the case for the interaction between a water molecule with either a chloride anion or a sodium cation. These latter systems had previously been used to criticize Thole's damped point-dipole method, but here we show that with the correct use of the method, it is perfectly able to describe the intermolecular interactions. This is most obvious for the induced dipole moment as function of the chloride–oxygen distance, where the direct (discrete) reaction field results are virtually indistinguishable from those obtained at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ.},

Based mainly on the results of our study, this paper summarizes the mechanisms of UVA-induced DNA damage in the presence of various photosensitizers, and also proposes a new mechanism for its chemoprevention. UVA radiation induces DNA damage at the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3' sequence in double-stranded DNA through Type I mechanism, which involves electron transfer from guanine to activated photosensitizers. Endogenous sensitizers such as riboflavin and pterin derivatives and an exogenous sensitizer nalidixic acid mediate DNA photodamage via this mechanism. The major Type II mechanism involves the generation of singlet oxygen from photoactivated sensitizers, including hematoporphyrin and a fluoroquinolone antibacterial lomefloxacin, resulting in damage to guanines without preference for consecutive guanines. UVA also produces superoxide anion radical by an electron transfer from photoexcited sensitizers to oxygen (minor Type II mechanism), and DNA damage is induced by reactive species generated through the interaction of hydrogen peroxide with metal ions. The involvement of these mechanisms in UVA carcinogenesis is discussed. In addition, we found that xanthone derivatives inhibited DNA damage caused by photoexcited riboflavin via the quenching of its excited triplet state. It is thus considered that naturally occurring quenchers including xanthone derivatives may act as novel chemopreventive agents against photocarcinogenesis.},

This is done by replacing the uncoupled second order dispersion contribution contained in the supermolecular MP2 energy with the coupled dispersion energy obtained from the TDDFT approach. Preliminary results for the rare gas dimers He2, Ne2, and Ar2 and a few structures of the (HF)2 and (H2O)2 dimers show that the conventional MP2 interaction energies are considerably improved by this procedure if compared to coupled cluster singles doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] interaction energies. However, the quality of the interaction energies obtained in this way strongly depends on the exchange-correlation potential employed in the monomer calculations: It is shown that an exact exchange-only potential surprisingly often performs better than an asymptotically corrected hybrid exchange-correlation potential. Therefore the method proposed in this work is similar to the method by Cybulski and Lytle [J. Chem. Phys., 127, 141102 (2007)] which corrects the supermolecular MP2 energies with a scaled dispersion energy from time-dependent Hartree-Fock.

In this work, we consider systems conventionally considered to be dominated by SIE. For these systems, we demonstrate that by using multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT), the error of a translated local density-functional approximation is significantly reduced (by a factor of 3) when using an MCSCF density and on-top density, as compared to using KS-DFT with the parent functional; the error in MC-PDFT with local on-top functionals is even lower than the error in some popular KS-DFT hybrid functionals. Density-functional theory, either in MC-PDFT form with local on-top functionals or in KS-DFT form with some functionals having 50{\%} or more nonlocal exchange, has smaller errors for SIE-prone systems than does CASSCF, which has no SIE.},

abstract = {The GW method is a many-body electronic structure technique capable of generating accurate quasiparticle properties for realistic systems spanning physics, chemistry, and materials science. Despite its power, GW is not routinely applied to study large complex assemblies due to the method's high computational overhead and quartic scaling with particle number. Here, the GW equations are recast, exactly, as Fourier-Laplace time integrals over complex time propagators. The propagators are then "shredded" via energy partitioning and the time integrals approximated in a controlled manner using generalized Gaussian quadrature(s) while discrete variable methods are employed to represent the required propagators in real space. The resulting cubic scaling GW method has a sufficiently small prefactor to outperform standard quartic scaling methods on small systems (≳10 atoms) and offers 2-3 order of magnitude improvement in large systems (≈200-300 atoms). It also represents a substantial improvement over other cubic methods tested for all system sizes studied. The approach can be applied to any theoretical framework containing large sums of terms with energy differences in the denominator.},

abstract = {A semi-empirical counterpoise-type correction for basis set superposition error (BSSE) in molecular systems is presented. An atom pair-wise potential corrects for the inter- and intra-molecular BSSE in supermolecular Hartree-Fock (HF) or density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This geometrical counterpoise (gCP) denoted scheme depends only on the molecular geometry, i.e., no input from the electronic wave-function is required and hence is applicable to molecules with ten thousands of atoms. The four necessary parameters have been determined by a fit to standard Boys and Bernadi counterpoise corrections for Hobzas S668 set of non-covalently bound complexes (528 data points). The methods target are small basis sets (e.g., minimal, split-valence, 6-31G), but reliable results are also obtained for larger triple- sets. The intermolecular BSSE is calculated by gCP within a typical error of 10-30 that proves sufficient in many practical applications. The approach is suggested as a quantitative correction in production work and can also be routinely applied to estimate the magnitude of the BSSE beforehand. The applicability for biomolecules as the primary target is tested for the crambin protein, where gCP removes intramolecular BSSE effectively and yields conformational energies comparable to def2-TZVP basis results. Good mutual agreement is also found with Jensens ACP(4) scheme, estimating the intramolecular BSSE in the phenylalanine-glycine- phenylalanine tripeptide, for which also a relaxed rotational energy profile is presented. A variety of minimal and double- basis sets combined with gCP and the dispersion corrections DFT-D3 and DFT-NL are successfully benchmarked on the S22 and S66 sets of non-covalent interactions. Outstanding performance with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.51 kcal/mol (0.38 kcal/mol after D3-refit) is obtained at the gCP-corrected HF-D3/(minimal basis) level for the S66 benchmark. The gCP-corrected B3LYP-D3/6-31G* model chemistry yields MAD0.68 kcal/mol, which represents a huge improvement over plain B3LYP/6-31G* (MAD2.3 kcal/mol). Application of gCP-corrected B97-D3 and HF-D3 on a set of large protein-ligand complexes prove the robustness of the method. Analytical gCP gradients make optimizations of large systems feasible with small basis sets, as demonstrated for the inter-ring distances of 9-helicene and most of the complexes in Hobzas S22 test set. The method is implemented in a freely available FORTRAN program obtainable from the authors website. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

Vanadium is differently coordinated by oxygen in the different systems. The calculated vibrational frequencies of bulk V2O5 are in good agreement with observed IR and Raman frequencies, for stretching modes the rms deviation is 40 cm-1. The calculations for the V2O5(001) surface suggest modifications of previous assignments of high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS) data. In agreement with HREELS, vanadyl frequencies shift to higher wave numbers on surface formation. The calculated frequencies for bulk Al2O3 are systematically lower than the observed IR data (by about 30 cm-1). Models for V2O3 supported on Al2O3 are obtained when in the outermost layers of Al2O3(0001) slabs Al is replaced by V. These films do not show vibrations above 930 cm-1. Oxygen adsorption on top of the vanadium sites on these supported films creates very stable vanadyl groups with binding energies of about 450 kJ/mol (1/2O2). Bond distances, vibrational frequencies, and oxygen binding energies are compared with those of vanadyl groups at the V2O5(001) surface and in (V2O5)n clusters (n = 2,4). The relevance of the findings for experiments on vanadia particles supported on alumina is discussed.},

abstract = {In the past decade, the random phase approximation (RPA) has emerged as a promising post-Kohn-Sham method to treat electron correlation in molecules, surfaces, and solids. In this review, we explain how RPA arises naturally as a zero-order approximation from the adiabatic connection and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in a density functional context. This is contrasted to RPA with exchange (RPAX) in a post-Hartree-Fock context. In both methods, RPA and RPAX, the correlation energy may be expressed as a sum over zero-point energies of harmonic oscillators representing collective electronic excitations, consistent with the physical picture originally proposed by Bohm and Pines. The extra factor 1/2 in the RPAX case is rigorously derived. Approaches beyond RPA are briefly summarized. We also review computational strategies implementing RPA. The combination of auxiliary expansions and imaginary frequency integration methods has lead to recent progress in this field, making RPA calculations affordable for systems with over 100 atoms. Finally, we summarize benchmark applications of RPA to various molecular and solid-state properties, including relative energies of conformers, reaction energies involving weak and covalent interactions, diatomic potential energy curves, ionization potentials and electron affinities, surface adsorption energies, bulk cohesive energies and lattice constants. RPA barrier heights for an extended benchmark set are presented. RPA is an order of magnitude more accurate than semi-local functionals such as B3LYP for non-covalent interactions rivaling the best empirically parametrized methods. Larger but systematic errors are observed for processes that do not conserve the number of electron pairs, such as atomization and ionization.},

abstract = {The leading cause of error in standard coupled cluster theory calculations of thermodynamic properties such as atomization energies and heats of formation originates with the truncation of the one-particle basis set expansion. Unfortunately, the use of finite basis sets is currently a computational necessity. Even with basis sets of quadruple zeta quality, errors can easily exceed 8 kcalmol in small molecules, rendering the results of little practical use. Attempts to address this serious problem have led to a wide variety of proposals for simple complete basis set extrapolation formulas that exploit the regularity in the correlation consistent sequence of basis sets. This study explores the effectiveness of six formulas for reproducing the complete basis set limit. The W4 approach was also examined, although in lesser detail. Reference atomization energies were obtained from standard coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) calculations involving basis sets of 6 or better quality for a collection of 141 molecules. In addition, a subset of 51 atomization energies was treated with explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12b calculations and very large basis sets. Of the formulas considered, all proved reliable at reducing the one-particle expansion error. Even the least effective formulas cut the error in the raw values by more than half, a feat requiring a much larger basis set without the aid of extrapolation. The most effective formulas cut the mean absolute deviation by a further factor of two. Careful examination of the complete body of statistics failed to reveal a single choice that out performed the others for all basis set combinations and all classes of molecules. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A new double-hybrid density functional, termed B2-PPW91, is presented which includes the Becke88 (B88) exchange in conjunction with Perdew-Wang91 (PW91) gradient-corrected correlation functional. The fitting parameters are obtained by minimization of mean absolute error of the static dipole polarizability of 4d transition metal monohalides against the CCSD(T)aug-cc-pVTZSDD results. The performance of proposed functional has been assessed for estimation of other response properties, such as dipole moment and excitation energy, for the same species. We then proceed to explore the validity of B2-PPW91 method for calculation of the dipole polarizability of some 5d transition metal monofluorides. In all cases, the improvement compared to common density functional methods and even previously reported double-hybrid functionals such as B2-PLYP and mPW2-PLYP has been observed. This indicates that the utility of double-hybrid density functional methods can be further extended to study linear and non-linear optical properties of transition metal containing molecules. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

The present algorithm, abbreviated EDIIS, is benchmarked against the direct inversion iterative subspace method based on the commutator of the density and Fock matrices developed by Pulay (DIIS). Our findings indicate that while EDIIS is able to rapidly bring the density matrix from any initial guess to a solution region, the DIIS method is faster when the density matrix is close to convergence. Consequently, we propose a combination of EDIIS and DIIS methods, which is both very robust and highly efficient. We also show how EDIIS can detect the presence and determine the value of fractional occupations in KS-DFT.},

First, for 16 small derivatives we compare the transition energies provided by the different wave function approaches to define theoretical best estimates. For this set, it surprisingly turned out that ADC(2) offers a better match with CC3 than ADC(3). Next, we use 10 functionals belonging to the "LYP" and "M06" families and compare the TD-DFT and the BSE/evGW descriptions. The BSE/evGW results are less sensitive than their TD-DFT counterparts to the selected functional, especially in the M06 series. Nevertheless, BSE/evGW delivers larger errors than TD-CAM-B3LYP, which provides extremely accurate results in the present case, especially when the Tamm-Dancoff approximation is applied. In addition, we show that, among the different starting points for BSE/evGW calculations, M06-2X eigenstates stand as the most appropriate. Finally, we confirm that the trends observed on the small compounds pertain in larger molecules.},

abstract = {Density fitting (DF), also known as the resolution of the identity (RI), is a widely used technique in quantum chemical calculations with various types of atomic basis sets-Gaussian-type orbitals, Slater-type orbitals, as well as numerical atomic orbitals-to speed up density functional, Hartree-Fock (HF), and post-HF calculations. Traditionally, custom auxiliary basis sets are hand-optimized for each orbital basis set; however, some automatic schemes have also been suggested. In this work, we propose a simple yet numerically stable automated scheme for forming auxiliary basis sets with the help of a pivoted Cholesky decomposition, which is applicable to any type of atomic basis function. We exemplify the scheme with proof-of-concept calculations with Gaussian basis sets and show that the proposed approach leads to negligible DF/RI errors in HF and second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) total energies of the non-multireference part of the W4-17 test set when used with orbital basis sets of at least polarized triple-$\zeta$ quality. The results are promising for future applications employing Slater-type orbitals or numerical atomic orbitals, as well as schemes based on the use of local fitting approaches. Global fitting approaches can also be used, in which case the high-angular-momentum functions produced by the present scheme can be truncated to minimize the computational cost.},

abstract = {Static correlation energies (Estat) are calculated in a range of basis sets for a chemically diverse collection of atoms and molecules. The reliability of a basis set in capturing Estat is assessed according to the following: mean and maximum absolute deviations from near-exact E stat estimates, monotonic convergence to the complete basis set limit, and ability to capture Estat accurately independent of changes in geometry, molecular size, and electronic configuration. Within the polarization and correlation-consistent basis set series, triple-$\zeta$ basis sets are the smallest that can reliably capture Estat. The cc-pVTZ basis set performs particularly well, recovering Estat to chemical accuracy for all atoms and molecules in our data set. A series of customized basis sets are constructed by stripping polarization functions from, and swapping polarization functions among, existing basis sets. Basis sets without polarization functions are incapable of accurately recovering Estat. Basis sets with a near-complete set of s, p, and d functions can approach chemical accuracy in maximum absolute error. However, this may be achieved at lower computational cost by using a well balanced triple-$\zeta$ basis set including f functions, along with a smaller number of s, p, and d functions. Recommended basis sets for calculating Estat with increasing accuracy at increasing computational cost are 6-311G(2d,2p), cc-pVTZ, and cc-pVQZ stripped of g functions. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

The CH3 NH3 PbI3 /MAPb(I1-x Clx)3 perovskites have dominated the field, while the similar CH3 NH 3 SnI3 has not been exploited for photovoltaic applications. Replacement of Pb by Sn would facilitate the large uptake of perovskite-based photovoltaics. Despite the extremely fast progress, the materials electronic properties which are key to the photovoltaic performance are relatively little understood. Density Functional Theory electronic structure methods have so far delivered an unbalanced description of Pb- and Sn-based perovskites. Here we develop an effective GW method incorporating spin-orbit coupling which allows us to accurately model the electronic, optical and transport properties of CH3 NH3 SnI3 and CH3 NH3 PbI3, opening the way to new materials design. The different CH3 NH3 SnI3 and CH 3 NH3 PbI3 electronic properties are discussed in light of their exploitation for solar cells, and found to be dominantly due to relativistic effects. These effects stabilize the CH3 NH 3 PbI3 material towards oxidation, by inducing a deeper valence band edge. Relativistic effects, however, also increase the material band-gap compared to CH3 NH3 SnI3, due to the valence band energy downshift (∼0.7 eV) being only partly compensated by the conduction band downshift (∼0.2 eV).},

Coulomb and exchange energy contributions are computed separately using specialized algorithms. A simple, yet effective integral screening protocol based on Schwarz estimates is used for the MP2 exchange energy. The Coulomb energy computation and the preceding transformations of the three-center integrals are accelerated using a modified version of the natural blocking approach [ Jung, Y.; Head-Gordon, M.

We compare three different ways of treating the spin-orbit interaction in calculating the quasiparticle energies: (i) The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is already incorporated in the noninteracting system that serves as starting point for the quasiparticle correction. (ii) The SOC is added in a second-variation approach only after the quasiparticle calculation has been performed in the absence of SOC. We found that the approximate treatment (ii) yields most quasiparticle bands with reasonable accuracy but does fail in the important band-gap region, where the SOC gives rise to a band inversion relevant for the topological properties of these materials. For example, Bi2Se3 is just on the brink of becoming a trivial semiconductor within this approximate approach, while it maintains its topological properties in the case of the consistent treatment (i). Finally, we consider another approach (iii), in which the SOC is included in the Green function G as in (i), but neglected in the calculation of the screened Coulomb potential W. This approach gives results in very good agreement with the full treatment (i), but with a smaller numerical effort. We conclude that, in the high-symmetry directions studied, bulk Bi2Se3 is a direct-gap and Bi2Te3 an indirect-gap semiconductor with band gaps of 0.20 and 0.19 eV, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

For small values of the interaction almost the entire information encoded in the vertex function corresponds to single-boson exchange processes, which can be represented in terms of the Hedin three-leg vertex and the screened interaction. Also for larger interaction, the single-boson exchange still captures scatterings between electrons and the dominant low-energy fluctuations and provides a unified description of the vertex asymptotics.

abstract = {The electronic structure of one of the nickelates (LaNiO2) and one of the cuprates (CaCuO2) is studied with three self-consistent GW-based methods: scGW, sc(GW+vertex), and quasiparticle self-consistent GW. Low-energy features obtained in our study are in many respects similar to the features reported in previous density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) studies. Consistent with the DFT+DMFT conclusion, we find LaNiO2 to be more correlated than CaCuO2. However, correlation effects included in our study change the DFT Fermi surface near the $\Gamma$ point differently from that reported in DMFT studies. Features that are a few electronvolts away from the Fermi level are broader in our calculations than in the DFT+DMFT, which reflects the differences between the DFT and the GW methods. Our results are in qualitative agreement with previous G0W0 results, but the self-consistency results in quantitative differences. Generally, correlation effects are found to be sufficiently weak in both materials, which allows one to use totally ab initio diagrammatic approaches such as sc(GW+vertex) and to avoid the methods with adjustable parameters (DFT+U or DFT+DMFT). However, the possibility of some strong correlations at low energy that cannot be captured by perturbative methods cannot be completely excluded. For instance, differences in the Fermi surface should be resolved, thus experimental studies are necessary.},

This approach employs the accurate wave functions of excitons, which are derived from the Bethe-Salpeter equation, in the donor and acceptor to set up the electronic coupling terms. Dexter coupling, which arises from the exchange-correlation effect, is evaluated based on the GW method which is a state-of-the-art ab initio theory for the description of self-energy. This approach is applicable to various situations, especially for periodic systems. The approach is tested on some model molecular dimers and compared with other high-level quantum chemistry methods together with the exact supermolecule scheme. Finally, we apply it to study the EET between periodic single-walled carbon nanotubes, exploring the dependence of EET on the chirality of nanotubes and the type of excitation transferred, finding that dark states play key roles in the EET between nanotubes. The EET rate falls as ∼D -12 approximately with the distance D between nanotubes for small D, much faster than the traditional F{\"{o}}rster model.},

Our study highlights the crucial role of dark states within the N band which are found to mediate B/Q state transfer, necessitating a treatment beyond Gouterman's classic four-orbital model. The sequential B → N → Q pathway dominates largely over the direct B → Q pathway which is found to be energetically unfavorable. Potential energy surface cuts and conical intersections between excited states are determined by TDDFT and validated by CASSCF/CASPT2 and XMCQDPT2 calculations. Both the static analysis and on-the-fly surface-hopping calculations suggest a pathway which involves minor structural deformations via in-plane vibrations. The B → N conversion is a barrierless adiabatic process occurring within ∼20 fs, while the subsequent N → Q conversion occurs via a conical intersection within ∼100 fs, in agreement with time-resolved experiments for porphine and related free base porphyrins. Furthermore, evidence for both sequential and direct transfer to the Qx and Qy states is obtained.},

abstract = {The major source of errror in most ab initio calculations of molecular energies is the truncation of the one-electron basis set. A complete basis set model chemistry is defined to include corrections for basis set truncation errors. This model uses double zeta plus polarization level atomic pair natural orbital basis sets to calculate molecular self-consistent-field (SCF) energies and correlation energies. The small corrections to give the complete basis set SCF energies are then estimated using the l-6 asymptotic convergence of the multicenter angular momentum expansion. The calculated correlation energies of the atoms He, Be, and Ne, and of the hydrides LiH, BH3, CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF, using the double zeta plus polarization basis sets vary from 83.0{\%} to 91.2{\%} of the experimental correlation energies. However, extrapolation of each of the pair energies and pair-coupling terms to the complete basis set values using the asymptotic convergence of pair natural orbital expansions retrieves from 99.5 ± 0.7{\%} to 101.1 ± 0.6{\%} of the experimental correlation energies for these atoms and molecules. With the exception of ammonia which gave 101.1{\%}, the calculated correlation energies agree with the experimental values to within the error limits of the experiments for all these atoms and molecules with more than four electrons. The total extrapolated energies (ESCF + E Correlation) are then in agreement with experiment to within ± 0.0014 hartree (root mean square deviation) and represent the most accurate total energy calculations yet reported for the molecules. The largest discrepancies with experiment occur for methane, where we obtain E Total = - 40.5112 hartree compared to EExpt = - 40.514 ± 0.002 hartree, and ammonia, where we obtain ETotal = - 56.5659 hartree compared to EExpt = - 56.563 ± 0.002 hartree. {\textcopyright} 1988 American Institute of Physics.},

This paper reports on four instructors with varying motivations and course contexts and the value they found in adopting PI. Although there are many documented benefits of PI for students (e.g. increased learning), here we describe the experience of the instructor by looking in detail at one particular question they posed in class. Through discussion of the instructors' experiences in their classrooms, we support educators in consideration of whether they would like to have similar classroom experiences. Our primary findings show instructors appreciate that PI assists students in addressing course concepts at a deep level, assists instructors in dynamically adapting their class to address student misunderstandings and, overall, that PI encourages students to be engaged in conversations which help build technical communication skills. We propose that using PI to engage students in these activities can effectively support training in analysis and teamwork skills. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

Ground-state properties of solids have been extensively investigated for several decades within the standard density functional theory. Excited-state properties, on the other hand, were relatively unexplored in ab initio calculations until a decade ago. The most suitable approach up to now for studying excited-state properties of extended systems is the Green function method. To calculate the Green function one requires the self-energy operator which is non-local and energy dependent. In this article we describe the GW approximation which has turned out to be a fruitful approximation to the self-energy. The Green function theory, numerical methods for carrying out the self-energy calculations, simplified schemes, and applications to various systems are described. Self-consistency issue and new developments beyond the GW approximation are also discussed as well as the success and shortcomings of the GW approximation.},

PauliNet has a multireference Hartree–Fock solution built in as a baseline, incorporates the physics of valid wavefunctions and is trained using variational quantum Monte Carlo. PauliNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art variational ansatzes for atoms, diatomic molecules and a strongly correlated linear H10, and matches the accuracy of highly specialized quantum chemistry methods on the transition-state energy of cyclobutadiene, while being computationally efficient.

DFT is less computationally demanding than other computational methods with a similar accuracy, being able to include electron correlation in the calculations at a fraction of time of post-Hartree-Fock methodologies. In this review we provide a brief outline of the density functional theory and of the historic development of the field, focusing later on the several types of density functionals currently available, and finishing with a detailed analysis of the performance of DFT across a wide range of chemical properties and system types, reviewed from the most recent benchmarking studies, which encompass several well-established density functionals together with the most recent efforts in the field. Globally, an overall picture of the level of performance of the plethora of currently available density functionals for each chemical property is drawn, with particular attention being dedicated to the relative performance of the popular B3LYP density functional.},

abstract = {Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is widely used in the study of linear response properties of finite systems. However, there are difficulties in properly describing excited states, which have double- and higher-excitation characters, which are particularly important in molecules with an open-shell ground state. These states would be described if the exact TDDFT kernel were used; however, within the adiabatic approximation to the exchange-correlation (xc) kernel, the calculated excitation energies have a strict single-excitation character and are fewer than the real ones. A frequency-dependent xc kernel could create extra poles in the response function, which would describe states with a multiple-excitation character. We introduce a frequency-dependent xc kernel, which can reproduce, within TDDFT, double excitations in finite systems. In order to achieve this, we use the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a dynamically screened Coulomb interaction W ($\omega$), which can describe these excitations, and from this we obtain the xc kernel. Using a two-electron model system, we show that the frequency dependence of W does indeed introduce the double excitations that are instead absent in any static approximation of the electron-hole screening. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

Here, we present a fragment-based GW implementation that can be applied to a D/A interface structure and thus enables accurate determination of the CT states. The implementation is based on the fragmentation approximation of the polarization function and the combined GW and Coulomb-hole plus screened exchange approximations for self-energies. The fragment-based GW is demonstrated by application to the pentacene/C60 interface structure containing more than 2000 atoms. The CT excitation energies were estimated from the quasiparticle energies and electron-hole screened Coulomb interactions; the computed energies are in reasonable agreement with experimental estimates from the external quantum efficiency measurements. We highlight the impact of the induced polarization effects on the electron-hole energetics. The proposed fragment-based GW method offers a first-principles tool to compute the quasiparticle energies and electronic excitation energies of organic materials.},

abstract = {Global hybrids, which add a typically modest fraction of the exact exchange energy to a complement of semilocal exchange-correlation energy, are among the most widely used density functionals in chemistry and condensed matter physics. Here we briefly review the formal and practical advantages and disadvantages of global hybrids. We point out that empiricism seems unavoidable in the construction of global hybrids, as it is not for most other kinds of density functional. Then we use one to three parameters to hybridize many semilocal functionals (including recently developed nonempirical generalized gradient approximations or GGA's and meta-GGA's). We study the performance of these global hybrids for many properties of spbonded molecules composed from the lighter atoms of the periodic table: atomization energies, barrier heights, reaction energies, enthalpies of formation, total energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, proton affinities, and equilibrium bond lengths. We find several new global hybrids that perform better in these tests than standard ones, and we correct some errors in literature assessments. We also discuss the representativity of small fitting sets and the adequacy of various Gaussian basis sets. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The density functional definition of exchange and correlation differs from the traditional one. In order to calculate the density functional theory (DFT), quantities accurately, molecular Kohn-Sham (KS) solutions have been obtained from ab initio wave functions for the homonuclear diatomic molecules Li2, N2, F2. These afford the construction of the KS determinant $\psi$s and the calculation of its total electronic energy EKS and the kinetic, nuclear-attraction and Coulomb repulsion components Ts, V, WH as well as the (DFT) exchange energy Ex and correlation energy Ec. Comparison of these DFT quantities has been made on one hand with the corresponding Hartree-Fock (HF) quantities and on the other hand with local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Comparison with HF shows that the correlation errors in the components T, V, and WH of the total energy are much larger for HF than KS determinantal wave functions. However, the total energies EKS and EHF appear to be close to each other, as well as the exchange energies Ex and EHFx and correlation energies Ec and EHFc. The KS determinantal wave function and the KS orbitals therefore correspond to much improved kinetic and Coulombic energies, while having only a slightly larger total correlation energy. It is stressed that these properties of the Kohn-Sham orbitals make them very suitable for use in the molecular orbital theories of chemistry. Comparison of the accurate Kohn-Sham exchange and correlation energies with LDA and GGA shows that the GGA exchange energies are consistently too negative, while the GGA correlation energies are not negative enough. It is argued that the GGA exchange functional represent effectively not only exchange, but also the molecular non-dynamical correlation, while the GGA correlation functionals represent dynamical correlation only. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Carter-Fenk2021,
abstract = {ConspectusAlthough sometimes derided as "weak"interactions, non-covalent forces play a critical role in ligand binding and crystal packing and in determining the conformational landscape of flexible molecules. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) provides a framework for accurate ab initio calculation of intermolecular interactions and furnishes a natural decomposition of the interaction energy into physically meaningful components: semiclassical electrostatics (rigorously obtained from monomer charge densities), Pauli or steric repulsion, induction (including both polarization and charge transfer), and dispersion. This decomposition helps to foster deeper understanding of non-covalent interactions and can be used to construct transferable, physics-based force fields. Separability of the SAPT interaction energy also provides the flexibility to construct composite methods, a feature that we exploit to improve the description of dispersion interactions. These are challenging to describe accurately because they arise from nonlocal electron correlation effects that appear for the first time at second order in perturbation theory but are not quantitatively described at that level.As with all quantum-chemical methods, a major limitation of SAPT is nonlinear scaling of the computational cost with respect to system size. This cost can be significantly mitigated using "SAPT0(KS)", which incorporates monomer electron correlation by means of Kohn-Sham (KS) molecular orbitals from density functional theory (DFT), as well as by an "extended"theory called XSAPT, developed by the authors. XSAPT generalizes traditional dimer SAPT to many-body systems, so that a ligand-protein interaction (for example) can be separated into contributions from individual amino acids, reducing the cost of the calculation below that of even supramolecular DFT while retaining the accuracy of high-level ab initio quantum chemistry.This Account provides an overview of the SAPT0(KS) approach and the XSAPT family of methods. Several low-cost variants are described that provide accuracy approaching that of the best ab initio benchmarks yet are affordable enough to tackle ligand-protein binding and sizable host-guest complexes. These variants include SAPT+aiD, which uses ab initio atom-atom dispersion potentials ("+aiD") in place of second-order SAPT dispersion, and also SAPT+MBD, which incorporates many-body dispersion (MBD) effects that are important in the description of nanoscale materials. Applications to drug binding highlight the size-extensive nature of dispersion, which is not a weak interaction in large systems. Other applications highlight how a physics-based analysis can sometimes upend conventional wisdom regarding intermolecular forces. In particular, careful reconsideration of $\pi$-$\pi$interactions makes clear that the quadrupolar electrostatics (or "Hunter-Sanders") model of $\pi$-$\pi$stacking should be replaced by a "van der Waals model"in which conformational preferences arise from a competition between dispersion and Pauli repulsion. Our analysis also suggests that molecular shape, rather than aromaticity per se, is the key factor driving strong stacking interactions. Looking forward, we anticipate that XSAPT-based methods can play a role in screening of drug candidates and in materials design.},

Thus we emphasize the need to surpass this limit and shed light on the many-electron SIE.

abstract = {The relative energies of the YMPJ conformer database of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, with N- and C-termination, have been re-evaluated using explicitly correlated coupled cluster methods. Lower-cost ab initio methods such as MP2-F12 and CCSD-F12b actually are outperformed by double-hybrid DFT functionals; in particular, the DSD-PBEP86-NL double hybrid performs well enough to serve as a secondary standard. Among range-separated hybrids, $\omega$B97X-V performs well, while B3LYP-D3BJ does surprisingly well among traditional DFT functionals. Treatment of dispersion is important for the DFT functionals; for the YMPJ set, D3BJ generally works as well as the NL nonlocal dispersion functional. Basis set sensitivity for DFT calculations on these conformers is weak enough that def2-TZVP is generally adequate. For conformer corrections to heats of formation, B3LYP-D3BJ and especially DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ or DSD-PBEP86-NL are adequate for all but the most exacting applications. The revised geometries and energetics for the YMPJ database have been made available as Supporting Information and should be useful in the parametrization and validation of molecular mechanics force fields and other low-cost methods. The very recent dRPA75 method yields good performance, without resorting to an empirical dispersion correction, but is still outperformed by DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ and particularly DSD-PBEP86-NL. Core-valence corrections are comparable in importance to improvements beyond CCSD(T∗)/cc-pVDZ-F12 in the valence treatment.},

abstract = {We discuss a parameter-free and computationally efficient ab initio simulation approach for moderately and strongly correlated materials, the multitier self-consistent GW+EDMFT method. This scheme treats different degrees of freedom, such as high-energy and low-energy bands, or local and nonlocal interactions, within appropriate levels of approximation, and provides a fully self-consistent description of correlation and screening effects in the solid. The ab initio input is provided by a one-shot G0W0 calculation, while the strong-correlation effects originating from narrow bands near the Fermi level are captured by a combined GW plus extended dynamical mean-field (EDMFT) treatment. We present the formalism and technical details of our implementation and discuss some general properties of the effective EDMFT impurity action. In particular, we show that the retarded impurity interactions can have noncausal features, while the physical observables, such as the screened interactions of the lattice system, remain causal. As a first application, we present ab initio simulation results for SrMoO3, which demonstrate the existence of prominent plasmon satellites in the spectral function not obtainable within LDA+DMFT, and provide further support for our recent reinterpretation of the satellite features in the related cubic perovskite SrVO3. We then turn to stretched sodium as a model system to explore the performance of the multitier self-consistent GW+EDMFT method in situations with different degrees of correlation. While the results for the physical lattice spacing a0 show that the scheme is not very accurate for electron-gas-like systems, because nonlocal corrections beyond GW are important, it does provide physically correct results in the intermediate correlation regime, and a Mott transition around a lattice spacing of 1.5a0. Remarkably, even though the Wannier functions in the stretched compound are less localized, and hence the bare interaction parameters are reduced, the self-consistently computed impurity interactions show the physically expected trend of an increasing interaction strength with increasing lattice spacing.},

abstract = {In this communication, an improved perturbative triples correction (T) algorithm for domain based local pair-natural orbital singles and doubles coupled cluster (DLPNO-CCSD) theory is reported. In our previous implementation, the semi-canonical approximation was used and linear scaling was achieved for both the DLPNO-CCSD and (T) parts of the calculation. In this work, we refer to this previous method as DLPNO-CCSD(T0) to emphasize the semi-canonical approximation. It is well-established that the DLPNO-CCSD method can predict very accurate absolute and relative energies with respect to the parent canonical CCSD method. However, the (T0) approximation may introduce significant errors in absolute energies as the triples correction grows up in magnitude. In the majority of cases, the relative energies from (T0) are as accurate as the canonical (T) results of themselves. Unfortunately, in rare cases and in particular for small gap systems, the (T0) approximation breaks down and relative energies show large deviations from the parent canonical CCSD(T) results. To address this problem, an iterative (T) algorithm based on the previous DLPNO-CCSD(T0) algorithm has been implemented [abbreviated here as DLPNO-CCSD(T)]. Using triples natural orbitals to represent the virtual spaces for triples amplitudes, storage bottlenecks are avoided. Various carefully designed approximations ease the computational burden such that overall, the increase in the DLPNO-(T) calculation time over DLPNO-(T0) only amounts to a factor of about two (depending on the basis set). Benchmark calculations for the GMTKN30 database show that compared to DLPNO-CCSD(T0), the errors in absolute energies are greatly reduced and relative energies are moderately improved. The particularly problematic case of cumulene chains of increasing lengths is also successfully addressed by DLPNO-CCSD(T).},

abstract = {The question of spatial locality of electronic correlations beyond GW approximation is one of the central issues of the famous combination of GW and dynamical mean field theory, GW+DMFT. In this work, the above question is addressed directly (for the first time) by performing calculations with and without assumption of locality of the corresponding diagrams. For this purpose we use sc(GW+G3W2) approach where the higher order part (G3W2) is evaluated with fully momentum dependent Green's function G and screened interaction W and with "local" variant, where the single site approximation is assumed for both G and W. For all three materials studied in this work (NiO, {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-Ce, LiFeAs), we have found the spatial non-locality effects to be strong. For NiO and LiFeAs they, in fact, are decisive for the proper evaluation of vertex corrections. The results of this study have direct impact on our understanding of approximations made in practical implementations of GW+DMFT method, where all diagrams beyond GW (DMFT part) are assumed to be local. Taking into account the fact that the first diagrams beyond GW represent the most important contribution also in GW+DMFT calculations, we conclude that the basic assumption of GW+DMFT, namely the locality of diagrams evaluated in the DMFT part, is not as good as it is believed to be.},

abstract = {Approximate functionals used in practical density functional theory (DFT) deviate from the piecewise linear behavior of the exact functional for fractional charges. This deviation causes excess charge delocalization, which leads to incorrect densities, molecular properties, barrier heights, band gaps, and excitation energies. We present a simple delocalization function for characterizing this error and find it to be almost perfectly linear vs the fractional electron number for systems spanning in size from the H atom to the C12H14 polyene. This causes the delocalization energy error to be a quadratic polynomial in the fractional electron number, which permits us to assess the comparative performance of 47 popular and recent functionals through the curvature. The quadratic form further suggests that information about a single fractional charge is sufficient to eliminate the principal source of delocalization error. Generalizing traditional two-point information like ionization potentials or electron affinities to account for a third, fractional charge-based data point could therefore permit fitting/tuning of functionals with lower delocalization error.},

abstract = {The electronic conductance of a benzene molecule connected to gold electrodes via thiol, thiolate, or amino anchoring groups is calculated using nonequilibrium Green functions in combination with the fully self-consistent GW approximation for exchange and correlation. The calculated conductance of benzenedithiol and benzenediamine is one-fifth that predicted by standard density functional theory (DFT), in very good agreement with experiments. In contrast, the widely studied benzenedithiolate structure is found to have a significantly higher conductance due to the unsaturated sulfur bonds. These findings suggest that more complex gold-thiolate structures where the thiolate anchors are chemically passivated by Au adatoms are responsible for the measured conductance. Analysis of the energy level alignment obtained with DFT, Hartree-Fock, and GW reveals the importance of self-interaction corrections (exchange) on the molecule and dynamical screening at the metal-molecule interface. The main effect of the GW self-energy is to renormalize the level positions; however, its influence on the shape of molecular resonances also affects the conductance. Non-self-consistent G0W0 calculations, starting from either DFT or Hartree-Fock, yield conductance values within 50{\%} of the self-consistent GW results. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Semi-local density functional theory suggests a connection between static correlation and self-interaction. It is difficult to make such a connection from the wave function theory perspective, since few wave function methods permit self-interaction error. However, the random phase approximation for ground-state correlation, which has a wave function derivation, does include self-interaction in its direct (Hartree) variant. This variant also describes left-right correlation. The self-interaction can be removed by means of second-order screened exchange; however, this also has negative consequences for the description of static correlation. This paper discusses the connection between the two concepts (static correlation and self-interaction) from the perspective provided by the random phase approximation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {The scope of problems treatable by ab initio wavefunction methods has expanded greatly through the application of local approximations. In particular, atomic orbital (AO) based wavefunction methods have emerged as powerful techniques for exploiting sparsity and have been applied to biomolecules as large as 1707 atoms [S. A. Maurer, D. S. Lambrecht, D. Flaig, and C. Ochsenfeld, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 144107 (2012)]. Correlated wavefunction methods, however, converge notoriously slowly to the basis set limit and, excepting the use of large basis sets, will suffer from a severe basis set incompleteness error (BSIE). The use of larger basis sets is prohibitively expensive for AO basis methods since, for example, second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) scales linearly with the number of atoms, but still scales as O(N(5)) in the number of functions per atom. Explicitly correlated F12 methods have been shown to drastically reduce BSIE for even modestly sized basis sets. In this work, we therefore explore an atomic orbital based formulation of explicitly correlated MP2-F12 theory. We present working equations for the new method, which produce results identical to the widely used molecular orbital (MO) version of MP2-F12 without resorting to a delocalized MO basis. We conclude with a discussion of several possible approaches to a priori screening of contraction terms in our method and the prospects for a linear scaling implementation of AO-MP2-F12. The discussion includes concrete examples involving noble gas dimers and linear alkane chains.},

abstract = {The performance of the second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory MP2.5 and MP2.X methods, tested on the S22, S66, X40, and other benchmark datasets is briefly reviewed. It is found that both methods produce highly accurate binding energies for the complexes contained in these data sets. Both methods also provide reliable potential energy curves for the complexes in the S66 set. Among the routinely used wavefunction methods, the only other technique that consistently produces lower errors, both for stabilization energies and geometry scans, is the spin-component-scaled coupled-clusters method covering iterative single- and double-electron excitations, which is, however, substantially more computationally intensive. The structures originated from full geometrical gradient optimizations at the MP2.5 and MP2.X level of theory were confirmed to be the closest to the CCSD(T)/CBS (coupled clusters covering iterative single- and double-electron excitations and perturbative triple-electron excitations performed at the complete basis set limit) geometries among all the tested methods (e.g. MP3, SCS(MI)-MP2, MP2, M06-2X, and DFT-D method evaluated with the TPSS functional). The MP2.5 geometries for the tested complexes deviate from the references almost negligibly. Inclusion of the scaled third-order correlation energy results in a substantial improvement of the ability to accurately describe noncovalent interactions. The results shown here serve to support the notion that MP2.5 and MP2.X are reasonable alternative methods for benchmark calculations in cases where system size or (lack of) computational resources preclude the use of CCSD(T)/CBS computations. MP2.X allows for the use of smaller basis sets (i.e. 6-31G*) with results that are nearly identical to those of MP2.5 with larger basis sets, which dramatically decreases computation times and makes calculations on much larger systems possible.

@article{Martin1959,
abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers dealing with many-particle systems from a unified, nonperturbative point of view. It contains derivations and discussions of various field-theoretical techniques which will be applied in subsequent papers. In a short introduction the general method of approach is summarized, and its relationship to other field-theoretic problems indicated. In the second section the macroscopic properties of the spectra of many-particle systems are described. Asymptotic evaluations are performed which characterize these macroscopic features in terms of intensive parameters, and the relationship of these parameters to thermodynamics is discussed. The special characteristics of the ground state are shown to follow as a limiting case of the asymptotic evaluations. The third section is devoted to the time-dependent field correlation functions, or Green's functions, which describe the microscopic behavior of a multiparticle system. These functions are defined, and related to intensive macroscopic variables when the energy and number of particles are large. Spectral representations and other properties of various one-particle Green's functions are derived. In the fourth section the treatment of non-equilibrium processes is considered. As a particular example, the electromagnetic properties of a system are expressed in terms of the special two-particle Green's function which describes current correlation. The discussion yields specifically a fluctuation-dissipation theorem, a sum rule for conductivity, and certain dispersion relations. The fifth section deals with the differential equations which determine the Green's functions. The boundary conditions that characterize the Green's function equations are exhibited without reference to adiabatic decoupling. A method for solving the equations approximately, by treating the correlations among successively larger numbers of particles, is considered. The first approximation in this sequence is shown to yield a generalized Hartree-like equation. A related, but rigorous, identity for the single-particle Green's function is then derived. A second approximation, which takes certain two-particle correlations into account, is shown to produce various additional effects: The interaction between particles is altered in a manner characterized by the intensive macroscopic parameters, and the modification and spread of the energy-momentum relation come into play. In the final section compact formal expressions for the Green's functions and other physical quantities are derived. Alternative equations and systematic approximations for the Green's functions are obtained. {\textcopyright} 1959 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Negative ions are not accurately represented in density functional approximations (DFAs) such as (semi)local density functionals (LDA or GGA or meta-GGA). This is caused by the much too high orbital energies (not negative enough) with these DFAs compared to the exact Kohn-Sham values. Negative ions very often have positive DFA HOMO energies, hence they are unstable. These problems do not occur with the exact Kohn-Sham potential, the anion HOMO energy then being equal to minus the electron affinity. It is therefore desirable to develop sufficiently accurate approximations to the exact Kohn-Sham potential. There are further beneficial effects on the orbital shapes and the density of using a good approximation to the exact KS potential. Notably the unoccupied orbitals are not unduly diffuse, as they are in the Hartree-Fock model, with hybrid functionals, and even with (semi)local density functional approximations (LDFAs). We show that the recently developed B-GLLB-VWN approximation [Gritsenko et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 144, 204114] to the exact KS potential affords stable negative ions with HOMO orbital energy close to minus the electron affinity.},

abstract = {The calculation of molecular electric moments, polarizabilities, and electrostatic potentials is a widespread application of quantum chemistry. Although a range of wave function and density functional theory (DFT) methods have been applied in these calculations, combined with a variety of basis sets, there has not been a comprehensive evaluation of how accurate these methods are. To benchmark the accuracy of these methods, the dipole moments and polarizabilities of a set of 46 molecules were calculated using a broad set of quantum chemical methods and basis sets. Wave function methods Hartree-Fock (HF), second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2), and coupled cluster-singles and doubles (CCSD) were evaluated, along with the PBE, TPSS, TPSSh, PBE0, B3LYP, M06, and B2PLYP DFT functionals. The cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVDZ, aug-cc-pVTZ, and Sadlej cc-pVTZ basis sets were tested. The aug-cc-pVDZ, Sadlej cc-pVTZ, and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets all yield results with comparable accuracy, with the aug-cc-pVTZ calculations being the most accurate. CCSD, MP2, or hybrid DFT methods using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set are all able to predict dipole moments with RMSD errors in the 0.12-0.13 D range and polarizabilities with RMSD errors in the 0.30-0.38 {\AA}3 range. Calculations using Hartree-Fock theory systematically overestimated dipole moments and underestimate polarizabilities. The pure DFT functionals included in this study (PBE and TPSS) slightly underestimate dipole moments and overestimate polarizability. Polarization anisotropy and implications for charge fitting are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A simple modification of second-order M{\o}ller–Plesset perturbation theory ͑MP2͒ to improve the description of molecular ground state energies is proposed. The total MP2 correlation energy is partitioned into parallel-and antiparallel-spin components which are separately scaled. The two parameters ͑scaling factors͒, whose values can be justified by basic theoretical arguments, have been optimized on a benchmark set of 51 reaction energies composed of 74 first-row molecules. It is found, that the new method performs significantly better than standard MP2: the rms ͓mean absolute error ͑MAE͔͒ deviation drops from 4.6 ͑3.3͒ to 2.3 ͑1.8͒ kcal/mol. The maximum error is reduced from 13.3 to 5.1 kcal/mol. Significant improvements are especially observed for cases which are usually known as MP2 pitfalls while cases already described well with MP2 remain almost unchanged. Even for 11 atomization energies not considered in the fit, uniform improvements ͓MAE: 8.1 kcal/mol ͑MP2͒ versus 3.2 kcal/mol ͑new͔͒ are found. The results are furthermore compared with those from density functional theory ͑DFT/B3LYP͒ and quadratic configuration interaction ͓QCISD/QCISD͑T͔͒ calculations. Also for difficult systems including strong ͑nondynamical͒ correlation effects, the improved MP2 method clearly outperforms DFT/B3LYP and yields results of QCISD or sometimes QCISD͑T͒ quality. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for ten diatomic molecules also show consistent enhancements. The uniformity with which the new method improves upon MP2, thereby rectifying many of its problems, indicates significant robustness and suggests it as a valuable quantum chemical method of general use.},

Key to the accuracy of the auxiliary density matrix methods (ADMM) is the use of a correction based on standard generalized gradient approximations for HFX. ADMM integrates seamlessly in existing HFX codes and, in particular, can be employed in linear scaling implementations. Demonstrating the performance of the method, the effect of HFX on the structure of liquid water is investigated in detail using Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations (300 ps) of a system of 64 molecules.

abstract = {The largest double-hybrid DFT study cleans up the ‘zoo' of non-empirical double hybrids and reveals their lack of general applicability. The development of non-empirical double-hybrid density functionals (DHDFs) is a very active research area with the number of approaches in this field having increased rapidly. At the same time, there is a lack of published work that provides a fair assessment and comparison between non-empirical and semi-empirical DHDFs on an equal footing. Herein, we close this gap and present a thorough analysis of both classes of DHDFs on the large GMTKN55 benchmark database for general main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions [Goerigk et al. , Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. , 2017, 19 , 32184–32215]. In total, 115 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected DHDFs are tested, which will be condensed to an in-depth assessment of 31 methods: 19 non-empirical and 12 semi-empirical DHDFs. As such, our study represents the largest DHDF study ever conducted and can serve as an important benchmark informing method developers and users alike. Our results show that semi-empirical DHDFs are the most robust density functional approximations and more reliable and accurate than non-empirical ones. In fact, some non-empirical approaches are even outperformed by hybrid approaches or even dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected MP2 and SCS-MP2. SOS0-PBE0-2-D3(BJ) is the only exception and the only non-empirical DHDF that we can safely recommend for general applicability. However, it is still outperformed by six semi-empirical DHDFs, of which we would like to particularly recommend the following five: $\omega$B97X-2-D3(BJ), DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), B2NC-PLYP-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). Our findings seriously question current trends in the field and they highlight that novel strategies have to be found in order to outperform the currently best density functional theory methods on the market. We hope that our study can function as an important cornerstone inspiring such a change of direction in the field. },

We propose a new variational fitting approach for Fock exchange that requires only the calculation of analytical three-center electron repulsion integrals. It relies on localized molecular orbitals and Hermite Gaussian auxiliary functions. The working equations along with a detailed description of the implementation are presented. The computational performance of the new algorithm is analyzed by benchmark calculations on systems with different dimensionality. Comparison with standard four-center and three-center electron repulsion integral Hartree-Fock calculations shows an excellent accuracy-performance relation.},

abstract = {While the breakdown of the perturbation expansion for the many-electron problem has several formal consequences, here we unveil its physical effect: flipping the sign of the effective electronic interaction in specific scattering channels. By decomposing local and uniform susceptibilities of the Hubbard model via their spectral representations, we prove how entering the nonperturbative regime causes an enhancement of the charge response, ultimately responsible for the phase-separation instabilities close to the Mott metal-insulator transition. Our analysis opens a new route for understanding phase transitions in the nonperturbative regime and clarifies why attractive effects emerging from a strong repulsion can induce phase separations but not s-wave pairing or charge-density wave instabilities.},

abstract = {We have simulated ionization of purine nucleic acid components in the gas phase and in a water environment. The vertical and adiabatic ionization processes were calculated at the PMP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level with the TDDFT method applied to obtain ionization from the deeper lying orbitals. The water environment was modeled via microsolvation approach and using a nonequilibrium polarizable continuum model. We have characterized a set of guanine tautomers and investigated nucleosides and nucleotides in different conformations. The results for guanine, i.e., the nucleic acid base with the lowest vertical ionization potential, were also compared to those for the other purine base, adenine. The main findings of our study are the following: (i) Guanine remains clearly the base with the lowest ionization energy even upon aqueous solvation. (ii) Water solvent has a strong effect on the ionization energetics of guanine and adenine and their derivatives; the vertical ionization potential (VIP) is lowered by about 1 eV for guanine while it is ∼1.5 eV higher in the nucleotides, overall resulting in similar VIPs for GMP-, guanosine and guanine in water. (iii) Water efficiently screens the electrostatic interactions between nucleic acid components. Consequently, ionization in water always originates from the base unit of the nucleic acid and all the information about conformational state is lost in the ionization energetics. (iv) The energy splitting between ionization of the two least bound electrons increases upon solvation. (v) Tautomerism does not contribute to the width of the photoelectron spectra in water. (vi) The effect of specific short-range interactions with individual solvent molecules is negligible for purine bases, compared to the long-range dielectric effects of the aqueous medium. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

We demonstrate the accuracy of this approach gives excitation energies within 0.01 eV of full EOM-CCSD, but with significantly reduced computational cost. This approach is also shown to be relatively invariant to the choice of functional used in the environment and allows for the description of systems with large numbers of basis functions ({\textgreater}1000) to be treated using state-of-the-art wave function methods. The flexibility of embedding to select orbitals to add to the excited-state method provides insights into the origins of the excitations and can reduce artifacts that could arise in traditional linear response time-dependent DFT (LR-TDDFT).},

This is confirmed by exploring transitions of various natures (local, charge-transfer, etc.) in a series of solvated molecules (acrolein, indigo, p-nitro-aniline, donor-acceptor complexes, etc.) for which we compare BSE solvatochromic shifts to those obtained by linear-response and state-specific TD-DFT implementations.

abstract = {Linear optical properties can be accurately calculated using the Bethe-Salpeter equation. After introducing a suitable product basis for the electron-hole pairs, the Bethe-Salpeter equation is usually recast into a complex non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem that is difficult to solve using standard eigenvalue solvers. In solid-state physics, it is therefore common practice to neglect the problematic coupling between the positive- and negative-frequency branches, reducing the problem to a Hermitian eigenvalue problem [Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA)]. We use time-inversion symmetry to recast the full problem into a quadratic Hermitian eigenvalue problem, which can be solved routinely using standard eigenvalue solvers even at a finite wave vector q. This allows us to access the importance of the coupling between the positive- and negative-frequency branch for prototypical solids. As a starting point for the Bethe-Salpeter calculations, we use self-consistent Green's-function methods (GW), making the present scheme entirely ab initio. We calculate the optical spectra of carbon (C), silicon (Si), lithium fluoride (LiF), and the cyclic dimer Li2F2 and discuss why the differences between the TDA and the full solution are tiny. However, at finite momentum transfer q, significant differences between the TDA and our exact treatment are found. The origin of these differences is explained.},

We compared the newly developed methods to other HMDFT and hybrid DFT methods for atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, barrier heights, saddle point geometries, hydrogen bonding, and weak van der Waals weak interactions. In addition, we optimized scaling factors for calculating zero-point energies from vibrational frequencies. The results show that the MPWB1K and XB1K methods give good results for thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, hydrogen bonding, and weak interactions, and they give excellent saddle point geometries.

abstract = {MP2 and CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS) limit interaction energies and geometries for more than 100 DNA base pairs, amino acid pairs and model complexes are for the first time presented together. Extrapolation to the CBS limit is done by using two-point extrapolation methods and different basis sets (aug-cc-pVDZ - aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVTZ - aug-cc-pVQZ, cc-pVTZ - cc-pVQZ) are utilized. The CCSD(T) correction term, determined as a difference between CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies, is evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G** and cc-pVDZ). Two sets of complex geometries were used, optimized or experimental ones. The JSCH-2005 benchmark set, which is now available to the chemical community, can be used for testing lower-level computational methods. For the first screening the smaller training set (S22) containing 22 model complexes can be recommended. In this case larger basis sets were used for extrapolation to the CBS limit and also CCSD(T) and counterpoise-corrected MP2 optimized geometries were sometimes adopted.},

Beside presenting vertical excitation energies for about 30 singlet transitions of four molecules, the results are analyzed statistically and problematic cases have been discussed in detail. It is concluded that the mean deviation of the CC2 results is smaller than that of the CCSD. However, the latter seems to be more systematic, i.e. it usually overestimates excitation energies by about 0.2 eV but with somewhat smaller standard deviation. Unfortunately, with decreasing single excitation contribution in the wave function CCSD gives large error, which can not be corrected by the non-iterative triples methods CCSDR(3) and EOM-CCSD(T).},

abstract = {We review the dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated electron systems which is based on a mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models subject to a self-consistency condition. This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

With these diagrammatic extensions of DMFT long-range charge, magnetic, and superconducting fluctuations as well as (quantum) criticality can be addressed in strongly correlated electron systems.

abstract = {A new intrinsic localization algorithm is suggested based on a recently developed mathematical measure of localization. No external criteria are used to define a priori bonds, lone pairs, and core orbitals. It is shown that the method similarly to Edmiston–Ruedenberg's localization prefers the well established chemical concept of $\sigma$–$\pi$ separation, while on the other hand, works as economically as Boys' procedure. For the application of the new localization algorithm, no additional quantities are to be calculated, the knowledge of atomic overlap intergrals is sufficient. This feature allows a unique formulation of the theory, adaptable for both ab initio and semiempirical methods, even in those cases where the exact form of the atomic basis functions is not defined (like in the EHT and PPP calculations). The implementation of the procedure in already existing program systems is particularly easy. For illustrative examples, we compare the Edmiston–Ruedenberg and Boys localized orbitals with those calculated by the method suggested here, within both the CNDO/2 and ab initio frameworks (using STO‐3G and 6‐31G∗∗ basis sets) for several molecules (CO, H2CO, B2H6, and N2O4).

In this process, we have designed a numerical method based on cubic splines, which appears to be superior to other techniques previously applied to the "inverse engineering problem" of DFT, i.e., the problem of finding an XC potential from a known particle density. The potentials we obtain do not suffer from unphysical ripple and have, to within a reasonable accuracy, the correct asymptotic tails outside localized systems. The XC potential is an important ingredient in finding the particle-conserving excitation energies in atoms and molecules, and our potentials perform better in this regard as compared to the local-density approximation potential, potentials from generalized gradient approximations, and a DFT potential based on MP2 theory. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {ConspectusRadiation damage to DNA is usually considered in terms of UVA and UVB radiation. These ultraviolet rays, which are part of the solar spectrum, can indeed cause chemical lesions in DNA, triggered by photoexcitation particularly in the UVB range. Damage can, however, be also caused by higher energy radiation, which can ionize directly the DNA or its immediate surroundings, leading to indirect damage. Thanks to absorption in the atmosphere, the intensity of such ionizing radiation is negligible in the solar spectrum at the surface of Earth. Nevertheless, such an ionizing scenario can become dangerously plausible for astronauts or flight personnel, as well as for persons present at nuclear power plant accidents. On the beneficial side, ionizing radiation is employed as means for destroying the DNA of cancer cells during radiation therapy.Quantitative information about ionization of DNA and its components is important not only for DNA radiation damage, but also for understanding redox properties of DNA in redox sensing or labeling, as well as charge migration along the double helix in nanoelectronics applications. Until recently, the vast majority of experimental and computational data on DNA ionization was pertinent to its components in the gas phase, which is far from its native aqueous environment. The situation has, however, changed for the better due to the advent of photoelectron spectroscopy in liquid microjets and its most recent application to photoionization of aqueous nucleosides, nucleotides, and larger DNA fragments.Here, we present a consistent and efficient computational methodology, which allows to accurately evaluate ionization energies and model photoelectron spectra of aqueous DNA and its individual components. After careful benchmarking, the method based on density functional theory and its time-dependent variant with properly chosen hybrid functionals and polarizable continuum solvent model provides ionization energies with accuracy of 0.2-0.3 eV, allowing for faithful modeling and interpretation of DNA photoionization. The key finding is that the aqueous medium is remarkably efficient in screening the interactions within DNA such that, unlike in the gas phase, ionization of a base, nucleoside, or nucleotide depends only very weakly on the particular DNA context. An exception is the electronic interaction between neighboring bases which can lead to sequence-specific effects, such as a partial delocalization of the cationic hole upon ionization enabled by presence of adjacent bases of the same type.},

We expect that this approach will also prove successful on the fourth and fifth rungs (hyper-GGA or hybrid and generalized random-phase approximation). In particular, we argue for the theoretical and practical importance of recovering the correct uniform density limit, which many semiempirical functionals fail to do. Among the beyond-LSD functionals now available to users, we recommend the nonempirical Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) GGA and the nonempirical Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS) meta-GGA, and their one-parameter hybrids with exact exchange. TPSS improvement over PBE is dramatic for atomization energies of molecules and surface energies of solids, and small or moderate for other properties. TPSS is now or soon will be available in standard codes such as GAUSSIAN, TURBOMOLE, NWCHEM, ADF, WIEN, VASP, etc. We also discuss old and new ideas to eliminate the self-interaction error that plagues the functionals on the first three rungs of the ladder, bring up other related issues, and close with a list of "do's and don't's" for software developers and users. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

When crossing symmetry is not imposed, the convergence of both simple iteration and more complicated continuous loading (homotopy) methods is limited to high temperatures and weak interactions. We modify the algorithm to impose the crossing symmetry without increasing the computational complexity. We also imposed time reversal and a subset of the point group symmetries, but they did not further improve the convergence. We elaborate the details of the latency hiding scheme which can significantly improve the performance in the computational implementation. With these modifications, stable solutions for the parquet equations can be obtained by iteration more quickly even for values of the interaction that are a significant fraction of the bandwidth and for temperatures that are much smaller than the bandwidth. This may represent a crucial step towards the solution of two-particle field theories for correlated electron models. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Precise theoretical calculations of non-adiabatic couplings, which describe the interaction between two Born-Oppenheimer surfaces, are important for the modeling of radiationless decay mechanisms in photochemical processes. Here, we demonstrate that accurate non-adiabatic couplings can be calculated in the framework of linear-response time-dependent density functional theory by using non-empirical, optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid (OT-RSH) functionals. We focus on molecular radicals, in which ultrafast non-radiative decay plays a crucial role, to find that the OT-RSH functional compares well to wave-function based reference data and competes with the accuracy of semi-empirical CAM-B3LYP calculations. Our findings show that the OT-RSH approach provides very accurate non-adiabatic couplings and, therefore, provides a computationally efficient alternative to wave-function based techniques.},

abstract = {Given access to accurate solutions of the many-electron Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, nearly all chemistry could be derived from first principles. Exact wave functions of interesting chemical systems are out of reach because they are NP-hard to compute in general, but approximations can be found using polynomially scaling algorithms. The key challenge for many of these algorithms is the choice of wave function approximation, or Ansatz, which must trade off between efficiency and accuracy. Neural networks have shown impressive power as accurate practical function approximators and promise as a compact wave-function Ansatz for spin systems, but problems in electronic structure require wave functions that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Here we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, the Fermionic neural network, as a powerful wave-function Ansatz for many-electron systems. The Fermionic neural network is able to achieve accuracy beyond other variational quantum Monte Carlo Ansatz on a variety of atoms and small molecules. Using no data other than atomic positions and charges, we predict the dissociation curves of the nitrogen molecule and hydrogen chain, two challenging strongly correlated systems, to significantly higher accuracy than the coupled cluster method, widely considered the most accurate scalable method for quantum chemistry at equilibrium geometry. This demonstrates that deep neural networks can improve the accuracy of variational quantum Monte Carlo to the point where it outperforms other ab initio quantum chemistry methods, opening the possibility of accurate direct optimization of wave functions for previously intractable many-electron systems.},

We examine the relative merits of ZINDO, CIS, TD-DFT (with the functionals PBE, BLYP, PBE0, B3LYP, and CAM-B3LYP) and RI-CC2 in reproducing the variations across the pigments that occur as a consequence of geometrical and electrostatic effects of the FMO complex by comparison to DFT-BHLYP/MRCI. We find that these pigments are near-multiconfigurational in nature and, thus, constitute critical cases for the RI-CC2 method. The commonly used ZINDO method is fairly reliable for the site energies of the isolated pigments; however, it overestimates the coupling to the environment, thereby leading to variations across the embedded pigments that are too drastic. The overall best performance is provided by the investigated TD-DFT methods, where PBE0 is found to be slightly superior to the other functionals tested. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Recently, we have constructed a dual-hybrid direct random phase approximation method, called dRPA75, and demonstrated its good performance on reaction energies, barrier heights, and noncovalent interactions of main-group elements. However, this method has also shown significant but quite systematic errors in the computed atomization energies. In this paper, we suggest a constrained spin-component scaling formalism for the dRPA75 method (SCS-dRPA75) in order to overcome the large error in the computed atomization energies, preserving the good performance of this method on spin-unpolarized systems at the same time. The SCS-dRPA75 method with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set results in an average error lower than 1.5 kcal mol-1 for the entire n-homodesmotic hierarchy of hydrocarbon reactions (RC0-RC5 test sets). The overall performance of this method is better than the related direct random phase approximation-based double-hybrid PWRB95 method on open-shell systems of main-group elements (from the GMTKN30 database) and comparable to the best O(N4)-scaling opposite-spin second-order perturbation theory-based double-hybrid methods like PWPB95-D3 and to the O(N5)-scaling RPAX2@PBEx method, which also includes exchange interactions. Furthermore, it gives well-balanced performance on many types of barrier heights similarly to the best O(N5)-scaling second-order perturbation theory-based or spin-component scaled second-order perturbation theory-based double-hybrid methods such as XYG3 or DSD-PBEhB95. Finally, we show that the SCS-dRPA75 method has reduced self-interaction and delocalization errors compared to the parent dRPA75 method and a slightly smaller static correlation error than the related PWRB95 method.},

abstract = {We derive variational expressions for the grand potential or action in terms of the many-body Green function G which describes the propagation of particles and the renormalized four-point vertex $\Gamma$ which describes the scattering of two particles in many-body systems. The main ingredient of the variational functionals is a term we denote as the $\Xi$ -functional which plays a role analogously to the usual $\Phi$ -functional studied by Baym in connection with the conservation laws in many-body systems. We show that any $\Xi$ -derivable theory is also $\Phi$ -derivable and therefore respects the conservation laws. We further set up a computational scheme to obtain accurate total energies from our variational functionals without having to solve computationally expensive sets of self-consistent equations. The input of the functional is an approximate Green function G⌈ and an approximate four-point vertex $\Gamma$⌈ obtained at a relatively low computational cost. The variational property of the functional guarantees that the error in the total energy is only of second order in deviations of the input Green function and vertex from the self-consistent ones that make the functional stationary. The functionals that we will consider for practical applications correspond to infinite order summations of ladder and exchange diagrams and are therefore particularly suited for applications to highly correlated systems. Their practical evaluation is discussed in detail. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

The hydrogen-based energy system is presented as four corners (stages) of a square shaped integrated whole to demonstrate the interconnection and interdependency of these main stages. The hydrogen production pathway and specific technology selection are dependent on the type of energy and feedstock available as well as the end-use purity required. Hence, purification technologies are included in the production pathways for system integration, energy storage, utilisation or RE export. Hydrogen production pathways and associated technologies are reviewed in this paper for their interconnection and interdependence on the other corners of the hydrogen square. Despite hydrogen being zero-carbon-emission energy at the end-use point, it depends on the cleanness of the production pathway and the energy used to produce it. Thus, the guarantee of hydrogen origin is essential to consider hydrogen as clean energy. An innovative model is introduced as a hydrogen cleanness index coding for further investigation and development.},

Accordingly, in multicenter integrals, B functions seem to have much more attractive properties than STFs. We demonstrate this by analyzing shifting operators which make it possible to increase quantum numbers of the orbitals. Again we find that the shifting operators of B functions can be applied much more easily and yield much more compact results than the corresponding operators for STFs.

abstract = {The light harvesting complex II (LHCII), is a pigment-protein complex responsible for most of the light harvesting in plants. LHCII harvests sunlight and transfers excitation energy to the reaction centre of the photo-system, where the water oxidation process takes place. The energetics of LHCII can be modulated by means of conformational changes allowing a switch from a harvesting to a quenched state. In this state, the excitation energy is no longer transferred but converted into thermal energy to prevent photooxidation. Based on molecular dynamics simulations at the microsecond time scale, we have recently proposed that the switch between different fluorescent states can be probed by correlating shifts in the chromophore-chromophore Coulomb interactions to particular protein movements. However, these findings are based upon calculations in the ideal point dipole approximation (IDA) where the Coulomb couplings are simplified as first order dipole-dipole interactions, also assuming that the chromophore transition dipole moments lay in particular directions of space with constant moduli (FIX-IDA). In this work, we challenge this approximation using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) combined with the frozen density embedding (FDE) approach. Our aim is to establish up to which limit FIX-IDA can be applied and which chromophore types are better described under this approximation. For that purpose, we use the classical trajectories of solubilised light harvesting complex II (LHCII) we have recently reported [Liguori et al., Sci. Rep., 2015, 5, 15661] and selected three pairs of chromophores containing chlorophyll and carotenoids (Chl and Car): Chla611-Chla612, Chlb606-Chlb607 and Chla612-Lut620. Using the FDE in the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (FDEc-TDA), we show that IDA is accurate enough for predicting Chl-Chl Coulomb couplings. However, the FIX-IDA largely overestimates Chl-Car interactions mainly because the transition dipole for the Cars is not trivially oriented on the polyene chain.},

abstract = {Many‐body (diagrammatic) perturbation theory (MBPT), coupled‐pair many‐electron theory (CPMET), and configuration interaction (CI) are investigated with particular emphasis on the importance of quadruple excitations in correlation theories. These different methods are used to obtain single, double, and quadruple excitation contributions to the correlation energy for a series of molecules including CO2, HCN, N2, CO, BH3, and NH3. It is demonstrated that the sum of double and quadruple excitation diagrams through fourth‐order perturbation theory is usually quite close to the CPMET result for these molecules at equilibrium geometries. The superior reliability of the CPMET model as a function of internuclear separation is illustrated by studying the 1∑ g+ potential curve of Be2. This molecule violates the assumption common to nondegenerate perturbation theory that only a single reference function is important and this causes improper behavior of the potential curve as a function of R. This is resolved once the quadruple excitation terms are fully included by CPMET. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1978 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

Here, we assess the performance of these methods for benzene, pyridine, and the diazines.

In this article the fundamental properties of the already known hydrogenic orbitals (the familiar polar, the parabolic, and the rarely treated spheroidal sets) are resumed; then, we discuss some properties of the spheroelliptic orbitals, which have been so far practically ignored. We pay particular attention to the symmetries of the different orbital sets and to the relationships between them and order them in a complete scheme that exhibits passages from one to the other through explicitly derived orthogonal transformations. Within this context we insert the study on the conservation of parity in the passage from the polar set to the parabolic one. We also show that - except for the spheroidal set - all alternatives for hydrogenic wave functions induce irreducible representations of the point group D2h, the "quaternion group." This has relevance for the discussion of connections between these sets and the corresponding ones in momentum space, presented in the following installment of this series.},

abstract = {Despite their vast importance to inorganic chemistry, materials science, and catalysis, the accuracy of modeling the formation or cleavage of metal-ligand (M-L) bonds depends greatly on the chosen functional and the type of bond in a way that is not systematically understood. In order to approach a state of high-accuracy DFT for rational prediction of chemistry and catalysis, such system-dependencies need to be resolved. We studied 30 different density functionals applied to a "balanced data set" of 60 experimental diatomic M-L bond energies; this data set has no bias toward any dq configuration, metal, bond type, or ligand as all of these occur to the same extent, and we can therefore identify accuracy bottlenecks. We show that the performance of a functional is very dependent on data set choice, and we dissect these effects into system type. In addition to the use of balanced data sets, we also argue that the precision (rather than just accuracy) of a functional is of interest, measured by standard deviations of the errors. There are distinct system dependencies both in the ligand and metal series: Hydrides are best described by a very large HF exchange percentage, possibly due to self-interaction error, whereas halides are best described by very small (0-10{\%}) HF exchange fractions, and double-bond enforcing oxides and sulfides favor 10-25{\%} HF exchange, as is also average for the full data set. Thus, average HF requirements hide major system-dependent requirements. For late transition metals Co-Zn, HF percentage of 0-10{\%} is favored, whereas for the early transition metals Sc-Fe hybrid functionals with 20{\%} HF exchange or higher are commonly favored. Accordingly, B3LYP is an excellent choice for early d-block but a poor choice for late transition metals. We conclude that DFT intrinsically underestimates the bond strengths of late vs early transition metals, correlating with increased effective nuclear charge. Thus, the revised RPBE, which reduces the overbinding tendency of PBE, is mainly an advantage for the early and mid transition metals and not very much for the late transition metals, i.e. there is a metal-dependent effect of the relative performance of RPBE vs PBE, which are widely used to study adsorption energetics on metal surfaces. Overall, the best performing functionals are PW6B95, the MN15 and MN15-L functionals, and the double hybrid B2PLYP.},

abstract = {The light-harvesting chlorophyll (Chl) molecules of photosynthetic systems form the basis for light-driven energy conversion. In biological environments, the Chl chromophores occur in two distinct diastereotopic configurations, where the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ configurations have a magnesium-ligating histidine residue and a 17-propionic acid moiety on the opposite side or on the same side of the Chl ring, respectively. Although $\beta$-ligated Chl dimers occupy conserved positions around the reaction center of photosystem I (PSI), the functional relevance of the $\alpha$/$\beta$ configuration of the ligation is poorly understood. We employ here correlated ab initio calculations using the algebraic-diagrammatic construction through second order (ADC(2)) and the approximate second-order coupled cluster (CC2) methods in combination with the reduced virtual space (RVS) approach in studies of the intrinsic excited-state properties of $\alpha$-ligated and $\beta$-ligated Chl dimers of PSI. Our ab initio calculations suggest that the absorption of the $\alpha$-ligated reaction-center Chl dimer of PSI is redshifted by 0.13-0.14 eV in comparison to the $\beta$-ligated dimers due to combined excitonic coupling and strain effects. We also show that time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations using range-separated density functionals underestimate the absorption shift between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-ligated dimers. Our findings may provide a molecular starting point for understanding the energy flow in natural photosynthetic systems, as well as a blueprint for developing new molecules that convert sunlight into other forms of energy.},

abstract = {An expression for the "correlation energy" of a multiconfiguration wave function is developed using perturbation theory. The asymptotic form of this expression for an N-configuration pair natural orbital expansion is Error(N×N)≃($\Sigma$$\mu$=1NC$\mu$)2 (-225/4608)N-1. The asymptotic form attributes the dominant variation in multiconfiguration pair correlation errors to an interference effect between low-lying natural orbitals. Three levels of extrapolation based on the asymptotic convergence of pair natural orbital expansions are examined. The first requires separate calculations with 5 and 14 natural orbitals. When applied to the helium atom, for which E(5)=-2.897 484 and E(14)=-2.901 697, the extrapolated value, E=- 2.903 724, is accurate to within 0.05{\%} of the error from the 14 natural orbital wave function (i.e., the absolute accuracy is ≲0.000001 hartree). The second extrapolation requires separate calculations with 5 and 14 pair MCSCF configurations and is accurate to within 2{\%} of the MCSCF (14) error (i.e., the absolute accuracy is ≲0.00005 hartree) for the helium isoelectronic series. The third extrapolation requires only the 5-configuration MCSCF calculation. This extrapolation is accurate to ∼10{\%} of the MCSCF (5) error (i.e., the absolute accuracy is ∼0.0005 hartree) for the cases examined, including CH2, Ne, He, and H2. This is comparable to the accuracy of an MCSCF calculation including ten times as many natural orbitals (which would require a factor of ∼104 more computing time). {\textcopyright} 1981 American Institute of Physics.},

The highest occupied molecular orbital energies of atoms obtained from both GW@HF and QSGW are in excellent agreement with the experimental ionization energy. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies of the singly charged cation yield a noticeably worse estimate of the ionization energy. The best agreement with respect to experiment is obtained from the total energy differences within the random phase approximation functional, which is the total energy corresponding to the GW self-energy.

It is shown that this condition implies that the wave function can be continued analytically to complex values of the "relative time" variable; similarly the wave function in momentum space can be continued analytically to complex values of the "relative energy" variable p0. In particular one is allowed to consider the wave function for purely imaginary values of t, or respectively p0, i.e., for real values of x4=ict and p4=ip0. A wave equation satisfied by this function is obtained by rotation of the integration path in the complex plane of the variable p0, and it is further shown that the formulation of the eigenvalue problem in terms of this equation presents several advantages in that many of the ordinary mathematical methods become available. In an especially simple case ("ladder approximation" equation for two spinless particles bound by a scalar field of zero rest mass) an integral representation method is presented which allows one to reduce the problem exactly (and for arbitrary values of the total energy of the bound state) to an eigenvalue problem of the Sturm-Liouville type.

abstract = {The random-phase approximation (RPA) is exact for the exchange energy of a many-electron ground state, but RPA makes the correlation energy too negative by about 0.5 eV/electron. That large short-range error, which tends to cancel out of isoelectronic energy differences, is largely corrected by an exchange-correlation kernel, or (as in RPA+) by an additive local or semilocal correction. RPA+ is by construction exact for the homogeneous electron gas, and it is also accurate for the jellium surface. RPA+ often gives realistic total energies for atoms or solids in which spin-polarization corrections are absent or small. RPA and RPA+ also yield realistic singlet binding energy curves for H2 and N2, and thus RPA+ yields correct total energies even for spin-unpolarized atoms with fractional spins and strong correlation, as in stretched H2 or N2. However, RPA and RPA+ can be very wrong for spin-polarized one-electron systems (especially for stretched H2+), and also for the spin-polarization energies of atoms. The spin-polarization energy is often a small part of the total energy of an atom, but important for ionization energies, electron affinities, and the atomization energies of molecules. Here we propose a computationally efficient generalized RPA+ (gRPA+) that changes RPA+ only for spin-polarized systems by making gRPA+ exact for all one-electron densities, in the same simple semilocal way that the correlation energy densities of many metageneralized gradient approximations are made self-correlation free. By construction, gRPA+ does not degrade the exact RPA+ description of jellium. gRPA+ is found to greatly improve upon RPA and RPA+ for the ionization energies and electron affinities of light atoms. Many versions of RPA with an approximate exchange-correlation kernel fail to be exact for all one-electron densities, and they can also be self-interaction corrected in this way.},

abstract = {This paper describes an all-electron implementation of the self-consistent GW (sc-GW) approach -- i.e. based on the solution of the Dyson equation -- in an all-electron numeric atom-centered orbital (NAO) basis set. We cast Hedin's equations into a matrix form that is suitable for numerical calculations by means of i) the resolution of identity technique to handle 4-center integrals; and ii) a basis representation for the imaginary-frequency dependence of dynamical operators. In contrast to perturbative G0W0, sc-GW provides a consistent framework for ground- and excited-state properties and facilitates an unbiased assessment of the GW approximation. For excited-states, we benchmark sc-GW for five molecules relevant for organic photovoltaic applications: thiophene, benzothiazole, 1,2,5-thiadiazole, naphthalene, and tetrathiafulvalene. At self-consistency, the quasi-particle energies are found to be in good agreement with experiment and, on average, more accurate than G0W0 based on Hartree-Fock (HF) or density-functional theory with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional. Based on the Galitskii-Migdal total energy, structural properties are investigated for a set of diatomic molecules. For binding energies, bond lengths, and vibrational frequencies sc-GW and G0W0 achieve a comparable performance, which is, however, not as good as that of exact-exchange plus correlation in the random-phase approximation (EX+cRPA) and its advancement to renormalized second-order perturbation theory (rPT2). Finally, the improved description of dipole moments for a small set of diatomic molecules demonstrates the quality of the sc-GW ground state density.},

Consequently, excitation energies can be obtained to a good approximation by diagonalizing the transformed Hamiltonian in the space of single excitations only. The STEOM method is applied to obtain the valence excitation spectrum of the pyridine molecule. The accuracy of STEOM is shown to be comparable to current state of the art methods like equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory and CASPT2, whereas the computational requirements of STEOM are very modest compared to the above methods. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

For example, a fully polarized electronic system can be investigated by means of the algebra generated by the usual fermionic creation and annihilation operators, or by using the algebra of Pauli (spin-1/2) operators. The correspondence between the two algebras is given by the Jordan-Wigner isomorphism. As we previously noted similar one-to-one mappings enable one to represent any physical system in a quantum computer. In this paper we evolve and exploit this fundamental concept in quantum information processing to simulate generic physical phenomena by quantum networks.

The recent developments of small light sources, detectors, and fiber optic probes provide opportunities to quantitatively measure these interactions, which yield information for diagnosis at the biochemical, structural, or (patho)physiological level within intact tissues. However, because of the strong scattering properties of tissues, the reemitted optical signal is often influenced by changes in biochemistry (as detected by these spectroscopic approaches) and by physiological and pathophysiological changes in tissue scattering. One challenge of biomedical optics is to uncouple the signals influenced by biochemistry, which themselves provide specificity for identifying diseased states, from those influenced by tissue scattering, which are typically unspecific to a pathology. In this review, we describe optical interactions pursued for biomedical applications (fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime, phosphorescence, and Raman from cells, cultures, and tissues) and then provide a descriptive framework for light interaction based upon tissue absorption and scattering properties. Finally, we review important endogenous and exogenous biological chromophores and describe current work to employ these signals for detection and diagnosis of disease.},

This leads to a natural linear scaling coupled-cluster method (NLSCC), in which total correlation energies of extended systems are evaluated as the sum of correlation energy contributions from individual small subunits within that system. This is achieved by defining local occupied orbital correlation energies. These are quantities, which in the LMO basis become transferable between similar molecular fragments. Conventional small scale existing molecular CCSD codes are all that is needed, the local correlation effect being simply transmitted via the appropriate LMO basis. Linear scaling of electronic correlation energy calculations is thus naturally achieved using the NLSCC approach, which in principle can treat nonperiodic extended systems of infinite basis set size. Results are shown for alkanes and several polyglycine molecules and the latter compared to recent results obtained via an explicit large scale LCCSD calculation.

Interest in photoactive hybrid organic/inorganic systems has recently increased and so has the use of the BSE for computing neutral excitations of organic molecules. However, no systematic benchmarks of the BSE for neutral electronic excitations of organic molecules exist. Here, we study the performance of the BSE for the 28 small molecules in Thiel's widely used time-dependent density functional theory benchmark set [Schreiber et al., J. Chem.

We find that this starting point dependence is mainly introduced through the quasiparticle energies obtained at the intermediate GW step and that with a judicious choice of starting mean-field, singlet excitation energies obtained from BSE are in excellent quantitative agreement with higher-level wavefunction methods. The quality of the triplet excitations is slightly less satisfactory.},

The cost differential between complete basis set (CBS) and small basis MP2 restricts system sizes where BSSE can be removed. Range-separation of MP2 could yield more tractable and/or accurate forms for short- and long-range correlation. Retaining only short-range contributions proves to be effective for MP2 in the small aug-cc-pVDZ (aDZ) basis. Using one range-separation parameter, superior behavior is obtained versus both MP2/aDZ and MP2/CBS for inter- and intramolecular test sets. Attenuation of the long-range helps to cancel both BSSE and intrinsic MP2 errors. Direct scaling of the MP2 correlation energy proves useful as well. The resulting SMP2/aDZ, MP2(erfc, aDZ), and MP2(terfc, aDZ) methods perform far better than MP2/aDZ across systems with hydrogen-bonding, dispersion, and mixed interactions at a fraction of MP2/CBS computational cost. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {In designing organic materials for electronics applications, particularly for organic photovoltaics (OPV), the ionization potential (IP) of the donor and the electron affinity (EA) of the acceptor play key roles. This makes OPV design an appealing application for computational chemistry since IPs and EAs are readily calculable from most electronic structure methods. Unfortunately reliable, high-accuracy wave function methods, such as coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] in the complete basis set (CBS) limit are too expensive for routine applications to this problem for any but the smallest of systems. One solution is to calibrate approximate, less computationally expensive methods against a database of high-accuracy IP/EA values; however, to our knowledge, no such database exists for systems related to OPV design. The present work is the first of a multipart study whose overarching goal is to determine which computational methods can be used to reliably compute IPs and EAs of electron acceptors. This part introduces a database of 24 known organic electron acceptors and provides high-accuracy vertical IP and EA values expected to be within ±0.03 eV of the true non-relativistic, vertical CCSD(T)/CBS limit. Convergence of IP and EA values toward the CBS limit is studied systematically for the Hartree-Fock, MP2 correlation, and beyond-MP2 coupled cluster contributions to the focal point estimates.},

abstract = {A new model, termed D4, for the efficient computation of molecular dipole-dipole dispersion coefficients is presented. As in the related, well established D3 scheme, these are obtained as a sum of atom-in-molecule dispersion coefficients over atom pairs. Both models make use of dynamic polarizabilities obtained from first-principles time-dependent density functional theory calculations for atoms in different chemical environments employing fractional atomic coordination numbers for interpolation. Different from the D3 model, the coefficients are obtained on-the-fly by numerical Casimir-Polder integration of the dynamic, atomic polarizabilities $\alpha$(i$\omega$). Most importantly, electronic density information is now incorporated via atomic partial charges computed at a semi-empirical quantum mechanical tight-binding level, which is used to scale the polarizabilities. Extended statistical measures show that errors for dispersion coefficients with the proposed D4 method are significantly lower than with D3 and other, ...},

However, the analytic continuation problem is ill defined and currently no analytic transformation for solving it is known. We present a general framework for building an artificial neural network (ANN) that solves this task with a supervised learning approach. Application of the ANN approach to quantum Monte Carlo calculations and simulated Green's function data demonstrates its high accuracy. By comparing with the commonly used maximum entropy approach, we show that our method can reach the same level of accuracy for low-noise input data, while performing significantly better when the noise strength increases. The computational cost of the proposed neural network approach is reduced by almost three orders of magnitude compared to the maximum entropy method.},

The pair-correction and static correlation energies are functionals of the natural orbitals and the occupancy transferred between near-degenerate orbital pairs, rather than the orbital occupancies themselves. The dynamic correlation energy is a functional of the statically correlated on-top two-electron density. The on-top density functional used in this study is the well-known Colle-Salvetti functional. Using the cc-pVTZ basis set, the functional effectively models the bond dissociation of H2, LiH, and N2 with equilibrium bond lengths and dissociation energies comparable to those provided by multireference second-order perturbation theory. The performance of the cumulant functional is less impressive for HF and F2, mainly due to an underestimation of the dynamic correlation energy by the Colle-Salvetti functional.},

It is shown that a careless choice of H 0 may lead to absurd transition energies between two states, at the first orders of the perturbation, even when the perturbation converges for both states. A barycentric defintion of H 0 is proposed, which ensures the cancellation of common diagrams in the calculated transition energies. A practical iterative procedure is defined which allows a progressive improvement of the unperturbed wavefunction (|/°; the CI matrix restricted to a subspace S of strongly interacting determinants is diagonalized. The desired eigenvector i|/° of this matrix is perturbed by the determinants which do not belong to S. The most important determinants in i|/' are added to S , etc. The energy thus obtained after the second-order correction is compared with the ordinary perturbation series where fy0 is a single determinant. For the ground state, this procedure includes, besides the whole second-order correction, the most important terms of the third and fourth orders. The question of orthogonality of excited states is discussed. This technique, hereafter called CIPSI, has been tested on the ground and several excited states of H2, Ne, and MgO, showing both a rapid convergence of the calculated transition energy and the importance of correlation effects on transition energy.},

We benchmark the performance of the perturbative G0W0+SOSEX scheme for a set of molecular systems, including the G2 test set from quantum chemistry as well as benzene and tetracyanoethylene. We find that G0W0+SOSEX improves over G0W0 for the energy levels of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. In addition, it can resolve some of the difficulties encountered by the GW method for relative energy positions as exemplified by benzene where the energy spacing between certain valence orbitals is severely underestimated.},

abstract = {Calculations using modern linear-scaling electron-correlation methods are often much faster than the necessary reference Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations. We report a newly implemented HF program that speeds up the most time-consuming step, namely, the evaluation of the exchange contributions to the Fock matrix. Using localized orbitals and their sparsity, local density fitting (LDF), and atomic orbital domains, we demonstrate that the calculation of the exchange matrix scales asymptotically linearly with molecular size. The remaining parts of the HF calculation scale cubically but become dominant only for very large molecular sizes or with many processing cores. The method is well parallelized, and the speedup scales well with up to about 100 CPU cores on multiple compute nodes. The effect of the local approximations on the accuracy of computed HF and local second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory energies is systematically investigated, and default values are established for the parameters that determine the domain sizes. Using these values, calculations for molecules with hundreds of atoms in combination with triple-Χ basis sets can be carried out in less than 1 h, with just a few compute nodes. The method can also be used to speed up density functional theory calculations with hybrid functionals that contain HF exchange.},

abstract = {Quantum-mechanical methods are used for understanding molecular interactions throughout the natural sciences. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are state-of-the-art trusted wavefunction methods that have been shown to yield accurate interaction energies for small organic molecules. These methods provide valuable reference information for widely-used semi-empirical and machine learning potentials, especially where experimental information is scarce. However, agreement for systems beyond small molecules is a crucial remaining milestone for cementing the benchmark accuracy of these methods. We show that CCSD(T) and DMC interaction energies are not consistent for a set of polarizable supramolecules. Whilst there is agreement for some of the complexes, in a few key systems disagreements of up to 8 kcal mol−1 remain. These findings thus indicate that more caution is required when aiming at reproducible non-covalent interactions between extended molecules.},

The test sets consist of 15 conformers of Rand $\beta$-D-allopyranose, 15 of 3,6-anhydro-4-O-methyl-D-galactitol, and four of $\beta$-D-glucopyranose. For each set, conformational energies varied by about 7 kcal/mol. Results obtained with the Hartree-Fock method, with pure density functional approximations (DFAs) like LSDA, PBEsol, PBE, and TPSS and with hybrid DFAs like B3PW91, B3LYP, PBEh, and M05-2X, were then compared to the reference and local MP2 relative energies. Basis sets included 6-31G*, 6-31G**, 6-31+G*, 6-31+G**, 6-311+G**, 6-311++G**, cc-pVTZ(-f), cc-pVTZ, and augcc-pVTZ(-f). The smallest basis set that gives good DFA relative energies is 6-31+G**, and more converged results can be obtained with 6-311+G**. The optimized geometries obtained from a smaller basis set, 6-31+G*, were useful for subsequent single point energy calculations with larger basis sets. The best agreement with MP2 was shown by M05-2X, but only when using a dense DFT grid. The popular B3LYP functional is not the best for saccharide conformational studies. The B3PW91 functional gives systematically better results, but other hybrid functionals like PBEh or TPSSh are even better. Overall, the nonempirical PBE GGA and TPSS meta-GGA functionals also performed better than B3LYP. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

We review various state-of-the-art methods, including Mukherjee's state-specific multireference coupled-cluster (Mk-MRCC) theory, multireference Brillouin-Wigner coupled-cluster (MR-BWCC) theory, the MRexpT method, and internally contracted multireference coupled-cluster (ic-MRCC) theory. Related methods such as extended single-reference schemes [e.g., the complete active space coupled-cluster (CASCC) theory] and canonical transformation (CT) theory are covered as well. The comparison is done on the basis of formal arguments, implementation issues, and numerical results. Although a final and generally accepted multireference CC theory is still lacking, it is emphasized that recent developments render the new MRCC schemes useful tools for solving chemical problems. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

These systems include Fermi liquids as well as several important non-Fermi-liquid phases: one-dimensional Luttinger liquids, systems with long-range interactions, and fermions coupled to a gauge field. We report results for the critical dimensions separating different 'universality classes' and discuss the behaviour of physical quantities such as the momentum distribution function, the single-particle propagator and low-energy response functions in each class. The renormalization group for Fermi systems will be reviewed and applied as a link between microscopic models and effective lowenergy theories. Particular attention is paid to conservation laws, which constrain any effective low-energy theory of interacting Fermi systems. In scattering processes with small momentum transfers the velocity of each scattering particle is (almost) conserved. This asymptotic conservation law leads to non-trivial cancellations of Feynman diagrams and other simplifications, making thus possible a non-perturbative treatment of forward scattering via Ward identities or bosonization techniques. {\textcopyright} 1998 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Phys. Phys. Chem. 2006, 8, 1985) are presented and compared with standard MP2 results. The MP2 complete basis set limits are estimated using basis set extrapolation and augmented quadruple-zeta and quintuple-zeta basis sets. Already with augmented double-zeta basis sets the MP2-F12 interaction energies are found to be closer to the complete basis set limits than standard MP2 calculations with augmented quintuple-zeta basis sets. Various possible approximations in the MP2-F12 method are systematically tested. Best results are obtained with localized orbitals and the diagonal MP2-F12/C(D) ansatz. Hybrid approximations, in which some contributions of the auxiliary basis set are neglected and which considerably reduce the computational cost, have a negligible effect on the interaction energies. Also the orbital-invariant fixed-amplitude approximation of Ten-no leads to only slightly less accurate results. Preliminary results for the neon and benzene dimers, obtained with the recently proposed CCSD(T)-F12a approximation, indicate that the CCSD(T) basis set limits can also be very closely approached using augmented triple-zeta basis sets.},

abstract = {A self-consistent Kohn-Sham method based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem, employing the frequency-dependent exact exchange kernel fx is presented. The resulting SC-exact-exchange-only (EXX)-ACFD method leads to even more accurate correlation potentials than those obtained within the direct random phase approximation (dRPA). In contrast to dRPA methods, not only the Coulomb kernel but also the exact exchange kernel fx is taken into account in the EXX-ACFD correlation which results in a method that, unlike dRPA methods, is free of self-correlations, i.e., a method that treats exactly all one-electron systems, like, e.g., the hydrogen atom. The self-consistent evaluation of EXX-ACFD total energies improves the accuracy compared to EXX-ACFD total energies evaluated non-self-consistently with EXX or dRPA orbitals and eigenvalues. Reaction energies of a set of small molecules, for which highly accurate experimental reference data are available, are calculated and compared to quantum chemistry methods like M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order (MP2) or coupled cluster methods [CCSD, coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T))]. Moreover, we compare our methods to other ACFD variants like dRPA combined with perturbative corrections such as the second order screened exchange corrections or a renormalized singles correction. Similarly, the performance of our EXX-ACFD methods is investigated for the non-covalently bonded dimers of the S22 reference set and for potential energy curves of noble gas, water, and benzene dimers. The computational effort of the SC-EXX-ACFD method exhibits the same scaling of N5 with respect to the system size N as the non-self-consistent evaluation of only the EXX-ACFD correlation energy; however, the prefactor increases significantly. Reaction energies from the SC-EXX-ACFD method deviate quite little from EXX-ACFD energies obtained non-self-consistently with dRPA orbitals and eigenvalues, and the deviation reduces even further if the Coulomb kernel is scaled by a factor of 0.75 in the dRPA to reduce self-correlations in the dRPA correlation potential. For larger systems, such a non-self-consistent EXX-ACFD method is a competitive alternative to high-level wave-function-based methods, yielding higher accuracy than MP2 and CCSD methods while exhibiting a better scaling of the computational effort than CCSD or CCSD(T) methods. Moreover, EXX-ACFD methods were shown to be applicable in situation characterized by static correlation.},

abstract = {The hybrid meta density functionals M05-2X and M06-2X have been shown to provide broad accuracy for main group chemistry. In the present article we make the functional form more flexible and improve the self-interaction term in the correlation functional to improve its self-consistent-field convergence. We also explore the constraint of enforcing the exact forms of the exchange and correlation functionals through second order (SO) in the reduced density gradient. This yields two new functionals called M08-HX and M08-SO, with different exact constraints. The new functionals are optimized against 267 diverse main-group energetic data consisting of atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, proton affinities, dissociation energies, isomerization energies, barrier heights, noncovalent complexation energies, and atomic energies. Then the M08-HX, M08-SO, M05-2X, and M06-2X functionals and the popular B3LYP functional are tested against 250 data that were not part of the original training data for any of the functionals, in particular 164 main-group energetic data in 7 databases, 39 bond lengths, 38 vibrational frequencies, and 9 multiplicity-changing electronic transition energies. These tests include a variety of new challenges for complex systems, including large-molecule atomization energies, organic isomerization energies, interaction energies in uracil trimers, and bond distances in crowded molecules (in particular, cyclophanes). The M08-HX functional performs slightly better than M08-SO and M06-2X on average, significantly better than M05-2X, and much better than B3LYP for a combination of main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, noncovalent interactions, and electronic spectroscopy. More important than the slight improvement in accuracy afforded by M08-HX is the conformation that the optimization procedure works well for data outside the training set. Problems for which the accuracy is especially improved by the new M08-HX functional include large-molecule atomization energies, noncovalent interaction energies, conformational energies in aromatic peptides, barrier heights, multiplicity-changing excitation energies, and bond lengths in crowded molecules. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

Overall, the nonlocal van der Waals approach combined with last-generation density functionals is confirmed as an accurate and affordable computational tool for the modeling of weakly bonded molecular systems.},

The performance of a variety of ab initio and DFT methods (with and without empirical dispersion corrections) was assessed in detail. Consideration of all pairwise conformer energies provides a performance gauge for both H-bonds and van der Waals interactions, aside from internal strain of angles and bonds. In the post-HF realm, it was found that SCS(MI)CCSD-F12/cc-pVDZ-F12 can be a cost-effective alternative to CCSD(T)/CBS, almost without any loss in accuracy. In the DFT arena, the double-hybrid DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ surpasses the accuracy of all other methods (except for SCS(MI)CCSD, but at a small fraction of its cost). Several hybrid functionals provide an acceptable accuracy with the def2-QZVP basis set, especially BMK, M06, LC-$\omega$PBE-D3, and TPSS0-D3. With the more modest 6-311+G(d,p) basis set, the H-bonds are far from basis set completeness and, due to error compensation, the inclusion of a dispersion correction is generally counterproductive. Some functionals that represent "Pauling points" at this level are LC-$\omega$PBE, TPSS0, B1B95, BMK, TPSSh, PBE0, TPSS, and $\omega$B97X. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The RI-CDD-MP2 method shows an asymptotic cubic scaling behavior with system size and a small prefactor that results in an early crossover to conventional methods for both small and large basis sets. We also explore the use of local fitting approximations which allow to further reduce the scaling behavior for very large systems. The reliability of our method is demonstrated on test sets for interaction and reaction energies of medium sized systems and on a diverse selection from our own benchmark set for total energies of larger systems. Timings on DNA systems show that fast calculations for systems with more than 500 atoms are feasible using a single processor core. Parallelization extends the range of accessible system sizes on one computing node with multiple cores to more than 1000 atoms in a double-zeta basis and more than 500 atoms in a triple-zeta basis.},

abstract = {A new O ( N ) method for the iterative treatment of connected triple substitutions in the framework of local coupled cluster theory is introduced here, which is the local equivalent of the canonical CCSDT-1b method. The effect of the triple substitutions is treated in a self-consistent manner in each coupled cluster iteration. As for the local (T) method presented earlier in this series the computational cost of the method scales asymptotically linear with molecular size. The additional computational burden due to the involvement of triples in each coupled cluster iteration hence is not nearly as dramatic as for the parental canonical method, where it implies an increase in the computational complexity of the coupled cluster iteration from O ( N 6 ) to O ( N 7 ). The method has certain advantages in comparison to the perturbative a posteriori treatment of connected triples (T) for cases where static correlation effects start to play a role. It is demonstrated that molecules with about 100 atoms and 1000 basis functions can be treated with the local CCSDT-1b method, i.e., at a level beyond local CCSD(T). The new local coupled cluster methods introduced here and in previous papers of this series are applied in a study on the energetics of the Bergman auto-cyclization and retro-Bergman ring opening of an azaenediyne derivate, which was recently proposed as a promising candidate for anti-cancer drug development.},

While rather large deviations for the individual contributions of configurations to the electron correlation energy are found for MP wavefunctions, they profit from an advantageous and robust error cancellation: The absolute contribution to the correlation energy is generally underestimated for the critical excitations with small energy denominators and all other doubly excited configurations where the two excited electrons are coupled to a singlet. This is balanced by an overestimation of the contribution of triplet-coupled double excitations to the correlation energy. The even better performance of spin-component-scaled-MP2 theory is explained by a similar error compensation effect. The wavefunction analysis for the lowest singlet states of H2O, CH2, CO, and Cu+ shows the predicted trends for MP methods, rapid but biased convergence of CC theory as well as the substantial potential of linearized CC, or retaining the excitation-degree (RE)-PT.},

abstract = {We derive and assess two new classes of regularizers that cope with offending denominators in the single-reference second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). In particular, we discuss the use of two types of orbital energy dependent regularizers, $\kappa$ and $\sigma$, in conjunction with orbital-optimized MP2 (OOMP2). The resulting fifth-order-scaling methods, $\kappa$-OOMP2 and $\sigma$-OOMP2, have been examined for bond-breaking, thermochemistry, nonbonded interactions, and biradical problems. Both methods with strong enough regularization restore restricted to unrestricted instability (i.e., Coulson-Fischer points) that unregularized OOMP2 lacks when breaking bonds in H2, C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2. The training of the $\kappa$ and $\sigma$ regularization parameters was performed with the W4-11 set. We further developed scaled correlation energy variants, $\kappa$-S-OOMP2 and $\sigma$-S-OOMP2, by training on the TAE140 subset of the W4-11 set. Those new OOMP2 methods were tested on the RSE43 set and the TA13 set where unmodified OOMP2 itself performs very well. The modifications we made were found insignificant in these data sets. Furthermore, we tested the new OOMP2 methods on singlet biradicaloids using Yamaguchi's approximate spin-projection. Unlike the unregularized OOMP2, which fails to converge these systems due to the singularity, we show that regularized OOMP2 methods successfully capture strong biradicaloid characters. While further assessment on larger data sets is desirable, $\kappa$-OOMP2 with $\kappa$ = 1.45 Eh-1 appears to combine favorable recovery of Coulson-Fischer points with good numerical performance.},

abstract = {By employing high-level coupled cluster CCSD(T)-F12 calculations as reference, we herein systematically assessed the performance of 16 popular density functional theory (DFT) approximations for typical rhenium-catalyzed reactions. The reactions under study cover those catalyzed by low-valent rhenium(I)/(III) carbonyl complexes as well as high-valent organorhenium(VII) bisperoxo complex. Without DFT dispersion correction, the four best-performing functionals for the barrier heights are B2GP-PLYP, TPSSh, B3LYP, and PBE0 with the mean unsigned deviations (MUDs) under 1.6 kcal/mol. Among these four functionals, B2GP-PLYP generates more accurate barrier heights, while B3LYP and TPSSh behave more reliably in the barrier trend description for these Re-catalyzed reactions. In general, herein the hybrid functionals are better choices than pure GGA or pure meta-GGA functionals. DFT empirical dispersion corrections were found to have beneficial effects on MUDs only for four tested functionals of BMK, CAM-B3LYP, LC-$\omega$PBE, and $\omega$B97X. Often associated with very large errors up to about 15 kcal/mol in barrier height for many tested functionals, the reaction catalyzed by high-valent rhenium(VII) bisperoxo is apparently different from the ones catalyzed by low-valent rhenium(I)/(III) carbonyl complexes. For reactions catalyzed by Re(I)/(III) carbonyl complexes, $\omega$B97XD with dispersion correction performs excellently (MUD = 0.63 kcal/mol) and hence is highly recommended for these Re(I)/Re(III)-mediated reactions. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

This is however impossible in general, for it involves the functional derivative of {\$}\backslashSigma{\$} with respect to the Green's function. Here, we analyze the structure of this derivative, splitting it into four contributions and outlining the type of quasiparticle interactions that each of them generate. Moreover we show how, in the implementation of self-consistency, the action of these contributions can be classified into two: a quantitative renormalization of previously included interaction terms, and the inclusion of qualitatively novel interaction terms through successive functional derivatives of {\$}\backslashGamma{\$} itself, neglected until now. Implementing this latter type of self-consistency can extend the validity of Hedin's equations towards the high interaction limit, as we show in the example of the Hubbard dimer. Our analysis also provides a unifying perspective on the perturbation theory landscape, showing how the T-matrix approach is completely contained in Hedin's formalism.},

abstract = {Fluorescence, the absorption and re-emission of photons with longer wavelengths, is one of those amazing phenomena of Nature. Its discovery and utilization had, and still has, a major impact on biological and biomedical research, since it enables researchers not just to visualize normal physiological processes with high temporal and spatial resolution, to detect multiple signals concomitantly, to track single molecules in vivo, to replace radioactive assays when possible, but also to shed light on many pathobiological processes underpinning disease states, which would otherwise not be possible. Compounds that exhibit fluorescence are commonly called fluorochromes or fluorophores and one of these fluorescent molecules in particular has significantly enabled life science research to gain new insights in virtually all its sub-disciplines: Green Fluorescent Protein. Because fluorescent proteins are synthesized in vivo, integration of fluorescent detection methods into the biological system via genetic techniques now became feasible. Currently fluorescent proteins are available that virtually span the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Concomitantly, fluorescence imaging techniques were developed, and often progress in one field fueled innovation in the other. Impressively, the properties of fluorescence were utilized to develop new assays and imaging modalities, ranging from energy transfer to image molecular interactions to imaging beyond the diffraction limit with super-resolution microscopy. Here, an overview is provided of recent developments in both fluorescence imaging and fluorochrome engineering, which together constitute the "fluorescence toolbox" in life science research. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the authors.},

@article{Riplinger2013,
abstract = {In this work, the extension of the previously developed domain based local pair-natural orbital (DLPNO) based singles- and doubles coupled cluster (DLPNO-CCSD) method to perturbatively include connected triple excitations is reported. The development is based on the concept of triples-natural orbitals that span the joint space of the three pair natural orbital (PNO) spaces of the three electron pairs that are involved in the calculation of a given triple-excitation contribution. The truncation error is very smooth and can be significantly reduced through extrapolation to the zero threshold. However, the extrapolation procedure does not improve relative energies. The overall computational effort of the method is asymptotically linear with the system size O(N). Actual linear scaling has been confirmed in test calculations on alkane chains. The accuracy of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) approximation relative to semicanonical CCSD(T0) is comparable to the previously developed DLPNO-CCSD method relative to canonical CCSD. Relative energies are predicted with an average error of approximately 0.5 kcal∕mol for a challenging test set of medium sized organic molecules. The triples correction typically adds 30{\%}-50{\%} to the overall computation time. Thus, very large systems can be treated on the basis of the current implementation. In addition to the linear C150H302 (452 atoms, {\textgreater}8800 basis functions) we demonstrate the first CCSD(T) level calculation on an entire protein, Crambin with 644 atoms, and more than 6400 basis functions.},

An expression is rather provided where this quantity is expressed in terms of the X and Y amplitudes of the particle-hole phonon operators. A set of RPA-like equations depending only on the one-body density matrix is then constructed by means of the method of linearized equations of motion and solved via an iterative procedure.

Apparently for this reason, local spin density and generalized gradient approximations are more accurate for exchange and correlation together than for either alone. A study is made of the ability of these density functionals, and also the unmodified second‐order gradient expansion, to describe various short‐range effects in atoms: the correlation contribution to the interacting kinetic energy, the antiparallel‐spin correlation energy, and the correction to the random phase approximation. Generalized gradient approximations, constructed with no adjustable parameter from the electron gas of slowly varying density, are found to give results of useful accuracy for real atoms. Prospects are discussed for use of the new functionals to improve the accuracy of electronic‐structure calculations. {\textcopyright} 1993 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

@article{Korona2003,
abstract = {The Equation-of-Motion coupled cluster method restricted to single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD) and singlet excited states is formulated in a basis of nonorthogonal local orbitals. In the calculation of excited states only electron promotions from localized molecular orbitals into subspaces(excitation domains) of the local basis are allowed, which strongly reduces the number of EOM-CCSD amplitudes to be optimized. Furthermore, double excitations are neglected unless the excitation domains of the corresponding localized occupied orbitals are close to each other. Unlike in the local methods for the ground state, the excitation domains cannot be simply restricted to the atomic orbitals that are spatially close to the localized occupied orbitals. In the present paper the choice of the excitation domains is based on the analysis of wave functions computed by more approximate (and cheaper) methods like, e.g., configuration-interaction singles. The effect of various local approximations is investigated in detail, and it is found that a balanced description of the local configuration spaces describing the ground and excited states is essential to obtain accurate results. Using a single set of parameters for a given basis set, test calculations with the local EOM-CCSD method were performed for 14 molecules and 49 electronically excited states. The excitation energies computed by the local EOM-CCSD method reproduce the conventional EOM-CCSD excitation energies with an average error of 0.06 eV.},

In recent years, the molecular results obtained by several groups have shown that this approach is in general more accurate than the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, and is often competitive in accuracy with computationally more demanding conventional ab initio approaches. In this paper, our implementation of the relevant equations in the Amsterdam Density Functional program is described. We will focus on certain aspects of the implementation which are necessary for an efficient evaluation of the desired properties, enabling the treatment of large molecules. Such an efficient implementation is obtained by: using the full symmetry of the molecule, using a set of auxiliary functions for fitting the (zeroth- and first-order) electron density, using a highly vectorized and parallelized code, using linear scaling techniques, and, most importantly, by solving the response equations iteratively.},

The selected representative Mo/W-mediated reactions cover a wide range from enzymatic reactions to organometallic reactions, which include Mo-catalyzed aldehyde oxidation (aldehyde oxidoreductase), Mo-catalyzed dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reduction (DMSO reductase), W-catalyzed acetylene hydration (acetylene hydratase), Mo/W-mediated olefin metathesis, Mo/W-mediated olefin epoxidation, W-mediated alkyne metathesis, and W-mediated C-H bond activation. Covering both Mo- and W-mediated reactions, four DFs of B2GP-PLYP, M06, B2-PLYP, and B3LYP are uniformly recommended with and without DFT empirical dispersion correction. Among these four DFs, B3LYP is notably improved in performance by DFT empirical dispersion correction. In addition to the absolute value of calculation error, if the trend of DFT results is also a consideration, B2GP-PLYP, B2-PLYP, and M06 keep better performance than other functionals tested and constitute our final recommendation of DFs for both Mo- and W-mediated reactions.},

We identify the two-particle reducible vertex as the core function that is essential for the construction of the other vertex functions. This observation stimulates us to consider a two-level parameter reduction for this function to simplify the solution of the parquet equations. The resulting functions, which depend on fewer arguments, are coined "kernel functions." With the use of the kernel functions, the open boundary of various vertex functions in Matsubara-frequency space can be faithfully satisfied. We justify our implementation by accurately reproducing the dynamical mean-field theory results from momentum-independent parquet calculations. The high-frequency asymptotics of the single-particle self-energy and the two-particle vertex are correctly reproduced, which turns out to be essential for the self-consistent determination of the parquet solutions. The current implementation is also feasible for the dynamical vertex approximation.},

We show that, while DFT overestimates the bandwidth of most of the materials, the (Formula presented.) quasiparticle renormalization corrects the bandwidths in the right direction, but a full self-consistent calculation is needed to consistently achieve good agreement with photoemission data.

It describes the fact that, for fixed chemical potential, local electronic properties, such as the density n(r), depend significantly on the effective external potential only at nearby points. Changes of that potential, no matter how large, beyond a distance R have limited effects on local electronic properties, which rapidly tend to zero as a function of R. In the present paper, the concept is first sharpened for representative models of uncharged fermions moving in external potentials, and then the effects of electron-electron interactions and of perturbing external charges are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The field operators are considered as having two components (creation and annihilation), and G$\nu$ thus has (2)2$\nu$ components. The renormalization is carried out for superfluid Bose systems for which it is necessary to consider the expectation values of 2$\nu$ = 1. 2, 3, 4 operators. Superfluid Fermi systems and normal systems appear as particular cases, described by expectation values of 2$\nu$ = 2, 4 operators. This problem, dealt with by algebraic methods in part I, is attacked here by diagrammatic methods. These methods are more dependent on convergence properties but the resulting functionals are obtained explicitly as power series of the G $\nu$'s, the general term being represented by a class of diagrams characterized by their topological structure. In the final result, the entropy is exhibited as an explicit functional of the distribution functions G $\nu$, (2$\nu$ = 1, 2, 3, 4 ), or more precisely, of functions directly related to them. This functional no longer involves the potentials (nor the equilibrium parameters). It is stationary under independent variations of the G$\nu$'s subject to the constraints of constant energy and particle number. The four equations of stationarity exhibit each function $\upsilon$$\nu$ as a functional of the G$\nu$'s, self-consistently defining these distribution functions.},

The working equations are formulated in terms of the usual intermediates of MP2 when employing the resolution-of-the-identity approximation (RI) for two-electron integrals. Those intermediates are obtained by substituting the occupied and virtual quaternion pseudo-density matrices of our previously proposed two-component atomic orbital-based MP2 (J. Chem. Phys. 145, 014107 (2016)) by the corresponding pivoted quaternion Cholesky factors. While working within the Kramers-restricted formalism, we obtain a formal spin-orbit overhead of 16 and 28 for the Coulomb and exchange contribution to the 2C MP2 correlation energy, respectively, compared to a non-relativistic (NR) spin-free CDD-MP2 implementation. This compact quaternion formulation could also be easily explored in any other algorithm to compute the 2C MP2 energy. The quaternion Cholesky factors become sparse for large molecules and, with a block-wise screening, block sparse-matrix multiplication algorithm, we observed an effective quadratic scaling of the total wall time for heavy-element containing linear molecules with increasing system size. The total run time for both 1C and 2C calculations was dominated by the contraction to the exchange energy. We have also investigated a bulky Te-containing supramolecular complex. For such bulky, three-dimensionally extended molecules the present screening scheme has a much larger prefactor and is less effective.},

The parquet formalism is a self-consistent theory at both the single- and two-particle levels, and can thus describe individual fermions as well as their collective behavior on equal footing. This is essential for the understanding of various emergent phases and their transitions in many-body systems, in particular for cases in which a single-particle description fails. Our implementation of victory is in modern Fortran and it fully respects the structure of various vertex functions in both momentum and Matsubara frequency space. We found the latter to be crucial for the convergence of the parquet equations, as well as for the correct determination of various physical observables. In this release, we thoroughly explain the program structure and the controlled approximations to efficiently solve the parquet equations, i.e. the two-level kernel approximation and the high-frequency regulation. Program summary: Program Title: Victory Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/ym5kscj9sz.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 90 Nature of problem: The parquet equations require the knowledge of the fully irreducible vertex from which all one- and two-particle vertex and Green's functions are calculated. The underlying two-particle vertex functions are large memory objects that depend on three momenta with periodic boundary conditions and three frequencies with open ones. The coupled diagrams of the parquet equations extend the frequency dependence of the reducible vertex functions to a larger frequency space where, a priori, no information is available. Solution method: The reducible vertex functions are found to possess the simplest structure among all two-particle vertex functions and can be approximated by functions with a reduced number of arguments, i.e. the kernel functions. The open boundary issue of the vertex functions in Matsubara-frequency space is then solved as follows: we solve the parquet equations with the reducible vertex functions whenever it is possible, otherwise we supplement these by the kernel functions.},

abstract = {We present a systematic study of the quasiparticle band structures of transition-metal halides CuCl, CuBr, AgCl, and AgBr. We show that GW calculations for cuprous halides are significantly more challenging computationally than ZnO, a much-discussed extreme case. The local-density approximation (LDA) within density functional theory severely underestimates the band gaps of CuCl and CuBr due to the inaccurate treatment of the semicore d electrons. As a result, many-body perturbation calculations within the G0W0 approach fail to give accurate quasiparticle properties starting from the LDA mean-field solution. The LDA+U method (with the screened Coulomb and exchange parameters calculated using a constrained random-phase-approximation approach), on the other hand, provides a much better starting point for subsequent G0W0 calculations. When properly converged, the G0W0/LDA+U approach is able to reproduce the experimental minimum band gaps of all four compounds to within 0.1 eV. These results, however, can be achieved only by applying extremely high cutoff parameters, which would be very difficult without using our recently developed accelerated GW approach. Our work demonstrates the applicability and accuracy of the G0W0/LDA+U method in predicting the quasiparticle band structure of these materials and other systems involving localized semicore states.},

abstract = {This article presents a perspective on Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) for electronic structure calculations in chemical physics. This theory is in widespread use for applications to both molecules and solids. We pay special attention to several aspects where there are both concerns and progress toward solutions. These include: 1. The treatment of open-shell and inherently multiconfigurational systems (the latter are often called multireference systems and are variously classified as having strong correlation, near-degeneracy correlation, or high static correlation; KS-DFT must treat these systems with broken-symmetry determinants). 2. The treatment of noncovalent interactions. 3. The choice between developing new functionals by parametrization, by theoretical constraints, or by a combination. 4. The ingredients of the exchange-correlation functionals used by KS-DFT, including spin densities, the magnitudes of their gradients, spin-specific kinetic energy densities, nonlocal exchange (Hartree-Fock exchange), nonlocal correlation, and subshell-dependent corrections (DFT+U). 5. The quest for a universal functional, where we summarize some of the success of the latest Minnesota functionals, namely MN15-L and MN15, which were obtained by optimization against diverse databases. 6. Time-dependent density functional theory, which is an extension of DFT to treat time-dependent problems and excited states. The review is a snapshot of a rapidly moving field, and - like Marcel Duchamp - we hope to convey progress in a stimulating way.},

abstract = {A method of calculation of excited states with spin-orbit couplings, which utilizes left and right eigenvectors of equation-of-motion coupled-cluster singles and doubles model has been formulated and implemented. The spin-orbit interactions are introduced by using the spin-orbit mean field approximation of the Briet-Pauli Hamiltonian. In order to evaluate all the necessary matrix elements, a scheme based on the diagrammatic representation of the second-quantized form of the spin-orbit interaction operator and the standard rules of second-quantized algebra is presented. We posit that this scheme is general and much simpler to use than the often used rules derived for the configuration state functions by using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. We show that the spin-orbit coupled states (i.e., target relativistic states) must satisfy specific conditions in order to classify them according to the double group symmetry. This interrelation between the structure of the target relativistic states and its double group symmetry is discussed in detail. An algorithm to classify the target states according to the irreducible representation of the double group symmetry is offered and implemented. Numerical tests for several atoms and molecules show good agreement of predicted and experimental spin-orbit splittings of the target excited states.},

In order to calculate photoabsorption spectra, one had to additionally solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for the two-particle (electron-hole) Green's function, which doubly induces evaluation errors. It has been recently reported that the GW+BSE method significantly underestimates the experimental photoabsorption energies (PAEs) of small molecules. In order to avoid these problems, we propose to apply the GW($\Gamma$) method not to the neutral ground state but to the cationic state to calculate PAEs without solving the BSE, which allows a rigorous one-to-one correspondence between the photoabsorption peak and the "extended" quasiparticle level. We applied the self-consistent linearized GW$\Gamma$ method including the vertex correction $\Gamma$ to our method, and found that this method gives the PAEs of B, Na3, and Li3 to within 0.1eV accuracy.},

abstract = {Many technically relevant chemical processes in the condensed phase involve as elementary reactive steps the formation of ions from neutral species or, as the opposite, recombination of ions. Such reactions that generate or annihilate charge defy the standard gas phase quantum chemical treatment, and also continuum solvation models are only partially able to account for the right amount of stabilization in solution. In this work, for such types of reaction, a solvation treatment involving the COSMO-RS method is assessed, which leads to improved results, i.e., errors of only around 10 kJ/mol for both protic and aprotic solvents. The examples discussed here comprise protolysis reactions and organo halide heterolysis, for both of which a comparison with reliable experimental data is possible. It is observed that for protolysis, the quality of results does not strongly depend on the quantum chemical method used for energy calculation. In contrast, in the case of heterolytic carbon-chlorine bond cleavage, clearly better results are obtained for higher correlated (coupled cluster) methods or the density functional M06-2X, which is well known for its accuracy if applied to organic chemistry. This hints at least that the right answer is obtained for the right reason and not due to a compensation of errors from gas phase thermodynamics with those from the solvation treatment. Problems encountered with certain critical solvents or upon decomposing Gibbs free energies into heats or entropies of reaction are found to relate mostly to the parameterization of the H-bonding term within COSMO-RS. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The efficiency of solar cells may be increased by utilizing photons with energies below the band gap of the absorber. This may be enabled by upconversion of low energy photons into high energy photons via triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) in organic chromophores. The quantum yield of TTA is often low due to competing processes. The singlet pathway, where a high energy photon is emitted, is one of three possible outcomes of an encounter between two triplet excitons. The quintet pathway is often too high in energy to be accessible, leaving the triplet pathway as the main competing process. Using many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we calculate the energy release in both the singlet and triplet pathways for 59 chromophores of different chemical families. We find that in most cases the triplet pathway is open and has a larger energy release than the singlet pathway. Thus, the energetics perspective explains why there are so few TTA emitters and why the quantum yield of TTA is typically low. That said, our results also indicate that the performance of emitters from known chemical families may be improved by chemical modifications, such as functionalization with side groups, and that new chemical families could be explored to discover more TTA emitters.},

In this review, we describe the underlying photophysical principles by which this energy is absorbed, as well as the mechanisms of electronic excitation energy transfer (EET). First, optical properties of the individual pigment chromophores present in light-harvesting antenna complexes are introduced, and then we examine the collective behavior of pigment-pigment and pigment-protein interactions. The description of energy transfer, in particular multichromophoric antenna structures, is shown to vary depending on the spatial and energetic landscape, which dictates the relative coupling strength between constituent pigment molecules. In the latter half of the article, we focus on the lightharvesting complexes of purple bacteria as a model to illustrate the present understanding of the synergetic effects leading to EET optimization of light-harvesting antenna systems while exploring the structure and function of the integral chromophores.

abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

abstract = {First-order nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements (NACMEs) are key for phenomena such as nonradiative transitions and excited-state decay, yet a consistent and practical first principles treatment has been elusive for molecules with more than a few heavy atoms. Here we present theory, implementation using Gaussian basis sets, and benchmarks of first-order NACMEs between ground and excited states in the framework of time-dependent hybrid density functional theory (TDDFT). A time-dependent response approach to NACMEs which avoids explicit computation of excited-state wave functions is outlined. In contrast to previous approaches, the present treatment produces exact analytical derivative couplings between time-dependent Kohn-Sham (TDKS) determinants in a finite atom-centered basis set. As in analytical gradient theory, derivative molecular orbital coefficients can be eliminated, making the computational cost independent of the number of nuclear degrees of freedom. Our expression reduces to the exact Chernyak-Mukamel formula for first-order NACMEs in the complete basis-set limit, but greatly improves basis-set convergence in finite atom-centered basis sets due to additional Pulay type terms. The Chernyak-Mukamel formula is shown to be equivalent to the Hellmann-Feynman contribution in analytical gradient theory. Our formalism may be implemented in TDDFT analytical excited-state gradient codes with minor modifications. Tests for systems with up to 147 atoms show that evaluation of first-order NACMEs causes total computation times to increase by an insignificant 10{\%} on average. The resolution-of-the-identity approximation for the Coulomb energy (RI-J) reduces the computational cost by an order of magnitude for nonhybrid functionals, while errors are insignificant with standard auxiliary basis sets. We compare the computed NACMEs to full configuration interaction (FCI) in benchmark results for diatomic molecules; hybrid TDDFT and FCI are found to be in agreement for regions of the potential energy curve where the Kohn-Sham ground-state reference is stable and the character of the excitation is properly captured by the present functionals. With these developments, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations of molecular systems in the 100 atoms regime are within reach. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In describing transport phenomena, it is vital to build the conservation laws of number, energy, momentum, and angular momentum into the structure of the approximation used to determine the thermodynamic many-particle Green's functions. A method for generating conserving approximations has been developed. This method is based on a consideration, at finite temperature, of the equations of motion obeyed by the one-particle propagator G, defined in the presence of a nonlocal external scalar field U. Approximations for G(U) are obtained by replacing the G2(U) which appears in these equations by various functionals of G(U). If the approximation for G2(U) satisfies certain simple symmetry conditions, then the G(U) thus defined obeys all the conservation laws. Furthermore, the two-particle correlation function, generated as ($\delta$G$\delta$U)U=0±L, in terms of which all linear transport can be described, will obey all the conservation laws as well as several essential sum rules, such as the longitudinal f-sum rule. Several examples of conserving approximations are described. The Hartree approximation, G2(U)=G(U)G(U), generates the random-phase approximation for L. The Hartree-Fock approximation for G(U) leads to a natural generalization of the random-phase approximation in which hole-particle ladder diagrams are summed. Another conserving approximation for G(U) is obtained by expanding the self-energy to first order in the many-particle scattering matrix T(U). This T is obtained by summing ladder diagrams in which the sides of the ladder are composed of G(U)'s. The resulting L equation, which involves coefficients proportional to |T|2, is analogous to the linearized version of the usual Boltzmann equation. Finally, in order to obtain a description of collisions in a plasma, the self-energy is expanded to first order in a dynamically shielded potential, Vs(U). This potential is obtained by summing bubbles composed of two G(U)'s. The resulting L equation is similar in structure to a Boltzmann equation in which the collision cross section is proportional to |Vs|2. {\textcopyright} 1961 The American Physical Society.},

Because the functional also yields more accurate electronic energies for molecules in their equilibrium geometry than standard correlation functionals, it combines accuracy at equilibrium bond distances and in dissociation processes with a correct description of spin, something all commonly employed correlation functionals fail to do.

abstract = {ConspectusGuanine (G) radicals are precursors to DNA oxidative damage, correlated with carcinogenesis and aging. During the past few years, we demonstrated clearly an intriguing effect: G radicals can be generated upon direct absorption of UV radiation with energy significantly lower than the G ionization potential. Using nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we studied the primary species, ejected electrons and guanine radicals, which result from photoionization of various DNA systems in aqueous solution.The DNA propensity to undergo electron detachment at low photon energies greatly depends on its secondary structure. Undetected for monomers or unstacked oligomers, this propensity may be 1 order of magnitude higher for G-quadruplexes than for duplexes. The experimental results suggest nonvertical processes, associated with the relaxation of electronic excited states. Theoretical studies are required to validate the mechanism and determine the factors that come into play. Such a mechanism, which may be operative over a broad excitation wavelength range, explains the occurrence of oxidative damage observed upon UVB and UVA irradiation.Quantification of G radical populations and their time evolution questions some widespread views. It appears that G radicals may be generated with the same probability as pyrimidine dimers, which are considered to be the major lesions induced upon absorption of low-energy UV radiation by DNA. As most radical cations undergo deprotonation, the vast majority of the final reaction products is expected to stem from long-lived deprotonated radicals. Consequently, when G radical cations are involved, the widely used oxidation marker 8-oxodG is not representative of the oxidative damage.Beyond the biological consequences, photogeneration of electron holes in G-quadruplexes may inspire applications in nanoelectronics; although four-stranded structures are currently studied as molecular wires, their behavior as photoconductors has not been explored so far.In the present Account, after highlighting some key experimental issues, we first describe the photoionization process, and then, we focus on radicals. We use as show-cases new results obtained for genomic DNA and Oxytricha G-quadruplexes. Generation and reaction dynamics of G radicals in these systems provide a representative picture of the phenomena reported previously for duplexes and G-quadruplexes, respectively.},

Attenuated second order Moller-Plesset theory (MP2) captures intermolecular binding energies at equilibrium geometries with high fidelity with respect to reference methods, yet must fail to reproduce dispersion energies at stretched geometries due to the removal of fully long-range dispersion. For this problem to be ameliorated, long-range correction using the VV10 van der Waals density functional is added to attenuated MP2, capturing short-range correlation with attenuated MP2 and long-range dispersion with VV10. Attenuated MP2 with long-range VV10 dispersion in the aug-cc-pVTZ (aTZ) basis set, MP2-V(terfc, aTZ), is parametrized for noncovalent interactions using the S66 database and tested on a variety of noncovalent databases, describing potential energy surfaces and equilibrium binding energies equally well. Further, a spin-component scaled (SCS) version, SCS-MP2-V(2terfc, aTZ), is produced using the W4-11 database as a supplemental thermochemistry training set, and the resulting method reproduces the quality of MP2-V(terfc, aTZ) for noncovalent interactions and exceeds the performance of SCS-MP2/aTZ for thermochemistry.

abstract = {We derive a finite-basis-set correction for quasiparticle (QP) energies in the GW approximation and many-body correlation energies in the random phase approximation. Since the correction requires only knowledge of the ground-state density distribution, it is straightforward to implement in any plane-wave code and significantly improves convergence at negligible computational cost. The expression also indicates that QP energies might converge to the wrong value using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method since the overlap densities of occupied orbitals and high-energy, plane-wave-like orbitals are inaccurately described. The error is shown to be related to the incompleteness of the partial waves inside the atomic spheres. It can be avoided by adopting norm-conserving partial waves. G0W0 and GW0 results based on such norm-conserving PAW potentials are presented for a large set of semiconductors and insulators. Accurate extrapolation procedures to the infinite-basis-set limit and infinite-k-point limit are discussed in detail. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

Notably, they have also been previously validated to be highly robust for main-group chemistry. Nevertheless, even these methods show substantially worse accuracies for transition metals than for main-group chemistry. For less accurate methods, there is not a good correlation between their accuracies for main-group and transition-metal chemistries. Thus, in the development of new DFT, it is important to assess the accuracies for both types of data. In this regard, we have formulated the TMC34 model for efficient assessment of the performance for transition metals, which complements our previously developed MG8 model for main-group chemistry.

First of all, we revisit the reference CCSD(T) ionization potentials for this popular benchmark set and establish a revised set of CCSD(T) results. Then, for all of these 100 molecules, we calculate the HOMO energy within second and third-order perturbation theory (PT2 and PT3), and, GW as post-Hartree-Fock methods. We found GW to be the most accurate of these three approximations for the ionization potential, by far. Going beyond GW by adding more diagrams is a tedious and dangerous activity: We tried to complement GW with second-order exchange (SOX), with second-order screened exchange (SOSEX), with interacting electron-hole pairs ( W TDHF ), and with a GW density-matrix ( $\gamma$ GW ). Only the $\gamma$ GW result has a positive impact. Finally using an improved hybrid functional for the non-interacting Green's function, considering it as a cheap way to approximate self-consistency, the accuracy of the simplest GW approximation improves even more. We conclude that GW is a miracle: Its subtle balance makes GW both accurate and fast.},

The general properties of G(k, $\omega$) are discussed, in particular the static and high-frequency limits. It is shown that for small k, both G(k, 0) and G(k, ∞) vary as k2, with different coefficients, but both determined by the average kinetic and potential energies per particle. For large k, G(k, ∞) varies again as k2 and it is argued that the same holds true for G(k, 0), with both coefficients (though different) determined by the average kinetic energy per particle. General formulas for the plasma dispersion relation and damping, involving, respectively, the real and imaginary parts of G(k, $\omega$), are given. The term in the plasma frequency which is proportional to k2 is given directly in terms of the average kinetic and potential energies per particle, a result true at all temperatures. A calculation of the frequency dependence of G(k, $\omega$), starting from the exact equation of motion for the particle-hole operator and employing a decoupling approximation introduced previously by Toigo and Woodruff, is presented. Explicit results for G(k, $\omega$) are obtained for small k and all $\omega$.

The success of GW can be attributed to many factors: favorable scaling with respect to system size, a formal interpretation for charged excitation energies, the importance of dynamical screening in real systems, and its practical combination with other theories. In this review, we provide an overview of these formal and practical considerations. We expand, in detail, on the choices presented to the scientist performing GW calculations for the first time. We also give an introduction to the many-body theory behind GW, a review of modern applications like molecules and surfaces, and a perspective on methods which go beyond conventional GW calculations.

Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions, and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are, in particular, DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The best hybrids are $\omega$B97X-V, M052X-D3(0), and $\omega$B97X-D3, but we also recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the best conventional global hybrid. At the meta-generalised-gradient (meta-GGA) level, the SCAN-D3(BJ) method can be recommended. Other meta-GGAs are outperformed by the GGA functionals revPBE-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ), and OLYP-D3(BJ). We note that many popular methods, such as B3LYP, are not part of our recommendations. In fact, with our results we hope to inspire a change in the user community's perception of common DFT methods. We also encourage method developers to use GMTKN55 for cross-validation studies of new methodologies. },

This is especially the case for the polarizable formulation of these models, the recent advances in which we review here.

abstract = {A production level implementation of the closed-shell local quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster methods with single and double excitations (QCISD and CCSD) based on the concept of pair natural orbitals [local pair natural orbital LPNO-QCISD and LPNO-CCSD) is reported, evaluated, and discussed. This work is an extension of the earlier developed LPNO coupled-electron pair approximation (LNPO-CEPA) method [F. Neese et al., Chem. Phys. 130, 114108 (2009)] and makes extended use of the resolution of the identity (RI) or density fitting (DF) approximation. Two variants of each method are compared. The less accurate approximations (LPNO2-QCISD/LPNO2-CCSD) still recover 98.7{\%}-99.3{\%} of the correlation energy in the given basis and have modest disk space requirements. The more accurate variants (LPNO1-QCISD/LPNO1-CCSD) typically recover 99.75{\%}-99.95{\%} of the correlation energy in the given basis but require the Coulomb and exchange operators with up to two-external indices to be stored on disk. Both variants have comparable computational efficiency. The convergence of the results with respect to the natural orbital truncation parameter (T(CutPNO)) has been studied. Extended numerical tests have been performed on absolute and relative correlation energies as function of basis set size and T(CutPNO) as well as on reaction energies, isomerization energies, and weak intermolecular interactions. The results indicate that the errors of the LPNO methods compared to the canonical QCISD and CCSD methods are below 1 kcal/mol with our default thresholds. Finally, some calculations on larger molecules are reported (ranging from 40-86 atoms) and it is shown that for medium sized molecules the total wall clock time required to complete the LPNO-CCSD calculations is only two to four times that of the preceding self-consistent field (SCF). Thus these methods are highly suitable for large-scale computational chemistry applications. Since there are only three thresholds involved that have been given conservative default values, the methods can be confidentially used in a "black-box" fashion in the same way as their canonical counterparts.},

We benchmarked the accuracy of our algorithm as a function of a single parameter sensitive to the shape of the Green's function. Through numerous examples, we confirmed that our algorithm can be utilized in a systematically improvable, controlled, and black-box manner and highly accurate one- and two-body energies and one-particle density matrices can be obtained using only around 5{\%} of the original grid points. Additionally, we established that to improve accuracy by an order of magnitude, the number of grid points needs to be doubled, whereas for the Matsubara frequency grid, an order of magnitude more grid points must be used. This suggests that realistic calculations with large basis sets that were previously out of reach because they required enormous grid sizes may now become feasible.},

abstract = {Attenuated second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) within the finite aug-cc-pVTZ (aTZ) basis set is developed for inter- and intra-molecular non-bonded interactions. A single attenuation parameter is optimized on the S66 database of 66 intermolecular interactions, leading to a very large RMS error reduction by a factor of greater than 5 relative to standard MP2/aTZ. Attenuation introduces an error of opposite sign to basis set superposition error (BSSE) and overestimation of dispersion interactions in finite basis MP2. A variety of tests including the S22 set, conformer energies of peptides, alkanes, sugars, sulfate-water clusters, and the coronene dimer establish the transferability of the MP2(terfc, aTZ) model to other inter and intra-molecular interactions. Direct comparisons against attenuation in the smaller aug-cc-pVDZ basis shows that MP2(terfc, aTZ) often significantly outperforms MP2(terfc, aDZ), although at higher computational cost. MP2(terfc, aDZ) and MP2(terfc, aTZ) often out-perform MP2 at the complete basis set limit. Comparison of the two attenuated MP2 models against each other and against attenuation using non-augmented basis sets gives insight into the error cancellation responsible for their remarkable success. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Owner Societies.},

abstract = {The development of M{\o}ller–Plesset perturbation theory (MPPT) has seen four different periods in almost 80 years. In the first 40 years (period 1), MPPT was largely ignored because the focus of quantum chemists was on variational methods. After the development of many-body perturbation theory by theoretical physicists in the 1950s and 1960s, a second 20-year long period started, during which MPn methods up to order n = 6 were developed and computer-programed. In the late 1980s and in the 1990s (period 3), shortcomings of MPPT became obvious, especially the sometimes erratic or even divergent behavior of the MPn series. The physical usefulness of MPPT was questioned and it was suggested to abandon the theory. Since the 1990s (period 4), the focus of method development work has been almost exclusively on MP2. A wealth of techniques and approaches has been put forward to convert MP2 from a O(M5) computational problem into a low-order or linear-scaling task that can handle molecules with thousands of atoms. In addition, the accuracy of MP2 has been systematically improved by introducing spin scaling, dispersion corrections, orbital optimization, or explicit correlation. The coming years will see a continuously strong development in MPPT that will have an essential impact on other quantum chemical methods.},

abstract = {The major source of errror in most ab initio calculations of molecular energies is the truncation of the one-electron basis set. A complete basis set model chemistry is defined to include corrections for basis set truncation errors. This model uses double zeta plus polarization level atomic pair natural orbital basis sets to calculate molecular self-consistent-field (SCF) energies and correlation energies. The small corrections to give the complete basis set SCF energies are then estimated using the l-6 asymptotic convergence of the multicenter angular momentum expansion. The calculated correlation energies of the atoms He, Be, and Ne, and of the hydrides LiH, BH3, CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF, using the double zeta plus polarization basis sets vary from 83.0{\%} to 91.2{\%} of the experimental correlation energies. However, extrapolation of each of the pair energies and pair-coupling terms to the complete basis set values using the asymptotic convergence of pair natural orbital expansions retrieves from 99.5 ± 0.7{\%} to 101.1 ± 0.6{\%} of the experimental correlation energies for these atoms and molecules. With the exception of ammonia which gave 101.1{\%}, the calculated correlation energies agree with the experimental values to within the error limits of the experiments for all these atoms and molecules with more than four electrons. The total extrapolated energies (ESCF + E Correlation) are then in agreement with experiment to within ± 0.0014 hartree (root mean square deviation) and represent the most accurate total energy calculations yet reported for the molecules. The largest discrepancies with experiment occur for methane, where we obtain E Total = - 40.5112 hartree compared to EExpt = - 40.514 ± 0.002 hartree, and ammonia, where we obtain ETotal = - 56.5659 hartree compared to EExpt = - 56.563 ± 0.002 hartree. {\textcopyright} 1988 American Institute of Physics.},

Quasiparticle effects produce significant qualitative changes in the band structures of these materials when compared to density functional theory (DFT), especially at the $\Gamma$ point, where band inversion takes place. There, the widely used perturbative one-shot GW approach can produce unphysical band dispersions, as the quasiparticle wave functions are forced to be identical to the noninteracting single-particle states. We show that a treatment beyond the perturbative approach, which incorporates the off-diagonal GW matrix elements and thus enables many-body hybridization to be effective in the quasiparticle wave functions, is crucial in these cases to describe the characteristics of the band inversion around the $\Gamma$ point in an appropriate way. In addition, this beyond one-shot GW approach allows us to calculate the values of the Z2 topological invariants and compare them with those previously obtained within DFT. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

We find that a vertex derived from time-dependent density-functional theory can give accurate self-energies, provided, however, a proper decay at large momentum transfer (large (Formula presented)) is built into the vertex function. (The local-density approximation for the vertex fails badly.) Total energies are calculated from the Galitskii-Migdal formula, and it is shown that a proper large-(Formula presented) behavior results in a close consistency between the chemical potentials derived from these energies and those obtained directly from the self-energy. We show that this internal consistency depends critically on including the same vertex correction in both the self-energy and the screening function. In addition the total energies become almost as accurate as those from elaborate Monte Carlo calculations. This as well as previous works show that self-energy corrections are important for properly describing electron propagation at energies around and above the plasmon energy. For easy use in calculations of photoemission and x-ray extended fine structure spectra, we parametrize our calculated self-energies in terms of a simple analytical expression. {\textcopyright} 1997 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The short-range correlation energy of the random phase approximation (RPA) is too negative and is often corrected by local or nonlocal methods. These beyond-RPA corrections usually lead to a mixed performance for thermodynamics and dissociation properties. RPA+ is an additive correction based on density functional approximations that often gives realistic total energies for atoms or solids. RPA+ adds a moderate correction to the ionization energies/electron affinities of RPA but does not yield an improvement beyond RPA for atomization energies of molecules. This incompleteness results in severely underestimated atomization energies just like in RPA. Exchange-correlation kernels within the Dyson equation could simultaneously improve atomization, ionization energies, and electron affinities, but their implementation is computationally less feasible in localized basis set codes. In preceding work (Phys. Rev. A 100, 2019022515), two of the authors proposed a computationally efficient generalized RPA+ (gRPA+) that changes RPA+ only for spin-polarized systems by making gRPA+ exact for all one-electron densities. gRPA+ was found to yield a large improvement of ionization energies and electron affinities of light atoms over RPA, and a smaller improvement over RPA+. Within this work, we investigate to what extent this improvement transfers to atomization energies, ionization energies, and electron affinities of molecules, using a modified gRPA+ (mgRPA+) method that can be applied in codes with localized basis functions. We thereby aim to understand the applicability of beyond-RPA corrections based on density functional approximations.},

Our method eliminates the errors introduced by RI which are known to be problematic for absolute energies. In this way, independence of the error compensation assumption for relative energies is also achieved. The proposed method is based on the idea of starting with an oversized RI basis and projecting out all of its unphysical parts. The approach can be easily implemented into existing RI codes and results in an overhead of about 30{\%}, while effectively removing the RI error. In passing, this process alleviates the problem that for many frequently employed basis sets no optimized RI basis sets have been constructed. In this paper, the theory is presented and results are discussed exemplarily for the random phase approximation and M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory.},

Unlike previous localized perturbation theories, our formulation is strictly identical with canonical MP4 theory if no further approximations are made. In the local treatment, large savings can be achieved by two techniques: (1) neglecting or treating at a lower (second order) level pair correlation between distant pairs, and (2) restricting the correlation basis to the atomic orbitals in the spatial vicinity of the correlated pair. These techniques have been used in our previous local correlation treatment for variational CI, coupled electron pair (CEPA), and approximate coupled cluster (ACCD) wave functions. The MP4 method is more economical than these techniques because of the absence of iterative cycles. Implementation with single, double, and quadruple substitutions is discussed.},

A distinctive feature of VOTCA-XTP is the capability to couple the calculation of electronic excitations to a classical polarizable environment on an atomistic level in a coupled quantum- A nd molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) scheme, where a complex morphology can be imported from Molecular Dynamics simulations. The capabilities and limitations of the GW-BSE implementation are illustrated with two examples. First, we study the dependence of optically active electron-hole excitations in a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based oligomers on molecular-architecture modifications and the number of repeat units. Second, we use the GW-BSE/MM setup to investigate the effect of polarization on localized and intermolecular charge-transfer excited states in morphologies of low-donor content rubrene-fullerene mixtures. These showcases demonstrate that our implementation currently allows us to treat systems with up to 2500 basis functions on regular shared-memory workstations, providing accurate descriptions of quasiparticle and coupled electron-hole excited states of various characters on an equal footing.},

After testing the generality of the conclusions for the gallium atom, the procedure was used to generate correlation consistent basis sets for all of the atoms gallium through krypton. The correlation consistent basis sets for the third row main group atoms are as follows: cc-pVDZ: (14s11p6d)/[5s4p2d]; cc-PVTZ: (20s13p9d1f)/[6s5p3d1f]; cc-pVQZ: (21s16p12d2f1g)/[7s6p4d2f1g]; cc-pV5Z: (26s17p13d3f2g1h)/[8s7p5d3f2g1h]. Augmented sets were obtained by adding diffuse functions to the above sets (one for each angular momentum present in the set), with the exponents of the additional functions optimized in calculations on the atomic anions. Test calculations on the atoms as well as selected molecules with the new basis sets show good convergence to an apparent complete basis set limit. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We investigate the performance of contemporary semilocal and hybrid density functionals for bond energetics, structures, dipole moments, and harmonic frequencies of 3d transition-metal (TM) compounds by comparison with gas-phase experiments. Special attention is given to the nonempirical metageneralized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) of Tao, Perdew, Staroverov, and Scuseria (TPSS) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 146401 (2003)], which has been implemented in TURBOMOLE for the present work. Trends and error patterns for classes of homologous compounds are analyzed, including dimers, monohydrides, mononitrides, monoxides, monofluorides, polyatomic oxides and halogenides, carbonyls, and complexes with organic pi ligands such as benzene and cyclopentadienyl. Weakly bound systems such as Ca(2), Mn(2), and Zn(2) are discussed. We propose a reference set of reaction energies for benchmark purposes. Our all-electron results with quadruple zeta valence basis sets validate semilocal density-functional theory as the workhorse of computational TM chemistry. Typical errors in bond energies are substantially larger than in (organic) main group chemistry, however. The Becke-Perdew'86 [Phys. Rev. A 38, 3098 (1988); Phys. Rev. B 33, 8822 (1986)] GGA and the TPSS meta-GGA have the best price/performance ratio, while the TPSS hybrid functional achieves a slightly lower mean absolute error in bond energies. The popular Becke three-parameter hybrid B3LYP underbinds significantly and tends to overestimate bond distances; we give a possible explanation for this. We further show that hybrid mixing does not reduce the width of the error distribution on our reference set. The error of a functional for the s-d transfer energy of a TM atom does not predict its error for TM bond energies and bond lengths. For semilocal functionals, self-interaction error in one- and three-electron bonds appears to be a major source of error in TM reaction energies. Nevertheless, TPSS predicts the correct ground-state symmetry in the vast majority of cases and rarely fails qualitatively. This further confirms TPSS as a general purpose functional that works throughout the periodic table. We also give workstation timing comparisons for the 645-atom protein crambin.},

In the DC-CCSD method, the CCSD equations derived from subsystem orbitals are solved for each subsystem in order to obtain the total correlation energy by summing up subsystem contributions using energy density analysis. In this study, we extend the DC-CCSD method for treating noniterative perturbative triple excitations using CCSD T(1) and T(2) amplitudes, namely, CCSD(T). In the DC-CCSD(T) method, the so-called (T) corrections are also computed for each subsystem. Numerical assessments indicate that DC-CCSD(T) reproduces the CCSD(T) results with high accuracy and significantly less computational cost.

Our method is guided by two strategies: (i) to respect the locality of the underlying electronic interactions and (ii) to avoid the singularities of Greens functions by manipulating, instead, their spectral functions using fast Fourier transform methods. To take into account the locality of the electronic interactions, we use a local basis of atomic orbitals and, also, a local basis in the space of their products. We further compress the screened Coulomb interaction into a space of lower dimensions for speed and to reduce memory requirements. The improved scaling of our method with respect to most of the published methodologies should facilitate GW calculations for large systems. Our implementation is intended as a step forward towards the goal of predicting, prior to their synthesis, the ionization energies and electron affinities of the large molecules that serve as constituents of organic semiconductors. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Reference quality conformational energies have been obtained for the 52 unique conformers of melatonin by means of explicitly correlated ab initio methods as well as the ccCA composite method. These data have then been used to evaluate more approximate methods, including a variety of density functionals both on their own and paired with various empirical dispersion corrections. Owing to the presence of internal contacts of the C-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}O and C-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}N variety, basis set convergence is much slower than for alkane conformers, for example, and basis sets of aug-cc-pVQZ or def2-QZVP quality seem to be required to obtain firm estimates of the basis set limit. Not just HF, but also many DFT functionals, will transpose the two lowest conformers unless empirical dispersion corrections are added. Somewhat surprisingly, many DFT functionals reproduce the reference data to fairly high accuracy when combined with the D3BJ empirical dispersion correction or the "nonlocal" Vydrov-Van Voorhis dispersion model. The two best performers including dispersion corrections are the double hybrids DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ and B2GP-PLYP-D; if no such correction is permitted, then M06-2X puts in the best performance.

This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S=1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10-9. The method can be applied to almost any one-dimensional quantum lattice system, and can provide a wide variety of static properties. {\textcopyright} 1993 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Neumann1996a,
abstract = {The commonly used exchange-correlation functionals of density functional theory and their potentials are examined numerically following the first such investigation by Perdew. They are also investigated for Ne and Kr. Their behaviour for large gradients of the density and for large distances is not satisfactory. In particular, the correct asymptotic r(-1) behaviour is difficult to achieve. Following van Leeuwen and Baerends, this is linked to the energy epsilon(max) of the highest occupied orbital arising from the Kohn-Sham equations. This deficiency is linked also with the poor prediction of molecular polarizabilities. The Becke-Roussel (BR) exchange functional is examined, which is derived by assuming a hydrogen-like exchange hole at all spatial points, and it has the attraction of being dependent on both the kinetic energy density and the Laplacian of the density and has no adjustable parameters. Becke has presented encouraging results using this functional in a hybrid manner. Fully self-consistent Kohn-Sham calculations are performed using it in combination with Perdew's 1986 correlation functional. The results are very encouraging indeed, so much so that this exchange functional is the best generalized gradient approximation (GGA) yet discovered. In particular, bond lengths of many molecular show a substantial improvement over results from other GGAs. For example, many CH bonds are now within experimental accuracy, instead of being typically 0 . 02 Angstrom too long. Our ab initio understanding of non-dynamic correlation and dynamic correlation is then linked with density functional theory. It is argued that correlation functionals should pick up the local dynamic correlation, whereas exchange functionals should include non-dynamic correlation effects. For these reasons it is considered that exchange functionals are best modelled on a system fbr which there is effectively no non-dynamic correlation, for which the optimum example is the Ne atom. Thus, again following Becke and Roussel, the spherically averaged Hartree-Fock exchange hole for Ne is examined, compared with the BR model functional hole. An excellent overlap is found, and thus the above good results are explained. As a final contribution, the dissociation of the H-2 molecule is re-examined, looking at it in terms of the exchange hole. For a reference electron near one proton A, the restricted Hartree-Fock model has half an exchange electron near it, and half and exchange electron near the other protron B, whereas the BR functional has one electron near the other proton B, whereas the BR functional has one electron near A, which is the correct picture. For this reason the (restricted) BR functional gives a greatly improved dissociation curve for H-2 when compared with the Hartree-Fock curve. In summary, the Becke-Roussel functional is found to be a most attractive exchange functional.},

The method proposed here to treat the singularities constitutes a stable, simple to implement, and general scheme that can be applied to systems with arbitrary lattice parameters within either the EXX Kohn-Sham or the HF formalism. We apply the singularity correction to a typical symmetric structure, diamond, and to a more general structure, trans-polyacetylene. We consider the effect of the singularity corrections on volume optimizations and k -point convergence.

In 1960, Luttinger postulated that the area enclosed by the Fermi surface should remain unaffected even when electron-electron interaction is turned on, so long as the interaction does not cause a phase transition. Understanding what determines the Fermi surface size is a crucial and yet unsolved problem in strongly interacting systems such as high-Tc superconductors. Here we present a precise test of the Luttinger theorem for a two-dimensional Fermi liquid system where the exotic quasiparticles themselves emerge from the strong interaction, namely, for the Fermi sea of composite fermions (CFs). Via direct, geometric resonance measurements of the CFs' Fermi wave vector down to very low electron densities, we show that the Luttinger theorem is obeyed over a significant range of interaction strengths, in the sense that the Fermi sea area is determined by the density of the minority carriers in the lowest Landau level. Our data also address the ongoing debates on whether or not CFs obey particle-hole symmetry, and if they are Dirac particles. We find that particle-hole symmetry is obeyed, but the measured Fermi sea area differs quantitatively from that predicted by the Dirac model for CFs.},

When the degeneracy of the reference state is partially or fully lifted at the first-order Hirschfelder-Certain degenerate perturbation theory, the second-order grand potential and internal energy diverge as T→0. Contrary to earlier suggestions of renormalizability by the chemical potential $\mu$, this nonconvergence, first suspected by Kohn and Luttinger, is caused by the nonanalytic nature of the Boltzmann factor e-E/kBT at T=0, also plaguing the canonical ensemble, which does not involve $\mu$. The finding reveals a fundamental flaw in perturbation theory, which is deeply rooted in the mathematical limitation of power-series expansions and is unlikely to be removed within its framework.},

The results for the outer‐valence IPs, with an average error of 0.12 eV, compare favorably to third‐order equation‐of‐motion calculations within the same basis set (average error 0.28 eV) and outer‐valence GF (OVGF) values taken from the literature (average error 0.17 eV). Ground‐state properties that derive from the CCGF are compared to expectation values obtained in the related normal coupled cluster methods (NCCM) approximation from a formal point of view. Correlation energies obtained in CCGF are compared to CCSD results for the above series of molecules and, in addition, the so‐called true correlation energy density as obtained from the CCGF is compared to the result from an accurate MR–CI calculation for a highly correlated system: the HF molecule at large internuclear separation. {\textcopyright} 1993 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

We find an increase in the weight of the quasiparticle as compared to ordinary non-self-consistent calculations but also to calculations with partial self-consistency using a fixed (Formula presented) The quasiparticle bandwidth is larger than that of free electrons and the satellite structure is broad and featureless; both results clearly contradict the experimental evidence. The total energy, though, is as accurate as that from quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and its derivative with respect to particle number agrees with the Fermi energy as obtained directly from the pole of the Green's function at the Fermi level.

abstract = {High-quality benchmark computations are critical for the development and assessment of approximate methods to describe noncovalent interactions. Recent advances in the treatment of dispersion by density functional theory and also the development of more efficient wave function techniques to reliably address noncovalent interactions motivate new benchmark computations of increasing accuracy. This work considers focal point approximations to estimate the complete basis set limit of coupled-cluster theory through perturbative triples [CCSD(T)/CBS] and evaluates how this approach is affected by the use or absence of counterpoise (CP) correction or, as has recently gained traction, the average of those values. Current benchmark protocols for interaction energies are computed with all CP procedures and assessed against the A24 and S22B databases and also to highly converged results for formic acid, cyanogen, and benzene dimers. Whether CP correction, no correction, or the average is favored depends upon the theoretical method, basis set, and binding motif. In recent high-quality benchmark studies, interaction energies often use second-order perturbation theory with extrapolated aug-cc-pVTZ (aTZ) and aug-cc-pVQZ (aQZ) basis sets [MP2/aTQZ] combined with a "coupled-cluster correction," $\delta$MP2CCSD(T), evaluated in an aug-cc-pVDZ basis. For such an approach, averaging CP-corrected and uncorrected values for the MP2 component and using CP-corrected $\delta$MP2CCSD(T) values offers errors more balanced among binding motifs and generally more favorable overall. Other combinations of counterpoise correction are not quite as accurate. When employing MP2/aQ5Z extrapolations and an aTZ basis for $\delta$MP2CCSD(T), using CP-corrected or averaged MP2 estimates are about equally effective (and slightly superior to uncorrected MP2 values), but the counterpoise treatment of $\delta$MP2CCSD(T) makes little difference. Focal point estimates at this level achieve benchmark quality results otherwise accessible only with CCSD(T)/aQZ or better. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Integration of the atomic deformation densities — bonded minus free atoms — defines net atomic charges and multipole moments which concisely summarize the molecular charge reorganization. They permit calculation of the external electrostatic potential and of the interaction energy between molecules or between parts of the same molecule.

The spin-averaged local field correction G(q) is estimated numerically; the local field correction C(q) arising from only spin-antiparallel correlation is also estimated. It is pointed out that inclusion of short-range correlations is important for the quantitative estimation of the energy width of the quasiparticle(p) at metallic densities. Owing to the local field corrections and the energy width of the quasiparticle, the cutoff wave number qc estimated by the present theory is considerably reduced, compared with the random-phase approximation case. The spectral structure in S(q,) is numerically estimated from the wave number much smaller than qc up to the wave number twice as large as the Fermi wave number. The calculated plasmon dispersion around qc is in excellent agreement with the observed one for A1 in electron scattering experiments. In the intermediate wave-number region the calculated spectra of S(q,) reproduce distinctly a plasmonlike peak and a broad peak in good agreement with experimental observations. These characteristic features of S(q,) are ascribed to the striking damping effect of one-electron states originating from virtual plasmon emission under the influence of strong short-range correlations at metallic densities. {\textcopyright} 1982 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A common perception about molecular systems with a nonlocal electronic structure (as manifested by a nonlocal Hartree–Fock (HF) density matrix), such as conjugated $\pi$-systems, is that they can only be described in terms of nonlocal molecular orbitals. This view is mostly founded on chemical intuition, and further, this view is strengthened by traditional approaches for obtaining local occupied and virtual orbital spaces, such as the occupied Pipek–Mezey orbitals, and projected atomic orbitals. In this article, we discuss the limitations for localizability of HF orbitals in terms of restrictions posed by the delocalized character of the underlying density matrix for the molecular system and by the orthogonality constraint on the molecular orbitals. We show that the locality of the orbitals, in terms of nonvanishing charge distributions of orbitals centered far apart, is much more strongly affected by the orthogonality constraint than by the physical requirement that the occupied orbitals must represent the electron density. Thus, the freedom of carrying out unitary transformations among the orbitals provides the flexibility to obtain highly local occupied and virtual molecular orbitals, even for molecular systems with a nonlocal density matrix, provided that a proper localization function is used. As an additional consideration, we clear up the common misconception that projected atomic orbitals in general are more local than localized orthogonal virtual orbitals.},

abstract = {We develop a new formulation of the functional renormalization group (RG) for interacting fermions. Our approach unifies the purely fermionic formulation based on the Grassmannian functional integral, which has been used in recent years by many authors, with the traditional Wilsonian RG approach to quantum systems pioneered by Hertz [Phys. Rev. B 14, 1165 (1976)], which attempts to describe the infrared behavior of the system in terms of an effective bosonic theory associated with the soft modes of the underlying fermionic problem. In our approach, we decouple the interaction by means of a suitable Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation (following the Hertz approach), but do not eliminate the fermions; instead, we derive an exact hierarchy of RG flow equations for the irreducible vertices of the resulting coupled field theory involving both fermionic and bosonic fields. The freedom of choosing a momentum transfer cutoff for the bosonic soft modes in addition to the usual band cutoff for the fermions opens the possibility of new RG schemes. In particular, we show how the exact solution of the Tomonaga-Luttinger model (i.e., one-dimensional fermions with linear energy dispersion and interactions involving only small momentum transfers) emerges from the functional RG if one works with a momentum transfer cutoff. Then the Ward identities associated with the local particle conservation at each Fermi point are valid at every stage of the RG flow and provide a solution of an infinite hierarchy of flow equations for the irreducible vertices. The RG flow equation for the irreducible single-particle self-energy can then be closed and can be reduced to a linear integrodifferential equation, the solution of which yields the result familiar from bosonization. We suggest new truncation schemes of the exact hierarchy of flow equations, which might be useful even outside the weak coupling regime. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

The more rigorous scheme, W2 (Weizmann-2) theory, contains no empirical parameters at all and yields a mean absolute error of 0.23 kcal/mol, which is lowered to 0.18 kcal/mol for molecules dominated by dynamical correlation. It involves CCSD calculations in spdfg and spdfgh basis sets and CCSD(T) calculations in spdf and spdfg basis sets. On workstation computers, molecules with up to three heavy atoms can be treated using conventional coupled cluster algorithms, while larger systems can still be treated using a direct CCSD code. Both schemes include corrections for scalar relativistic effects, which are found to be vital for accurate results on second-row compounds. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In previous publications (especially by Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham), a theory of the ground state of an inhomogeneous interacting electron gas was developed, in which the electronic density n(r) played a dominant role. The present paper extends this approach to the one-particle Green's function and physical properties related to it, such as single-particle-like excitations and, in the case of metals, the Fermi surface. The Dyson mass operator is studied as a function of its spatial arguments and as a functional of n(r), and, in both senses, it is found to have important short-range properties. An approximation for , which is exact for systems of slowly varying density, is proposed. This leads to simple, explicit, Schr{\"{o}}dinger-like equations for the single-particle-like excitations, whose solution determines their energies and lifetimes. In particular, we show how to apply this procedure to metals. {\textcopyright} 1966 The American Physical Society.},

We calculate the formation and migration energies of self-interstitials and vacancies taking into account atomic relaxations.

The fitting error in the correlation energy is systematic and considerably smaller than the deviation between the local and the canonical CCSD energy. In order to restore () scaling locality must be exploited for the fitting functions as well as for orbitals. Local fitting domains specified for individual centre pairs provide an adequate basis for such a local description, however, Dunlap's robust formula for the approximate integrals then no longer simplifies to the usual expression known as the V approximation. A symmetric formula is proposed as an alternative, which, although formally non-robust, yields virtually the same results as the robust formalism. The additional fitting error due to the introduction of local fitting domains is considerably smaller than the original fitting error itself (by at least an order of magnitude). Test calculations demonstrate () scaling for the new LDF-LCCSD method. The approximate calculation of the 4-external integrals via density fitting in LDF-LCCSD is 10–100 times faster than the exact calculation via the () 4-index transformation in LCCSD.},

abstract = {Vertical ionization energies of the nucleosides cytidine and deoxythymidine in water, the lowest ones amounting in both cases to 8.3 eV, are obtained from photoelectron spectroscopy measurements in aqueous microjets. Ab initio calculations employing a nonequilibrium polarizable continuum model quantitatively reproduce the experimental spectra and provide molecular interpretation of the individual peaks of the photoelectron spectrum, showing also that lowest ionization originates from the base. Comparison of calculated vertical ionization potentials of pyrimidine bases, nucleosides, and nucleotides in water and in the gas phase underlines the dramatic effect of bulk hydration on the electronic structure. In the gas phase, the presence of sugar and, in particular, of phosphate has a strong effect on the energetics of ionization of the base. Upon bulk hydration, the ionization potential of the base in contrast becomes rather insensitive to the presence of the sugar and phosphate, which indicates a remarkable screening ability of the aqueous solvent. Accurate aqueous-phase vertical ionization potentials provide a significant improvement to the corrected gas-phase values used in the literature and represent important information in assessing the threshold energies for photooxidation and oxidation free energies of solvent-exposed DNA components. Likewise, such energetic data should allow improved assessment of delocalization and chargehopping mechanisms in DNA ionized by radiation. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

We present a local basis set formulation of the BSE for molecules where the optical spectrum is computed with the iterative Haydock recursion scheme, leading to a low computational complexity and memory footprint. Using a variant of the algorithm we can go beyond the Tamm-Dancoff approximation. We rederive the recursion relations for general matrix elements of a resolvent, show how they translate into continued fractions, and study the convergence of the method with the number of recursion coefficients and the role of different terminators. Due to the locality of the basis functions the computational cost of each iteration scales asymptotically as O(N3) with the number of atoms, while the number of iterations typically is much lower than the size of the underlying electron-hole basis. In practice we see that, even for systems with thousands of orbitals, the runtime will be dominated by the O(N2) operation of applying the Coulomb kernel in the atomic orbital representation.},

abstract = {To improve the accuracy of local coupled cluster (LCC) methods in computing activation energies, we propose herein a new computational scheme. Its applications to various types of late-transition-metal-catalyzed reactions involving Au, Pt, and Ir indicate that the new corrective approach for LCC methods can downsize the mean unsigned deviation and maximum deviation, from the CCSD(T)/CBS reference, to about 0.3 and 0.9 kcal/mol. Using this method, we also calibrated the performance of popular density functionals, with respect to the same test set of reactions. It is concluded that the best functional is the general-purpose double hybrid functional B2GP-PLYP. Other well-performing functionals include the "kinetic" functionals M06-2X and BMK, which have a large percentage of HF exchange, and general-purpose functionals like PBE0 and wB97X. Comparatively, general-purpose functionals like PBE0 and TPSSh perform much better than the tested "kinetic" functionals for Pt-/Ir-catalyzed reactions, while the opposite is true for Au-catalyzed reactions. In contrast, wB97X performs more uniformly in these two classes of reactions. These findings hint that even within the scope of late transition metals, different types of reactions may require different types of optimal DFT methods. Empirical dispersion correction of DFT was found to have a small or no effect on the studied reactions barriers. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

Therefore, it is timely to test the accuracy of quantum chemical methods for CT states, as well. In this study we first propose a new benchmark set consisting of dimers having low-energy CT states. On this set, the vertical excitation energy has been calculated with Coupled Cluster methods including triple excitations (CC3, CCSDT-3, CCSD(T)(a)*), as well as with methods including full or approximate doubles (CCSD, STEOM-CCSD, CC2, ADC(2), EOM-CCSD(2)). The results show that the popular CC2 and ADC(2) methods are much less accurate for CT states than for valence states. On the other hand, EOM-CCSD seems to have similar systematic overestimation of the excitation energies for both types of states. Among the triples methods the novel EOM-CCSD(T)(a)∗ method including noniterative triple excitations is found to stand out with its consistently good performance for all types of states, delivering essentially EOM-CCSDT quality results.},

abstract = {In this paper, the possibility is explored to speed up Hartree-Fock and hybrid density functional calculations by forming the Coulomb and exchange parts of the Fock matrix by different approximations. For the Coulomb part the previously introduced Split-RI-J variant (F. Neese, J. Comput. Chem. 24 (2003) 1740) of the well-known 'density fitting' approximation is used. The exchange part is formed by semi-numerical integration techniques that are closely related to Friesner's pioneering pseudo-spectral approach. Our potentially linear scaling realization of this algorithm is called the 'chain-of-spheres exchange' (COSX). A combination of semi-numerical integration and density fitting is also proposed. Both Split-RI-J and COSX scale very well with the highest angular momentum in the basis sets. It is shown that for extended basis sets speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional implementations can be obtained in this way. Total energies are reproduced with an average error of {\textless}0.3 kcal/mol as determined from extended test calculations with various basis sets on a set of 26 molecules with 20-200 atoms and up to 2000 basis functions. Reaction energies agree to within 0.2 kcal/mol (Hartree-Fock) or 0.05 kcal/mol (hybrid DFT) with the canonical values. The COSX algorithm parallelizes with a speedup of 8.6 observed for 10 processes. Minimum energy geometries differ by less than 0.3 pm in the bond distances and 0.5° in the bond angels from their canonical values. These developments enable highly efficient and accurate self-consistent field calculations including nonlocal Hartree-Fock exchange for large molecules. In combination with the RI-MP2 method and large basis sets, second-order many body perturbation energies can be obtained for medium sized molecules with unprecedented efficiency. The algorithms are implemented into the ORCA electronic structure system. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The GW approximation of many-body perturbation theory is an accurate method for computing electron addition and removal energies of molecules and solids. In a canonical implementation, however, its computational cost is O(N4) in the system size N, which prohibits its application to many systems of interest. We present a full-frequency GW algorithm in a Gaussian-type basis, whose computational cost scales with N2 to N3. The implementation is optimized for massively parallel execution on state-of-the-art supercomputers and is suitable for nanostructures and molecules in the gas, liquid or condensed phase, using either pseudopotentials or all electrons. We validate the accuracy of the algorithm on the GW100 molecular test set, finding mean absolute deviations of 35 meV for ionization potentials and 27 meV for electron affinities. Furthermore, we study the length-dependence of quasiparticle energies in armchair graphene nanoribbons of up to 1734 atoms in size, and compute the local density of states across a nanoscale heterojunction.},

abstract = {We report methodological and computational details of our Kohn-Sham density-functional method with Gaussian orbitals for systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our approach for the Coulomb problem is based on the direct space fast multipole method, which achieves not only linear scaling of computational time with system size but also very high accuracy in all infinite summations. The latter is pivotal for avoiding numerical instabilities that have previously plagued calculations with large bases, especially those containing diffuse functions. Our program also makes extensive use of other linear-scaling techniques recently developed for large clusters. Using these theoretical tools, we have implemented computational programs for energy and analytic energy gradients (forces) that make it possible to optimize geometries of periodic systems with great efficiency and accuracy. Vibrational frequencies are then accurately obtained from finite differences of forces. We demonstrate the capabilities of our methods with benchmark calculations on polyacetylene, polyphenylenevinylene, and a (5,0) carbon nanotube, employing basis sets of double zeta plus polarization quality, in conjunction with the generalized gradient approximation and kinetic-energy density-dependent functionals. The largest calculation reported in this paper contains 244 atoms and 1344 contracted Gaussians in the unit cell. {\textcopyright} 2000 The American Physical Society.},

Here, we derive and implement, for the first time, the static and dynamic Bethe-Salpeter equations when one considers T-matrix quasiparticle energies and a T-matrix-based kernel. The performance of the static scheme and its perturbative dynamical correction are assessed by computing the neutral excited states of molecular systems. A comparison with more conventional schemes as well as other wave function methods is also reported. Our results suggest that the T-matrix-based formalism performs best in few-electron systems where the electron density remains low.},

The best performing functionals are M06-L, M06, and M06-2X in the M06 series, all having mean unsigned deviations (MUD) less than 2 kcal/mol. The worst performing functional is OLYP, with a distinctly large MUD of more than 10 kcal/mol. Considering also the trends in barrier heights and the systematic barrier height deviation, our best recommended functional is M06-2X. In this work, DFT empirical dispersion correction (DFT-D3) is found to improve the performance of barrier height values for most functionals (especially of OLYP and B3LYP).

abstract = {We present a plane-wave implementation of the G0W0 approximation within the projector augmented wave method code gpaw. The computed band gaps of ten bulk semiconductors and insulators deviate on average by 0.2eV (∼5{\%}) from the experimental values, the only exception being ZnO where the calculated band gap is around 1eV too low. Similar relative deviations are found for the ionization potentials of a test set of 32 small molecules. The importance of substrate screening for a correct description of quasiparticle energies and Fermi velocities in supported two-dimensional (2D) materials is illustrated by the case of graphene/h-BN interfaces. Due to the long-range Coulomb interaction between periodically repeated images, the use of a truncated interaction is found to be essential for obtaining converged results for 2D materials. For all systems studied, a plasmon-pole approximation is found to reproduce the full frequency results to within 0.2eV with a significant gain in computational speed. Throughout, we compare the G0W0 results with different exact exchange-based approximations.

abstract = {Here we report X-ray crystal structure, spectroscopic and theoretical characterization of Au 21 S(SAdm) 15 (SAdm = adamantanethiol). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction shows that the Au 21 S(SAdm) 15 nanomolecule exhibits a Au 12 cuboctahedral core missing one vertex surrounded by a single $\mu$ 3 sulfur atom (sulfide), five bridging thiols, two additional Au atoms, one monomeric Au(SR) 2 , and two trimeric Au 3 (SR) 4 staples, with the two trimeric staples being linked through a Au 2 (SR) unit with a thiolate ligand in $\mu$ 4 coordination. Compositional, electronic, optical, and structural features of this compound are clarified via nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nESI-MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), low-temperature UV− vis spectroscopy, and first-principles analysis. ■ INTRODUCTION Gold nanomolecules have a distinct number of gold atoms and thiolate ligands, Au x (SR) y , with unique spectroscopic, electro-chemical, chiral properties. 1−10 The type of ligands such as aliphatic versus aromatic or bulky versus slim play a crucial role in determining the size and composition of such nanomolecules.

The X-ray-resolved crystal structure of Au 21 S(SAdm) 15 shows that this species features the simultaneous presence of Au x (SR) x+1 staple motifs of different size (monomeric and trimeric) in the protecting shell, together with an extra triply coordinated sulfur atom, $\mu$ 3-S, and a tetra-coordinated sulfur atom, $\mu$ 4-S. While the $\mu$ 3-S atom has been previously observed in literature in the t-butyl thiolated Au 30 S(SR) 18 nanomolecule, 22 the $\mu$ 4-S species is unusual. (After completion of this work, we came across a recent publication that reported a different but related crystal structure of Au 21 (SAdm) 15. 23 A detailed comparison between the two structures is beyond the scope of this work. The structures reveal a similarity, but the extra $\mu$ 3-S sulfide in the present compound causes significant rearrangement in the outer layer of Au 21 S(SAdm) 15 .)

abstract = {Within many-body perturbation theory, we apply vertex corrections to various closed-shell atoms and to jellium, using a local approximation for the vertex consistent with starting the many-body perturbation theory from a Kohn-Sham Green's function constructed from density-functional theory in the local-density approximation. The vertex appears in two places-in the screened Coulomb interaction W and in the self-energy $\Sigma$ -and we obtain a systematic discrimination of these two effects by turning the vertex in $\Sigma$ on and off. We also make comparisons to standard GW results within the usual random-phase approximation, which omits the vertex from both. When a vertex is included for closed-shell atoms, both ground-state and excited-state properties demonstrate little improvement over standard GW. For jellium, we observe marked improvement in the quasiparticle bandwidth when the vertex is included only in W, whereas turning on the vertex in $\Sigma$ leads to an unphysical quasiparticle dispersion and work function. A simple analysis suggests why implementation of the vertex only in W is a valid way to improve quasiparticle energy calculations, while the vertex in $\Sigma$ is unphysical, and points the way to the development of improved vertices for ab initio electronic structure calculations. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The attraction density functional theory (DFT) has for electronic structure theory is that it is easier to do computationally than ab initio, correlated wavefunction methods, due to its effective one-particle structure. On the contrary, ab initio theorists insist on the ability to converge to the right answer in appropriate limits, but this requires a treatment of the reduced two-particle density matrix. DFT avoids that by appealing to an "existence" theorem (not a constructive one) that all its effects are subsummed into a DFT functional of the one-particle density. However, the existence of thousands of DFT functionals emphasizes that there is no satisfactory way to systematically improve the Kohn-Sham (KS) version as most changes in parameterization or formulation seldom lead to a new functional that is genuinely better than others. Some researchers in the DFT community try to address this issue by imposing conditions rigorously derived from exact DFT considerations, but to date, no one has shown how this route will ever lead to converged results even for the ground state, much less for all the other electronic states obtained from time-dependent DFT that are critically important for chemistry. On the contrary, coupled-cluster (CC) theory and its equation-of-motion extensions provide rigorous results for both that KS-DFT methods are attempting to emulate. How to use them and their exact formal properties to tie CC theory to an effective one-particle form is the target of this perspective. This route addresses the devil's triangle of KS-DFT problems: The one-particle spectrum, self-interaction, and the integer discontinuity.},

abstract = {We describe the clustered low-rank (CLR) framework for block-sparse and block-low-rank tensor representation and computation. The CLR framework exploits the tensor structure revealed by basis clustering; computational savings arise from low-rank compression of tensor blocks and performing block arithmetic in the low-rank form whenever beneficial. The precision is rigorously controlled by two parameters, avoiding ad-hoc heuristics, such as domains: one controls the CLR block rank truncation, and the other controls screening of small contributions in arithmetic operations on CLR tensors to propagate sparsity through expressions. As these parameters approach zero, the CLR representation and arithmetic become exact. As a pilot application, we considered the use of the CLR format for the order-2 and order-3 tensors in the context of the density fitting (DF) evaluation of the Hartree-Fock (exact) exchange (DF-K). Even for small systems and realistic basis sets, CLR-DF-K becomes more efficient than the standard DF-K approach, and it has significantly reduced asymptotic storage and computational complexities relative to the standard O(N3) and O(N4) DF-K figures. CLR-DF-K is also significantly more efficient-all while negligibly affecting molecular energies and properties-than the conventional (non-DF) O(N) exchange algorithm for applications to medium-sized systems (on the order of 100 atoms) with diffuse Gaussian basis sets, a necessity for applications to negatively charged species, molecular properties, and high-accuracy correlated wave functions.},

abstract = {This Minireview summarizes our current knowledge of the optical properties of photosystem II (PS-II) and how these properties are related to the photosynthetic function, that is, excitation energy transfer from the antenna complexes to the reaction center (RC) and the subsequent transmembrane charge separation in the latter. Interpretation of the optical spectra of PS-II is much more difficult than for the RC of purple bacteria, due to the "spectral congestion" problem, namely, the strong spectral overlap of optical bands in PS-II. Recent developments in deciphering the optical properties of the pigments in PS-II, the identification of functional states, and the kinetic details of the primary excitation energy and charge-transfer reactions are summarized. The spectroscopic term P680 that is generally used in the literature no longer indicates the same entity in its cationic and singlet excited form but different subsets of the six innermost pigments of the RC. The accessory chlorophyll ChlD1 forms a sink for singlet excitation and triplet energy and most likely represents the primary electron donor in PS-II. In this respect, a special chlorophyll monomer in PS-II plays the role of the special pair in purple bacteria. Evidence that exciton transfer between the core antenna complexes CP43 and CP47 and the RC is the bottleneck for the overall photochemical trapping of excitation energy in PS-II is discussed. A short summary is provided of PS-II of Acaryochloris marina, which mainly contains chlorophyll d instead of the usual chlorophyll a. This system does not suffer from the spectral congestion problem and, therefore, represents an interesting model system. The final part of this Minireview provides a discussion of challenging problems to be solved in the future. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract = {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C 6R-6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The "double counting" of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene {\textperiodcentered} H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initia calculations of the interaction energies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {We describe a complete set of algorithms for ab initio molecular simulations based on numerically tabulated atom-centered orbitals (NAOs) to capture a wide range of molecular and materials properties from quantum-mechanical first principles. The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute "ab initio molecular simulations" (FHI-aims) computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on NAOs. The focus here is on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, Hartree-Fock theory, and MP2/GW electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to meV-level total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as O(N) with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a ScaLapack-based, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling (CPU time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of CPUs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To employ the established computational schemes that have been developed for three-dimensional crystals, two-dimensional systems are typically treated in the repeated-slab approach. In this work we critically examine this approach and identify three important aspects for which the treatment of long-range screening in two dimensions differs from the bulk: (1) anisotropy of the macroscopic screening, (2) k -point sampling parallel to the surface, (3) periodic repetition and slab-slab interaction. For prototypical semiconductor (silicon) and ionic (NaCl) thin films we quantify the individual contributions of points (1) to (3) and develop robust and efficient correction schemes derived from the classic theory of dielectric screening. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

Singular value decomposition (SVD) of coupled cluster doubles amplitudes associated with the dispersion interactions is analyzed for a number of long-chain systems, including saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons and a silane chain. Further decomposition of the most important amplitudes obtained from these SVDs allows for the analysis of the dispersion-specific virtual orbitals that are naturally localized. Consistent with previous work on intermolecular dispersion interactions in dimers, it is found that three important geminals arise and account for the majority of dispersion interactions at the long range, even in the many body intramolecular case. Furthermore, it is shown that as few as three localized virtual orbitals per occupied orbital can be enough to capture all pairwise long-range dispersion interactions within a molecule.},

Comparison with the results of traditional iterative localization schemes shows minor differences with respect to a number of suitable measures of locality, particularly the scaling with system size of orbital pair domains used in local correlation methods. The Cholesky procedure for generating orthonormal localized orbitals is noniterative and may be made linear scaling. Although our present implementation scales cubically, the algorithm is significantly faster than any of the conventional localization schemes. In addition, since this approach does not require starting orbitals, it will be useful in local correlation treatments on top of diagonalization-free Hartree-Fock optimization algorithms.},

abstract = {The problem of the behavior of positrons and electrons in given external potentials, neglecting their mutual interaction, is analyzed by replacing the theory of holes by a reinterpretation of the solutions of the Dirac equation. It is possible to write down a complete solution of the problem in terms of boundary conditions on the wave function, and this solution contains automatically all the possibilities of virtual (and real) pair formation and annihilation together with the ordinary scattering processes, including the correct relative signs of the various terms. In this solution, the "negative energy states" appear in a form which may be pictured (as by St{\"{u}}ckelberg) in space-time as waves traveling away from the external potential backwards in time. Experimentally, such a wave corresponds to a positron approaching the potential and annihilating the electron. A particle moving forward in time (electron) in a potential may be scattered forward in time (ordinary scattering) or backward (pair annihilation). When moving backward (positron) it may be scattered backward in time (positron scattering) or forward (pair production). For such a particle the amplitude for transition from an initial to a final state is analyzed to any order in the potential by considering it to undergo a sequence of such scatterings. The amplitude for a process involving many such particles is the product of the transition amplitudes for each particle. The exclusion principle requires that antisymmetric combinations of amplitudes be chosen for those complete processes which differ only by exchange of particles. It seems that a consistent interpretation is only possible if the exclusion principle is adopted. The exclusion principle need not be taken into account in intermediate states. Vacuum problems do not arise for charges which do not interact with one another, but these are analyzed nevertheless in anticipation of application to quantum electrodynamics. The results are also expressed in momentum-energy variables. Equivalence to the second quantization theory of holes is proved in an appendix. {\textcopyright} 1949 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Forster2022a,
abstract = {With increasing inter-electronic distance, the screening of the electron-electron interaction by the presence of other electrons becomes the dominant source of electron correlation. This effect is described by the random phase approximation (RPA) which is therefore a promising method for the calculation of weak interactions. The success of the RPA relies on the cancellation of errors, which can be traced back to the violation of the crossing symmetry of the 4-point vertex, leading to strongly overestimated total correlation energies. By addition of second-order screened exchange (SOSEX) to the correlation energy, this issue is substantially reduced. In the adiabatic connection (AC) SOSEX formalism, one of the two electron-electron interaction lines in the second-order exchange term is dynamically screened (SOSEX({\$}W{\$},{\$}v{\_}c{\$})). A related SOSEX expression in which both electron-electron interaction lines are statically screened (SOSEX({\$}W(0){\$},{\$}W(0){\$})) is obtained from the {\$}G3W2{\$} contribution to the electronic self-energy. In contrast to SOSEX({\$}W{\$},{\$}v{\_}c{\$}), the evaluation of this correlation energy expression does not require an expensive numerical frequency integration and is therefore advantageous from a computational perspective. We compare the accuracy of the statically screened variant to RPA and RPA+SOSEX({\$}W{\$},{\$}v{\_}c{\$}) for a wide range of chemical reactions. While both methods fail for barrier heights, SOSEX({\$}W(0){\$},{\$}W(0){\$}) agrees very well with SOSEX({\$}W{\$},{\$}v{\_}c{\$}) for charged excitations and non-covalent interactions where they lead to major improvements over RPA.},

In this work, one such method, Molecular Tailoring Approach (MTA) has been interfaced with recently developed efficient M{\o}ller-Plesset second order perturbation theory (MP2) codes viz. IMS-MP2 and RI-MP2 to reap the advantage of both. An external driver script is developed for implementing MTA at the front-end and the MP2 codes at the back-end. The present version of the driver script is written only for a single point energy evaluation of a molecular system at a fixed geometry. The performance of these newly developed MTA-IMS-MP2 and MTA-RI-MP2 codes is extensively benchmarked for a variety of molecular systems vis-{\`{a}}-vis the corresponding actual runs. In addition to this, the performance of these programs is also critically compared with Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO), another popular fragment-based method. It is observed that FMO2/2 is superior to FMO3/2 and MTA with respect to time advantage; however, the errors of FMO2 are much beyond chemical accuracy. However, FMO3/2 is a highly accurate method for biological systems but is unsuccessful in case of water clusters. MTA produces estimates with errors within 1 kcal/mol uniformly for all systems with reasonable time advantage. Analysis carried out employing various basis sets shows that FMO gives its optimum performance only for basis sets, which does not include diffuse functions. On the contrary, MTA performance is found to be similar for any basis set used.},

At a root mean square deviation (RMSD) = 0.19 kcal/mol for the first-row molecules in the W4-11 benchmark dataset, W1-F12 is in fact superior to ordinary W1 theory. For the entire W4-11 set, W2-F12 yields a RMSD = 0.20 kcal/mol, comparable to 0.19 kcal/mol from ordinary W2 theory. The extended applicability ranges of W1-F12 and W2-F12 are not just due to the lower computational cost but also to greatly reduced memory and especially storage requirements. They are illustrated through applications to nucleic acids and to polyacenes (with up to four rings), for which the following revised gas-phase heats of formation are found: fH298 = 19.6 (benzene), 34.94 (naphthalene), 53.9, (anthracene), 73.9 (naphthacene/tetracene), 54.9 (adenine), -16.3 (cytosine), 5.1 (guanine), -80.6 (thymine), and -71.6 (uracil) kcal/mol. Our theoretical values for the DNA/RNA bases largely confirm recent predictions based on much lower-level calculations. The W1-F12 theoretical values for benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene are in very good to reasonable agreement with experiment. However, both W1-F12 and other computational estimates show that the accepted experimental value for naphthacene cannot be reconciled with those for the lower acenes: we suggest that fH298[naphthacene(g)] = 74.25 1 kcal/mol is a more realistic estimate. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A new hybrid density functional for general chemistry applications is proposed. It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (a(x)) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G297 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum a(x) is found to be quite large (53{\%} with c=27{\%}) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G297 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2 kcal/mol compared to about 3 and 5 kcal/mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minimum errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10-20 kcal/mol). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.},

abstract = {The question of which non-interacting Green's function 'best' describes an interacting many-body electronic system is both of fundamental interest as well as of practical importance in describing electronic properties of materials in a realistic manner. Here, we study this question within the framework of Baym-Kadanoff theory, an approach where one locates the stationary point of a total energy functional of the one-particle Green's function in order to find the total ground-state energy as well as all one-particle properties such as the density matrix, chemical potential, or the quasiparticle energy spectrum and quasiparticle wave functions. For the case of the Klein functional, our basic finding is that minimizing the length of the gradient of the total energy functional over non-interacting Green's functions yields a set of self-consistent equations for quasiparticles that is identical to those of the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) (van Schilfgaarde et al 2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 226402-4) approach, thereby providing an a priori justification for such an approach to electronic structure calculations. In fact, this result is general, applies to any self-energy operator, and is not restricted to any particular approximation, e.g., the GW approximation for the self-energy. The approach also shows that, when working in the basis of quasiparticle states, solving the diagonal part of the self-consistent Dyson equation is of primary importance while the off-diagonals are of secondary importance, a common observation in the electronic structure literature of self-energy calculations. Finally, numerical tests and analytical arguments show that when the Dyson equation produces multiple quasiparticle solutions corresponding to a single non-interacting state, minimizing the length of the gradient translates into choosing the solution with largest quasiparticle weight.},

Linear-scaling algorithms have been proposed to achieve linear-scaling calculations of these two steps, based on the sparse matrix technique and the locality of the Cholesky molecular orbitals. The present algorithm has been applied to compute the Boys localized orbitals in a number of systems including $\alpha$-helix peptides, water clusters, and protein molecules.

abstract = {A general and efficient approach for the calculation of Franck-Condon integrals (FCIs) of large molecules is presented. In a first step, by exploiting the diagonally dominant and sparse structure of the Duschinsky matrix, a model system is constructed for which the Duschinsky matrix takes a block-diagonal form. For each of these blocks separately, the FCIs are calculated discarding all below a certain threshold. From those integrals retained the FCIs of the model system are obtained by simple multiplication. These serve as an estimate for the FCIs of the exact system which are calculated for those integrals which lie above a certain threshold. By systematically decreasing the threshold, the simulation can be reliably converged to the exact result with an arbitrary accuracy. Using this scheme, a considerable reduction of the number of FCIs which have to be calculated is achieved which leads to an improved scaling behavior of the computational effort with system size. The approach has been tested thoroughly for a set of molecules including difficult cases. For the larger systems a speedup of up to three orders of magnitude compared to an exact calculation is observed while the errors can be kept negligible. With this approach accurate calculations of FCIs are feasible also for large molecules encountered in "real-life" chemistry, especially biochemistry and material science. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We introduce a representative benchmark database of 20 cycloreversion reaction energies obtained by means of the high-level W1 thermochemical protocol. We use these benchmark values to assess the performance of a variety of contemporary DFT, double-hybrid DFT (DHDFT), standard ab initio, and compound thermochemistry methods. We show that this set of reaction energies provides an extremely challenging test for nearly all of the considered DFT and DHDFT methods. For example, about 80{\%} of the considered functionals result in root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) above 10 kJ mol-1. The best DFT and DHDFT procedures are $\omega$B97X and DSD-PBEP86-D3, with RMSDs of 4.7 and 7.9 kJ mol-1, respectively. Coupled with the fact that the barrier heights for these reactions also pose a significant challenge for many DFT methods, this work shows that only a handful of functionals can quantitatively describe all aspects of the potential energy surface of this important class of reactions. In addition, this work shows that London dispersion effects are particularly large for this class of reactions. For example, empirical D3 dispersion corrections reduce the RMSDs for the DFT and DHDFT procedures by amounts ranging from 3.5 (PBE and B2K-PLYP) to 22.0 (BLYP) kJ mol-1.},

abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Alml{\"{o}}f, Taylor, and co-workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree-Fock calculations if the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen-containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Alml{\"{o}}f and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of correlation consistent basis sets, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99{\%} of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50{\%} more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94{\%}-97{\%} of the total (HF + 1 + 2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron. {\textcopyright} 1989 American Institute of Physics.},

The integral-direct, in-core, highly efficient domain construction technique of our local second-order M{\o}ller−Plesset (LMP2) scheme is extended to the CC level. The resulting scheme, which is also suitable for general-order LNO−CC calculations, inherits the beneficial properties of the LMP2 approach, such as the asymptotically linear-scaling operation count, the asymptotically constant data storage requirement, and the completely independent domain calculations. In addition to integrating our recent redundancy-free LMP2 and Laplace-transformed (T) algorithms with the LNO−CCSD(T) code, the memory demand, the domain and LNO construction, the auxiliary basis compression, and the previously rate-determining two-external integral transformation have been significantly improved. The accuracy of all of the approximations is carefully examined on medium-sized to large systems to determine reasonably tight default truncation thresholds. Our benchmark calculations, performed on molecules of up to 63 atoms, show that the optimized method with the default settings provides average correlation and reaction energy errors of less than 0.07{\%} and 0.34 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to the canonical CCSD(T) reference. The efficiency of the present LNO−CCSD(T) implementation is demonstrated on realistic, three-dimensional examples. Using the new code, an LNO−CCSD(T) correlation energy calculation with a triple-$\zeta$ basis set is feasible on a single processor for a protein molecule including 2380 atoms and more than 44000 atomic orbitals.},

The database includes noncovalent interactions, isomerization energies, thermochemistry, and barrier heights, as well as equilibrium bond lengths and equilibrium binding energies of noncovalent dimers. Additionally, the sensitivity of the Minnesota density functionals to the choice of basis set and integration grid is explored for both noncovalent interactions and thermochemistry. Overall, the main strength of the hybrid Minnesota density functionals is that the best ones provide very good performance for thermochemistry (e.g., M06-2X), barrier heights (e.g., M08-HX, M08-SO, MN15), and systems heavily characterized by self-interaction error (e.g., M06-2X, M08-HX, M08-SO, MN15), while the main weakness is that none of them are state-of-the-art for the full spectrum of noncovalent interactions and isomerization energies (although M06-2X is recommended from the 10 hybrid Minnesota functionals). Similarly, the main strength of the local Minnesota density functionals is that the best ones provide very good performance for thermochemistry (e.g., MN15-L), barrier heights (e.g., MN12-L), and systems heavily characterized by self-interaction error (e.g., MN12-L and MN15-L), while the main weakness is that none of them are state-of-the-art for the full spectrum of noncovalent interactions and isomerization energies (although M06-L is clearly the best from the four local Minnesota functionals).

In particular, we compare quasiparticle (QP) G0W0 with hybrid exchange correlation functional (HSE) density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the catechol-rutile TiO2(110) interface. In so doing, we provide a theoretical interpretation of ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES) experiments for this prototypical system. Specifically, we demonstrate that the position, presence, and intensity of peaks associated with catechol's HOMO, intermolecular OH-O bonds, and interfacial hydrogen bonds to the surface bridging O atoms (ObrH-C and ObrH-O) may be used to fingerprint deprotonation of catechol's OH anchoring groups. Furthermore, our results suggest deprotonation of these groups, while being nearly isoenergetic at high coverages, may significantly increase the photovoltaic efficiency of catechol-TiO2(110) interfaces.

It is based on calculating first the Green's function on the imaginary-frequency axis, followed by an analytic continuation to the real-frequency axis using Pad{\'{e}} approximants. The arbitrariness in choosing a suitable kernel in the conventional broadening approach is thereby removed and, furthermore, we find that the Pad{\'{e}} method is able to resolve fine details in spectral functions with less artifacts on the scale of $\omega$∼T. We discuss the convergence properties with respect to the NRG calculation parameters (discretization $\Lambda$, z-averaging, truncation cutoff) and the number of Matsubara points taken into account in the analytic continuation. We test the technique on the single-impurity Anderson model and the Hubbard model (within the dynamical mean-field theory). For the Anderson impurity model, we discuss the shape of the Kondo resonance and its temperature dependence. For the Hubbard model, we discuss the inner structure of the Hubbard bands in metallic and insulating solutions at half-filling, as well as in the doped Mott insulator. Based on these test cases, we conclude that the Pad{\'{e}} approximant approach provides improved results for spectral functions at low-frequency scales of $\omega$ T and that it is capable of resolving sharp spectral features also at high frequencies. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

Performance of this so-called MP2.5 (third-order scaling factor of 0.5) method has also been tested for 33 nucleic acid base pairs and two stacked conformers of porphine dimer. In all the test cases, performance of the MP2.5 method was shown to be superior to the scaled spin-component MP2 based methods, e.g. SCS-MP2, SCSN-MP2 and SCS(MI)-MP2. In particular, a very balanced treatment of hydrogen-bonded compared to stacked complexes is achieved with MP2.5. The main advantage of the approach is that it employs only a single empirical parameter and is thus biased by two rigorously defined, asymptotically correct ab-initio methods, MP2 and MP3. The method is proposed as an accurate but computationally feasible alternative to CCSD(T) for the computation of the properties of various kinds of non-covalently bound systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

The principal take-home message of the present paper is that dynamical kernels can provide, thanks to their frequency-dependent nature, additional excitations that can be associated to higher-order excitations (such as the infamous double excitations), an unappreciated feature of dynamical quantities. We also analyze, for each kernel, the appearance of spurious excitations originating from the approximate nature of the kernels, as first evidenced by Romaniello.

The GOEP is a nonlocal Hermitian potential that delivers the sets of occupied and virtual orbitals and minimizes the total energy. The GOEP optimization leads to the same minimum as does the orbital optimization. The GOEP method is promising as an effective optimization approach for orbital-dependent functionals, as demonstrated for the selfconsistent calculations of the random phase approximation (RPA) to the correlation functionals in the particle-hole (ph) and particle-particle (pp) channels. The results show that the accuracy in describing the weakly interacting van der Waals systems is significantly improved in the self-consistent calculations. In particular, the important single excitations contribution in non-self-consistent RPA calculations can be captured self-consistently through the GOEP optimization, leading to orbital renormalization, without using the single excitations in the energy functional.},

abstract = {Generally, the addition or removal of a single particle in a many-body system does not correspond to an exact eigenstate of the system. Thus the resulting coherent excitation evolves in time. As discussed here, the evolution at short times upon the excitation with the energy $\epsilon$ exhibits a quadratic decay [with the rate constant $\sigma$2($\epsilon$)]. Later on, after some time $\tau$($\epsilon$), the exponential decay sets in. It is governed by another rate constant $\gamma$($\epsilon$). This behavior is generic for many realistic finite and extended systems. For a finite system it is possible to assess this behavior full numerically using an exact solution of the many-body problem. We present a simple model for the electron spectral function that links together all three aforementioned parameters and give a prescription for how the energy uncertainty $\sigma$2($\epsilon$) can be computed within the many-body perturbation theory. Our numerical results demonstrate that the model approach accurately reproduces the exact spectral function in a large range of energies even in the case of fragmented many-body states. We show that the central quantity of this study $\sigma$2($\epsilon$) can easily be computed exactly or from approximate theories and, hence, can be used for their validation. We also point out how the set in time can be tested by means of attosecond spectroscopy. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

The self-consistent GW quasiparticle energies are compared to those obtained within the Local Density Approximation (LDA). The goal of the calculations is to understand systematic trends in the effects of electronic correlations on the quasiparticle energy bands of Pu as a function of the localisation of the f orbitals. We show that correlation effects narrow the f bands in two significantly different ways. Besides the expected narrowing of individual f bands (flatter dispersion), we find that an even more significant effect on the f bands is a decrease in the crystal-field splitting of the different bands.},

abstract = {We first attempt to determine a local exchange functional Ex[$\rho$] which accurately reproduces the Hartree-Fock (HF) energies of the 18 first and second row atoms. Ex[$\rho$] is determined from $\rho$ and [∇$\rho$], and we find that we can improve significantly upon Becke's original generalized gradient approximation functional (commonly called B88X) by allowing the coefficient of the Dirac exchange term to be optimized (it is argued that molecules do not behave like the uniform electron gas). We call this new two parameter exchange functional OPTX. We find that neither ∇2 $\rho$ or $\tau$ = $\Sigma$ |∇$\phi$i|2 improve the fit to these atomic energies. These exchange functionals include not only exchange, but also left-right correlation. It is therefore proposed that this functional provides a definition for exchange energy plus left-right correlation energy when used in Kohn-Sham (KS) calculations. We call this energy the Kohn-Sham exchange (or KSX) energy. It is shown that for nearly all molecules studied these KSX energies are lower than the corresponding HF energies, thus giving values for the non-dynamic correlation energy. At stretched geometries, the KSX energies are always lower than the HF energies, and often substantially so. Furthermore all bond lengths from the KSX calculations are longer than HF bond lengths and experimental bond lengths, which again demonstrates the inclusion of left-right correlation effects in the functional. For these reasons we prefer to split the correlation energy into two parts: left-right correlation energy and dynamic correlation energy, arguing that the usage of the words 'non-dynamic' or 'static' or 'near-degeneracy' is less meaningful. We recognize that this definition of KSX is not precise, because the definition of a local Ex[$\rho$] can never be precise. We also recognize that these ideas are not new, but we think that their importance has been insufficiently recognized in functional determination. When we include third row atoms in our analysis, we are unable to find a local exchange functional which is a substantial improvement over B88X for the reproduction of HF energies. This must arise from the effects of the core orbitals, and therefore we do not consider that this detracts from the improved accuracy of OPTX. We report some MCSCF calculations constructed from bonding-antibonding configurations, from which we attempt to calculate ab initio left-right correlation. There is only moderate agreement between the two approaches. Finally we combine the OPTX functional with established correlation functionals (LYP, P86, P91) to form OLYP, OP86 and OP91; OLYP is a great improvement on BLYP for both energy and structure, and OP86, OP91 are an improvement over BP86, BP91 for structure. The importance of the exchange functional for molecular structure is therefore underlined.},

Our method yields mean absolute deviations (MADs) for main group bond lengths that are consistently below 1 pm, rotational constants with MADs of 0.2{\%}, and noncovalent distances with MADs below 1{\%}. For a large database of general main group thermochemistry and kinetics (∼800 chemical species), one of the lowest weighted mean absolute deviations for long-range corrected meta-GGA functionals is achieved. Noncovalent interactions are of average quality, and hydrogen bonded systems in particular seem to suffer from overestimated polarization related to the self-interaction error of SCAN. We also discuss some consequences of numerical sensitivity encountered for meta-GGAs.},

abstract = {The relativistic S-matrix formalism of Feynman is applied to the bound-state problem for two interacting Fermi-Dirac particles. The bound state is described by a wave function depending on separate times for each of the two particles. Two alternative integral equations for this wave function are derived with kernels in the form of an expansion in powers of g2, the dimensionless coupling constant for the interaction. Each term in these expansions gives Lorentz-invariant equations. The validity and physical significance of these equations is discussed. In extreme nonrelativistic approximation and to lowest order in g2 they reduce to the appropriate Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. One of these integral equations is applied to the deuteron ground state using scalar mesons of mass $\mu$ with scalar coupling. For neutral mesons the Lorentz-invariant interaction is transformed into the sum of the instantaneous Yukawa interaction and a retarded correction term. The value obtained for g2 differs only by a fraction proportional to ($\mu$M)2 from that obtained by using a phenomenological Yukawa potential. For a purely charged meson theory a correction term is obtained by a direct solution of the relativistic integral equation using only the first term in the expansion of the kernel. This correction is due to the fact that a nucleon can emit, or absorb, positive and negative mesons only alternately. The constant g2 is increased by a fraction of 1.1($\mu$M) or 15 percent. {\textcopyright} 1951 The American Physical Society.},

This book serves as a unique source for information on advanced hydrogen generation systems and applications (including integrated systems, hybrid systems, and multigeneration systems with hydrogen production). Advanced and clean technologies are linked to environmental impact issues, and methods for sustainable development are thoroughly discussed. With Earth's fast-growing populations, we face the challenge of rapidly rising energy needs. To balance these we must explore more sustainable methods of energy production. Hydrogen is one key sustainable method because of its versatility. It is a constituent of a large palette of essential materials, chemicals, and fuels. It is a source of power and a source of heat. Because of this versatility, the demand for hydrogen is sure to increase as we aim to explore more sustainable methods of energy. Furthermore, Sustainable Hydrogen Production provides methodologies, models, and analysis techniques to help achieve better use of resources, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability. The book is intellectually rich and interesting as well as practical. The fundamental methods of hydrogen production are categorized based on type of energy source: electrical, thermal, photonic, and biochemical. Where appropriate, historical context is introduced. Thermodynamic concepts, illustrative examples, and case studies are used to solve concrete power engineering problems. Addresses the fundamentals of hydrogen production using electrical, thermal, photonic, and biochemical energies. Presents new models, methods, and parameters for performance assessment. Provides historical background where appropriate. Outlines key connections between hydrogen production methods and environmental impact/sustainable development.

The reference values are experimental results collected by Caricato for 30 valence excitations and 39 Rydberg excitations. All calculations employ time-dependent density functional theory in the adiabatic, linear-response approximation. As far as reasonable, all of the assignments are performed by essentially the same protocol as used by Caricato, and this allows us to merge our mean unsigned errors (MUEs) with the ones they calculated for both density functional and wave function methods. We find 21 of the 30 density functionals calculated here have smaller MUEs for the 30 valence states than what they obtained (0.47 eV) for the state-of-the-art EOM-CCSD wave function. In contrast, for all of density functionals the MUE for 39 Rydberg states is larger than that (0.11 eV) of EOM-CCSD. Merging the 30 density functionals calculated here with the 26 calculated by Caricato makes a set of 56 density functionals. Averaging the unsigned errors over both the valence excitations and the Rydberg excitations, none of the 56 density functionals shows a lower mean unsigned error than that (0.27 eV) of EOM-CCSD. Nevertheless, two functionals are successful in having an overall mean unsigned error of 0.30 eV, and another nine are moderately successful in having overall mean unsigned errors in the range 0.32-0.36 eV. Successful or moderately successful density functionals include seven hybrid density functionals with 41 to 54 Hartree-Fock exchange, and four range-separated hybrid density functionals in which the percentage of Hartree-Fock exchange increases from 0 to 19 at small interelectronic separation to 65-100 at long range. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We present a general implementation of the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) and Cholesky decomposition (CD) representations of electron repulsion integrals within the coupled-cluster with single and double substitutions (CCSD) and equation-of-motion (EOM) family of methods. The CCSD and EOM-CCSD equations are rewritten to eliminate the storage of the largest four-index intermediates leading to a significant reduction in disk storage requirements, reduced I/O penalties, and, as a result, improved parallel performance. In CCSD, the number of rate-determining contractions is also reduced; however, in EOM the number of operations is increased because the transformed integrals, which are computed once in the canonical implementation, need to be reassembled at each Davidson iteration. Nevertheless, for large jobs the effect of the increased number of rate-determining contractions is surpassed by the significantly reduced memory and disk usage leading to a considerable speed-up. Overall, for medium-size examples, RI/CD CCSD calculations are approximately 40{\%} faster compared with the canonical implementation, whereas timings of EOM calculations are reduced by a factor of two. More significant speed-ups are obtained in larger bases, i.e., more than a two-fold speed-up for CCSD and almost five-fold speed-up for EOM-EE-CCSD in cc-pVTZ. Even more considerable speedups (6-7-fold) are achieved by combining RI/CD with the frozen natural orbitals approach. The numeric accuracy of RI/CD approaches is benchmarked with an emphasis on energy differences. Errors in EOM excitation, ionization, and electron-attachment energies are less than 0.001 eV with typical RI bases and with a 10(-4) threshold in CD. Errors with 10(-2) and 10(-3) thresholds, which afford more significant computational savings, are less than 0.04 and 0.008 eV, respectively.},

A localized variant of the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation is employed to significantly reduce the computational cost of evaluating and storing the two-electron Coulomb repulsion integrals. We demonstrate that the error arising from localized RI approximation can be reduced to an insignificant level by enhancing the set of auxiliary basis functions, used to expand the products of two single-particle NAOs. An efficient algorithm is introduced to deal with the Coulomb singularity in the Brillouin zone sampling that is suitable for the NAO framework. We perform systematic convergence tests and identify a set of computational parameters, which can serve as the default choice for most practical purposes. Benchmark calculations are carried out for a set of prototypical semiconductors and insulators, and compared to independent reference values obtained from an independent G0W0 implementation based on linearized augmented plane waves (LAPWs) plus high-energy localized orbitals (HLOs) basis set, as well as experimental results. With a moderate (FHI-aims tier 2) NAO basis set, our G0W0 calculations produce band gaps that typically lie in between the standard LAPW and the LAPW+HLO results. Complementing tier 2 with highly localized Slater-type orbitals (STOs), we find that the obtained band gaps show an overall convergence towards the LAPW+HLO results. The algorithms and techniques developed in this work pave the way for efficient implementations of correlated methods within the NAO framework.},

abstract = {The broad use of organic semiconductors for optoelectronic applications relies on quantitative understanding and control of their spectroscopic properties. Of paramount importance are the transport gap-the difference between ionization potential and electron affinity-and the exciton binding energy-inferred from the difference between the transport and optical absorption gaps. Transport gaps are commonly established via photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopy (PES/IPES). However, PES and IPES are surface-sensitive, average over a dynamic lattice, and are subject to extrinsic effects, leading to significant uncertainty in gaps. Here, we use density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory to calculate the spectroscopic properties of two prototypical organic semiconductors, pentacene, and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), quantitatively comparing with measured PES, IPES, and optical absorption spectra. For bulk pentacene and PTCDA, the computed transport gaps are 2.4 and 3.0 eV, and optical gaps are 1.7 and 2.1 eV, respectively. Computed bulk quasiparticle spectra are in excellent agreement with surface-sensitive photoemission measurements over several eV only if the measured gap is reduced by 0.6 eV for pentacene and 0.6-0.9 eV for PTCDA. We attribute this redshift to several physical effects, including incomplete charge screening at the surface, static and dynamical disorder, and experimental resolution. Optical gaps are in excellent agreement with experiment with solid-state exciton binding energies of ∼0.5 eV for both systems; for pentacene the exciton is delocalized over several molecules and exhibits significant charge transfer character. Our parameter-free calculations provide new interpretation of spectroscopic properties of organic semiconductors critical to optoelectronics. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

All calculations are performed using a Slater type orbital (STO) basis set of triple-$\zeta$ (TZ) quality and the highly efficient pair atomic resolution of the identity approach for the exchange- and Coulomb-term of the KS matrix (PARI-K and PARI-J, respectively) and for the evaluation of the MP2 energy correction (PARI-MP2). Employing the quadratic scaling SOS-AO-PARI-MP2 algorithm, DHs based on the spin-opposite-scaled (SOS) MP2 approximation are benchmarked against a database of large molecules. We evaluate the accuracy of STO/PARI calculations for B3LYP as well as for the DH B2GP-PLYP and show that the combined basis set and PARI-error is comparable to the one obtained using the well-known def2-TZVPP Gaussian-type basis set in conjunction with global density fitting. While quadruple-$\zeta$ (QZ) calculations are currently not feasible for PARI-MP2 due to numerical issues, we show that, on the TZ level, Jacob's ladder for classifying DFAs is reproduced. However, while the best DHs are more accurate than the best hybrids, the improvements are less pronounced than the ones commonly found on the QZ level. For conformers of organic molecules and noncovalent interactions where very high accuracy is required for qualitatively correct results, DHs provide only small improvements over hybrids, while they still excel in thermochemistry, kinetics, transition metal chemistry and the description of strained organic systems.},

However, this conclusion rests on very compact ? of highly charged 1s2 and 1s2 2s2 systems, the divergence is due to one particular group's recently developed functionals, whereas other recent functionals perform well, and errors in ? were not compared to actual energies E[?] of the same distinct, compact systems, but to general errors for diverse systems. As argued here, a true path can only be defined for E[?]and ? for the same systems: By computing errors in E[?], it is shown that different functionals show remarkably linear error relationships between ? and E[?] on well-defined but different paths towards exactness, and the ranking in Science, 355, 6320, 2017, 49−52 breaks down. For example, M06-2X, said to perform poorly, performs very well on the E,? paths defined here, and local (non-GGA) functionals rapidly increase errors in E[?]due to the failure to describe dynamic correlation of compact systems without the gradient. Finally, a measure of "exactness" is given by the product of errors in E[?] and ?; these relationships may be more relevant focus points than a time line if one wants to estimate exactness and develop new exact functionals.

abstract = {We present the first steps to extend the Green's function GW method and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to molecular response properties such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indirect spin-spin coupling constants. We discuss both a nonrelativistic one-component and a quasi-relativistic two-component formalism. The latter describes scalar-relativistic and spin-orbit effects and allows us to study heavy-element systems with reasonable accuracy. Efficiency is maintained by the application of the resolution of the identity approximation throughout. The performance is demonstrated using conventional central processing units (CPUs) and modern graphics processing units (GPUs) for molecules involving several thousand basis functions. Our results show that a large amount of Hartree-Fock exchange is vital to provide a sufficient Kohn-Sham starting point to compute the GW quasi-particle energies. As the GW-BSE approach is generally less accurate for triplet excitations or related properties such as the Fermi-contact interaction, the admixture of the Kohn-Sham correlation kernel through the contracted BSE (cBSE) method improves the results for NMR coupling constants. This leads to remarkable results when combined with the eigenvalue-only self-consistent variant (evGW) and Becke's half and half functional (BH{\&}HLYP) or the CAM-QTP family. The developed methodology is used to calculate the Karplus curve of tin molecules, illustrating its applicability to extended chemically relevant molecules. Here, the GW-cBSE method improves upon the chosen BH{\&}HLYP Kohn-Sham starting points.},

abstract = {We investigate how the reduction of the virtual space affects coupled-cluster excitation energies at the approximate singles and doubles coupled-cluster level (CC2). In this reduced-virtual-space (RVS) approach, all virtual orbitals above a certain energy threshold are omitted in the correlation calculation. The effects of the RVS approach are assessed by calculations on the two lowest excitation energies of 11 biochromophores using different sizes of the virtual space. Our set of biochromophores consists of common model systems for the chromophores of the photoactive yellow protein, the green fluorescent protein, and rhodopsin. The RVS calculations show that most of the high-lying virtual orbitals can be neglected without significantly affecting the accuracy of the obtained excitation energies. Omitting all virtual orbitals above 50 eV in the correlation calculation introduces errors in the excitation energies that are smaller than 0.1 eV. By using a RVS energy threshold of 50 eV, the CC2 calculations using triple-$\chi$ basis sets (TZVP) on protonated Schiff base retinal are accelerated by a factor of 6. We demonstrate the applicability of the RVS approach by performing CC2/TZVP calculations on the lowest singlet excitation energy of a rhodopsin model consisting of 165 atoms using RVS thresholds between 20 eV and 120 eV. The calculations on the rhodopsin model show that the RVS errors determined in the gas-phase are a very good approximation to the RVS errors in the protein environment. The RVS approach thus renders purely quantum mechanical treatments of chromophores in protein environments feasible and offers an ab initio alternative to quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics separation schemes. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We calculated the vertical ionization energies (VIE) of 99 species in two ways to examine the accuracy of several long-range-corrected (LC) hybrid meta functionals in comparison with a gradient approximation (GA), global hybrids, and doubly hybrids. In the category of LC functionals, we examined both those with meta ingredients (i.e., that depend on the kinetic energy density) and those without them. The LC-hybrid meta functionals examined are M11, revM11, M11plus, and $\omega$B97M-V. The reference data used to assess accuracy consist of 95 molecules and 4 atoms in the GW100 set. The two methods studied are the $\Delta$SCF method (involving the difference of neutral and cation self-consistent field (SCF) energies) and the ionization energy theorem (involving the orbital energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO). We calculated linear correlation coefficients (r2) and mean absolute deviations (MADs) between each approach and the reference VIE value from the CCSD(T)/def2-TZVPP level of theory. We compared the new LC-hybrid meta calculations to calculations with the 10 functionals in a previous VIE study by Br{\'{e}}mond et al. and to the calculations with LC-BLYP (LC-Becke, Lee-Yang-Parr), CAM-B3LYP (Coulomb-attenuating-method Becke-3-parameter Lee-Yang-Parr), LC-$\omega$HPBE, and $\omega$B97X-D. The results show that Minnesota LC-hybrid meta functionals have the smallest mean absolute deviation of ionization energy theorem VIEs with the reference data; the LC-$\omega$HPBE functional also does quite well in this test. This is very encouraging and indicates that LC-hybrid meta functionals would be the best starting points for the tuning strategy that has been shown to be a very good procedure for improving time-dependent density functional calculations, and it also helps explain the good success of LC-hybrid meta functionals for molecular excitation energies.},

The framework presented is suitable for computing the energy of a finite or infinite system in contact with a heat and particle bath at finite temperature and chemical potential. FT-MBPT(2) may be applied if the system, at zero temperature, may be described using standard (i.e., zero-temperature) second-order many-body perturbation theory [ZT-MBPT(2)] for the energy. We point out that in such a situation, FT-MBPT(2) reproduces, in the zero-temperature limit, the energy computed within ZT-MBPT(2). In other words, the difficulty that has been referred to as the Kohn–Luttinger conundrum, does not occur. We comment, in this context, on a “renormalization” scheme recently proposed by Hirata and He.},

abstract = {Absorbance difference spectra associated with the light-induced formation of functional states in photosystem II core complexes from Thermosynechococcus elongatus and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (e.g., P+Pheo -,P+QA-,3P) are described quantitatively in the framework of exciton theory. In addition, effects are analyzed of site-directed mutations of D1-His198, the axial ligand of the special-pair chlorophyll PD1, and D1-Thr179, an amino-acid residue nearest to the accessory chlorophyll ChlD1, on the spectral properties of the reaction center pigments. Using pigment transition energies (site energies) determined previously from independent experiments on D1-D2-cytb559 complexes, good agreement between calculated and experimental spectra is obtained. The only difference in site energies of the reaction center pigments in D1-D2-cytb559 and photosystem II core complexes concerns Chl D1. Compared to isolated reaction centers, the site energy of ChlD1 is red-shifted by 4 nm and less inhomogeneously distributed in core complexes. The site energies cause primary electron transfer at cryogenic temperatures to be initiated by an excited state that is strongly localized on ChlD1 rather than from a delocalized state as assumed in the previously described multimer model. This result is consistent with earlier experimental data on special-pair mutants and with our previous calculations on D1-D2-cytb559 complexes. The calculations show that at 5 K the lowest excited state of the reaction center is lower by ∼10 nm than the low-energy exciton state of the two special-pair chlorophylls PD1 and PD2 which form an excitonic dimer. The experimental temperature dependence of the wild-type difference spectra can only be understood in this model if temperature-dependent site energies are assumed for ChlD1 and P D1, reducing the above energy gap from 10 to 6 nm upon increasing the temperature from 5 to 300 K. At physiological temperature, there are considerable contributions from all pigments to the equilibrated excited state P*. The contribution of ChlD1 is twice that of PD1 at ambient temperature, making it likely that the primary charge separation will be initiated by ChlD1 under these conditions. The calculations of absorbance difference spectra provide independent evidence that after primary electron transfer the hole stabilizes at PD1, and that the physiologically dangerous charge recombination triplets, which may form under light stress, equilibrate between ChlD1 and PD1. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

These divergences, a surprising hallmark of the breakdown of many-electron perturbation theory, have been recently observed in several contexts, including the dynamical mean-field solution of the Hubbard model. The numerical calculations for the AIM presented in this work, as well as their comparison with the corresponding results for the Hubbard model, allow us to clarify several open questions about the properties of vertex divergences in a particularly interesting context, the correlated metallic regime at low temperatures. Specifically, our analysis (i) rules out explicitly the transition to a Mott-insulating phase, but not the more general suppression of charge fluctuations (proposed in [O. Gunnarsson, Phys. Rev.

abstract = {Because the one-electron basis set limit is difficult to reach in correlated post-Hartree-Fock ab initio calculations, the low-cost route of using methods that extrapolate to the estimated basis set limit attracts immediate interest. The situation is somewhat more satisfactory at the Hartree-Fock level because numerical calculation of the energy is often affordable at nearly converged basis set levels. Still, extrapolation schemes for the Hartree-Fock energy are addressed here, although the focus is on the more slowly convergent and computationally demanding correlation energy. Because they are frequently based on the gold-standard coupled-cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations CCSD(T), correlated calculations are often affordable only with the smallest basis sets, and hence single-level extrapolations from one raw energy could attain maximum usefulness. This possibility is examined. Whenever possible, this review uses raw data from second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory, as well as CCSD, CCSD(T), and multireference configuration interaction methods. Inescapably, the emphasis is on work done by the author's research group. Certain issues in need of further research or review are pinpointed.},

abstract = {The search for new materials based on computational screening relies on methods that accurately predict, in an automatic manner, total energy, atomic-scale geometries, and other fundamental characteristics of materials. Many technologically important material properties directly stem from the electronic structure of a material, but the usual workhorse for total energies, namely density-functional theory, is plagued by fundamental shortcomings and errors from approximate exchange-correlation functionals in its prediction of the electronic structure. At variance, the GW method is currently the state-of-the-art ab initio approach for accurate electronic structure. It is mostly used to perturbatively correct density-functional theory results, but is, however, computationally demanding and also requires expert knowledge to give accurate results. Accordingly, it is not presently used in high-throughput screening: fully automatized algorithms for setting up the calculations and determining convergence are lacking. In this paper, we develop such a method and, as a first application, use it to validate the accuracy of G0W0 using the PBE starting point and the Godby-Needs plasmon-pole model (G0W0GN@PBE) on a set of about 80 solids. The results of the automatic convergence study utilized provide valuable insights. Indeed, we find correlations between computational parameters that can be used to further improve the automatization of GW calculations. Moreover, we find that G0W0GN@PBE shows a correlation between the PBE and the G0W0GN@PBE gaps that is much stronger than that between GW and experimental gaps. However, the G0W0GN@PBE gaps still describe the experimental gaps more accurately than a linear model based on the PBE gaps. With this paper, we hence show that GW can be made automatic and is more accurate than using an empirical correction of the PBE gap, but that, for accurate predictive results for a broad class of materials, an improved starting point or some type of self-consistency is necessary.},

abstract = {We present and benchmark a self-energy approach for quasiparticle energy calculations that goes beyond Hedin's GW approximation by adding the full second-order self-energy (FSOS-W) contribution. The FSOS-W diagram involves two screened Coulomb interaction (W) lines, and adding the FSOS-W to the GW self-energy can be interpreted as first-order vertex correction to GW (GW$\Gamma$(1)). Our FSOS-W implementation is based on the resolution-of-identity technique and exhibits better than O(N5) scaling with system size for small- to medium-sized molecules. We then present one-shot GW$\Gamma$(1) (G0W0T$\Gamma$0(1)) benchmarks for the GW100 test set and a set of 24 acceptor molecules. For semilocal or hybrid density functional theory starting points, G0W0T$\Gamma$0(1) systematically outperforms G0W0 for the first vertical ionization potentials and electron affinities of both test sets. Finally, we demonstrate that a static FSOS-W self-energy significantly underestimates the quasiparticle energies.},

To solve this problem, we derive within the GW formalism a generalized plasmon-pole model that accounts for lattice polarization. The resulting GW self-energy is used to calculate the band structures of a set of binary semiconductors and insulators. The lattice contribution always decreases the band gap. The shrinkage increases with the size of the longitudinal-transverse optical splitting and it can represent more than 15{\%} of the band gap in highly polar compounds, reducing the band-gap percentage error by a factor of 3. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

It is found that SCS-MP2 and the new perturbative B2-PLYP density functional provide accurate reaction barriers and outperform MP2 as well as standard density functionals such as B3-LYP. The new second-order based methods have the additional advantage that they perform better with increasing quality of the one-particle space, as is desired for a good quantum chemical method. The errors for the reaction enthalpies are in general larger than for the barriers when compared to CBS-QB3 literature values, which is related to strong changes in the electronic structures, but the deviations are again smaller than with MP2 or B3-LYP and are also more systematic. The results of a detailed basis set study suggest that properly polarized triple-zeta AO basis sets represent a good compromise between accuracy and computational speed. The combination of very inaccurate density functionals with small (double-zeta) basis sets, which yields good results for the initial part of the reactions due to error compensation, is not recommended.},

abstract = {Light-harvesting systems 2 and 3 (LH2 and LH3) act as antennas for the initial light capture by photosynthetic purple bacteria, thus initiating the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy. The main absorbers are carotenoids and bacteriochlorophylls (BChls), which harvest different parts of the solar spectrum. The first two optical transitions in BChl produce the Qy and Qx absorption bands. The large size of BChl molecules has prevented accurate computational determination of the electronic structures for the relevant states, until we recently succeeded in obtaining the excitation energies and transition dipole moments of the first (Qy) transition for all BChls in LH2 and LH3 using multi-state multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory calculations. In this work, we go one step further, compute the corresponding values for the Qx transition, in line with previous work [ J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139, 7558-7567 ], and compare and assess our data against excitation energies obtained through time-dependent density functional theory methods. Interestingly, we find that the two transitions respond differently to BChls' geometrical factors, such as the macrocycle ring curvature and the dihedral torsion of the acetyl moiety. These findings will aid the unraveling of structure-function relationships for absorption and energy transfer processes in purple bacteria, and once again this demonstrates the viability of multireference quantum chemical methods as computational tools for the photophysics of biomolecules.},

abstract = {Coupled-cluster theory offers today's reference quantum chemical method for most of the problems encountered in electronic structure theory. It has been instrumental in establishing the now well-known paradigm of converging, many-body methods, Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) for second, MBPT2, and fourth-order MBPT4; and coupled-cluster (CC) theory for different categories of excitations, singles, doubles, triples, quadruples (SDTQ). Although built on the same basic concept as configuration interaction (CI), many-body methods fundamentally improve upon CI approximations by introducing the property of size extensivity, meaning that contrary to any truncated CI all terms properly scale with the number of electrons in the problem. This fundamental aspect of many-electron methods leads to the exceptional performance of CC theory and its finite-order MBPT approximations plus its equation-of-motion extensions for excited, ionized, and electron attached states. This brief overview will describe formal aspects of the theory which should be understood by perspective users of CC methods. We will also comment on some current developments that are improving the theory's accuracy or applicability. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Total energies obtained from the Luttinger-Ward functional ELW[G] with simple, approximate Green functions as input, are shown to be in excellent agreement with the self-consistent results. This demonstrates that the Luttinger-Ward functional is a reliable method for testing the merits of different self-energy approximations without the need to solve the Dyson equation self-consistently. Self-consistent GW ionization potentials are calculated from the Extended Koopmans Theorem, and shown to be in good agreement with the experimental results. We also find the self-consistent ionization potentials to be often better than the non-self-consistent G0W 0 values.

abstract = {An analysis of Dunlap's robust fitting approach reveals that the resulting two-electron integral matrix is not manifestly positive semidefinite when local fitting domains or non-Coulomb fitting metrics are used. We present a highly local approximate method for evaluating four-center two-electron integrals based on the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation and apply it to the construction of the Coulomb and exchange contributions to the Fock matrix. In this pair-atomic resolution-of-the-identity (PARI) approach, atomic-orbital (AO) products are expanded in auxiliary functions centered on the two atoms associated with each product. Numerical tests indicate that in 1{\%} or less of all Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham calculations, the indefinite integral matrix causes nonconvergence in the self-consistent-field iterations. In these cases, the two-electron contribution to the total energy becomes negative, meaning that the electronic interaction is effectively attractive, and the total energy is dramatically lower than that obtained with exact integrals. In the vast majority of our test cases, however, the indefiniteness does not interfere with convergence. The total energy accuracy is comparable to that of the standard Coulomb-metric RI method. The speed-up compared with conventional algorithms is similar to the RI method for Coulomb contributions; exchange contributions are accelerated by a factor of up to eight with a triple-zeta quality basis set. A positive semidefinite integral matrix is recovered within PARI by introducing local auxiliary basis functions spanning the full AO product space, as may be achieved by using Cholesky-decomposition techniques. Local completion, however, slows down the algorithm to a level comparable with or below conventional calculations.},

All calculations are performed within the projector-augmented wave method using a basis set of Wannier functions augmented by numerical atomic orbitals. The GW self-energy is calculated on the real frequency axis including its full frequency dependence and off-diagonal matrix elements. The mean absolute error of the ionization potential (IP) with respect to experiment is found to be 4.4, 2.6, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.5 eV for DFT-PBE, DFT-PBE0, HF, G0 W0 [HF], and self-consistent GW, respectively. This shows that although electronic screening is weak in molecular systems, its inclusion at the GW level reduces the error in the IP by up to 50{\%} relative to unscreened HF. In general GW overscreens the HF energies leading to underestimation of the IPs. The best IPs are obtained from one-shot G0 W0 calculations based on HF since this reduces the overscreening. Finally, we find that the inclusion of core-valence exchange is important and can affect the excitation energies by as much as 1 eV. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

Thus, when investigating the behavior of the fermion propagator, for example, an Ansatz for the three-point vertex has to be made. While the well-known Ward identity determines the longitudinal part of this vertex in terms of the fermion propagator as shown by Ball and Chiu, it leaves the transverse part unconstrained. However, Brown and Dorey have recently emphasized that the requirement of multiplicative renormalizability is not satisfied by arbitrary Ansa{\$}iumltze for the vertex. We show how this requirement restricts the form of the transverse part. By considering the example of QED in the quenched approximation, we present a form for the vertex that not only satisfies the Ward identity but is multiplicatively renormalizable to all orders in leading and next-to-leading logarithms in perturbation theory and so provides a suitable Ansatz for the full three-point vertex. {\textcopyright} 1990 The American Physical Society.},

We pay particular attention to the symmetries of the different orbital sets and to the relationships between them and order them in a complete scheme that exhibits passages from one to the other through explicitly derived orthogonal transformations. Within this context we insert the study on the conservation of parity in the passage from the polar set to the parabolic one. We also show that - except for the spheroidal set - all alternatives for hydrogenic wave functions induce irreducible representations of the point group D2h, the "quaternion group."

The effects of short-range correlation are investigated here in the local spin density (LSD) approximation and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Results are presented for atoms, molecules, and jellium surfaces. It is found that (1) short-range correlation energies are less sensitive to the inclusion of density gradients than are full correlation energies, and (2) short-range correlation makes a surprisingly small contribution to surface and molecular atomization energies. In order to improve the accuracy of electronic-structure calculations, we therefore combine a GGA treatment of short-range correlation with a full RPA treatment of the exchange-correlation energy. This approach leads to jellium surface energies close to those of the LSD approximation for exchange and correlation together (but not for each separately). {\textcopyright} 1999 The American Physical Society.},

We test this approach, that we name RS-OEP2, on a set of small closed-shell atoms and molecules. For the commonly used value of the range-separation parameter $\mu$ = 0.5 bohr-1, we find that self-consistency does not seem to bring any improvement for total energies, ionization potentials, and electronic affinities. However, contrary to the non-self-consistent RSH+MP2 method, the present RS-OEP2 method gives a LUMO energy which physically corresponds to a neutral excitation energy and gives local exchange-correlation potentials which are reasonably good approximations to the corresponding Kohn-Sham quantities. At a finer scale, we find that RS-OEP2 gives largely inaccurate correlation potentials and correlated densities, which points to the need of further improvement of this type of range-separated double hybrids.},

A new radial limit is established at -2.87900 ± 0.00003, and this is used to discuss the convergence of such expansions in Legendre functions. The variation with scale factor is discussed in detail. The wave functions are analyzed in terms of natural spin orbitals (NSO's), which seem to have many advantages. The first NSO bears a striking resemblance to the Hartree-Fock function, and the first two together provide a close approximation to the solution of the extended Hartree-Fock equations with different orbitals for different electrons. An energy of -2.877924 is obtained for the best (u, v) function found. An analysis of the results suggests that inner orbitals may be better represented by pure exponentials than by Hartree-Fock orbitals whenever additional correlational degrees of freedom are permitted. Expressed in approximate NSO form, the wave function is almost invariant to choice of basis set, provided that the latter is reasonably chosen. In particular, the necessity of including continuum terms along with the discrete hydrogen-like set is demonstrated.},

To check whether a DSLE is present in GW, we propose an indicator that only invokes observables at integer particle numbers. For self-consistent calculations, we show that GW suffers from a small DSLE. Conversely, for perturbative G0W0 and G0W0+SOSEX calculations the DSLE depends on the starting point. We exploit this starting point dependence to reduce (or completely eliminate) the DSLE. We find that the agreement with experiment increases as the DSLE reduces. DSLE-minimized schemes thus emerge as promising avenues for future developments in MBPT.},

abstract = {We present a number of near-exact, nonrelativistic, Born-Oppenheimer reference data sets for the parametrization of more approximate methods (such as DFT functionals). The data were obtained by means of the W4 ab initio computational thermochemistry protocol, which has a 95{\%} confidence interval well below 1 kJ/mol. Our data sets include W4-08, which are total atomization energies of over 100 small molecules that cover varying degrees of nondynamical correlations, and DBH24-W4, which are W4 theory values for Truhlar's set of 24 representative barrier heights. The usual procedure of comparing calculated DFT values with experimental atomization energies is hampered by comparatively large experimental uncertainties in many experimental values and compounds errors due to deficiencies in the DFT functional with those resulting from neglect of relativity and finite nuclear mass. Comparison with accurate, explicitly nonrelativistic, ab initio data avoids these issues. We then proceed to explore the performance of B2x-PLYP-type double hybrid functionals for atomization energies and barrier heights. We find that the optimum hybrids for hydrogentransfer reactions, heavy-atoms transfers, nucleophilic substitutions, and unimolecular and recombination reactions are quite different from one another: out of these subsets, the heavy-atom transfer reactions are by far the most sensitive to the percentages of Hartree-Fock-type exchange v and MP2-type correlation x in an (x, y) double hybrid. The (42,72) hybrid B2K-PLYP, as reported in a preliminary communication, represents the best compromise between thermochemistry and hydrogen-transfer barriers, while also yielding excellent performance for nucleophilic substitutions. By optimizing for best overall performance on both thermochemistry and the DBH24-W4 data set, however, we find a new (36,65) hybrid which we term B2GP-PLYP. At a slight expense in performance for hydrogen-transfer barrier heights and nucleophilic substitutions, we obtain substantially better performance for the other reaction types. Although both B2K-PLYP and B2GP-PLYP are capable of 2 kcal/mol quality thermochemistry, B2GP-PLYP appears to be the more robust toward nondynamical correlation and strongly polar character. We additionally find that double-hybrid functionals display excellent performance for such problems as hydrogen bonding, prototype late transition metal reactions, pericyelic reactions, prototype cumulene-polyacetylene system, and weak interactions. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The asymptotic form of this expression for an N-configuration pair natural orbital expansion is Error(N×N)≃($\Sigma$$\mu$=1NC$\mu$)2 (-225/4608)N-1. The asymptotic form attributes the dominant variation in multiconfiguration pair correlation errors to an interference effect between low-lying natural orbitals. Three levels of extrapolation based on the asymptotic convergence of pair natural orbital expansions are examined. The first requires separate calculations with 5 and 14 natural orbitals. When applied to the helium atom, for which E(5)=-2.897 484 and E(14)=-2.901 697, the extrapolated value, E=- 2.903 724, is accurate to within 0.05{\%} of the error from the 14 natural orbital wave function (i.e., the absolute accuracy is ≲0.000001 hartree). The second extrapolation requires separate calculations with 5 and 14 pair MCSCF configurations and is accurate to within 2{\%} of the MCSCF (14) error (i.e., the absolute accuracy is ≲0.00005 hartree) for the helium isoelectronic series. The third extrapolation requires only the 5-configuration MCSCF calculation. This extrapolation is accurate to ∼10{\%} of the MCSCF (5) error (i.e., the absolute accuracy is ∼0.0005 hartree) for the cases examined, including CH2, Ne, He, and H2.

We demonstrate that the energy difference between the catechol LUMO and the TiO2 LUMO, which is associated with the injection loss in DSCs, may be reduced significantly by reducing the dimensions of nanostructured TiO2 and by functionalizing the TiO2 with wide-gap moieties, which contribute additional screening but do not interact strongly with the frontier orbitals of the TiO2 and the dye.

abstract = {We have added the nonlocal van der Waals correlation energy functional of Vydrov and Van Voorhis in 2010 (VV10NL) to the dual-hybrid direct random phase approximation (dRPA75) and second-order screened exchange (SOSEX75) for noncovalent interactions. The obtained methods are denoted as dRPA75-NL and SOSEX75-NL, and the corresponding short-range attenuation parameters are fitted with the large aug-cc-pV5Z basis set against the S66 dataset. Therefore, the dRPA75-NL method overcomes the error cancellation problem of the dRPA75 method with the relatively small aug-cc-pVTZ basis set for noncovalent interactions. Based on our benchmark computations, the dRPA75-NL and SOSEX75-NL methods perform very well on evaluating noncovalent interaction energies. Compared with the double-hybrid density functionals (DHDFs) of DSD-PBEP86-NL and DOD-PBEP86-NL, the dRPA75-NL and SOSEX75-NL methods perform much better on charge transfer interactions. Furthermore, the SOSEX75-NL method also gives insight into the development of computational methods for both closed-shell and open-shell noncovalent interactions. In summary, our computations demonstrate that even the full dRPA and SOSEX correlations still need additional dispersion corrections for noncovalent interactions.},

@article{Crittenden2013,
abstract = {It is commonly accepted in the scientific literature that the static correlation energy, Estat, of a system can be defined as the exact correlation energy of its valence electrons in a minimal basis. Unfortunately, the computational cost of calculating the exact correlation energy within a fully optimized minimal basis grows exponentially with system size, making such calculations intractable for all but the smallest systems. However, analogous to single-reference methods, it is possible to systematically approximate both the treatment of electron correlation and flexibility of the minimal basis to reduce computational cost. This yields a hierarchy of methods for calculating Estat, ranging from coupled cluster methods in a minimal atomic basis up to full valence complete active space methods with a minimal molecular orbital basis constructed from a near-complete atomic orbital basis. By examining a variety of dissociating diatomics, along with equilibrium and transition structures for polyatomic systems, we show that standard coupled cluster models with minimal atomic basis sets (e.g., STO-3G) offer a convenient and cost-effective hierarchy of black box estimates for Estat in small- to medium-sized systems near their equilibrium geometries. To properly describe homolytic bond dissociation, it is better to use a more flexible basis set expansion so that each atomic orbital can effectively adapt to its molecular environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

These three terms all involve a summation of certain types of diagrams to infinite order, and can be viewed as ''renormalization'' of the second-order direct, exchange, and single-excitation (SE) terms of Rayleigh-Schr{\"{o}}dinger perturbation theory based on a KS reference. In this work, we establish the concept of rPT2 and present the numerical details of our SOSEX and rSE implementations. A preliminary version of rPT2, in which the renormalized SE (rSE) contribution was treated approximately, has already been benchmarked for molecular atomization energies and chemical reaction barrier heights and shows a well-balanced performance. In this work, we present a refined version of rPT2, in which we evaluate the rSE series of diagrams rigorously. We then extend the benchmark studies to noncovalent interactions, including the rare-gas dimers, and the S22 and S66 test sets, as well as the cohesive energy of small copper clusters, and the equilibrium geometry of 10 diatomic molecules. Despite some remaining shortcomings, we conclude that rPT2 gives an overall satisfactory performance across different electronic situations, and is a promising step towards a generally applicable electronic-structure approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The random phase approximation (RPA) has received considerable interest in the field of modeling systems where noncovalent interactions are important. Its advantages over widely used density functional theory (DFT) approximations are the exact treatment of exchange and the description of long-range correlation. In this work, we address two open questions related to RPA. First, we demonstrate how accurately RPA describes nonadditive interactions encountered in many-body expansion of a binding energy. We consider three-body nonadditive energies in molecular and atomic clusters. Second, we address how the accuracy of RPA depends on input provided by different DFT models, without resorting to self-consistent RPA procedure, which is currently impractical for calculations employing periodic boundary conditions. We find that RPA based on the SCAN0 and PBE0 models, that is, hybrid DFT, achieves an overall accuracy between CCSD and MP3 on a data set of molecular trimers from Řez{\'{a}}{\v{c}} et al. (J. Chem. Theory. Comput. 2015, 11, 3065). Finally, many-body expansion for molecular clusters and solids often leads to a large number of small contributions that need to be calculated with high precision. We therefore present a cubic-scaling (or self-consistent field (SCF)-like) implementation of RPA in atomic basis set, which is designed for calculations with high numerical precision.},

abstract = {In this work, a systematic infrastructure is described that formalizes concepts implicit in previous work and greatly simplifies computer implementation of reduced-scaling electronic structure methods. The key concept is sparse representation of tensors using chains of sparse maps between two index sets. Sparse map representation can be viewed as a generalization of compressed sparse row, a common representation of a sparse matrix, to tensor data. By combining few elementary operations on sparse maps (inversion, chaining, intersection, etc.), complex algorithms can be developed, illustrated here by a linear-scaling transformation of three-center Coulomb integrals based on our compact code library that implements sparse maps and operations on them. The sparsity of the three-center integrals arises from spatial locality of the basis functions and domain density fitting approximation. A novel feature of our approach is the use of differential overlap integrals computed in linear-scaling fashion for screening products of basis functions. Finally, a robust linear scaling domain based local pair natural orbital second-order M{\"{o}}ller-Plesset (DLPNO-MP2) method is described based on the sparse map infrastructure that only depends on a minimal number of cutoff parameters that can be systematically tightened to approach 100{\%} of the canonical MP2 correlation energy. With default truncation thresholds, DLPNO-MP2 recovers more than 99.9{\%} of the canonical resolution of the identity MP2 (RI-MP2) energy while still showing a very early crossover with respect to the computational effort. Based on extensive benchmark calculations, relative energies are reproduced with an error of typically {\textless}0.2 kcal/mol. The efficiency of the local MP2 (LMP2) method can be drastically improved by carrying out the LMP2 iterations in a basis of pair natural orbitals. While the present work focuses on local electron correlation, it is of much broader applicability to computation with sparse tensors in quantum chemistry and beyond.},

Various different xc-kernels, which are all rooted in the homogeneous electron gas, are introduced but hereafter we focus on the specific class of renormalized adiabatic kernels, in particular the rALDA and rAPBE. The kernels drastically improve the description of short-range correlations as compared to the random phase approximation (RPA), resulting in significantly better correlation energies. This effect greatly reduces the reliance on error cancellations, which is essential in RPA, and systematically improves covalent bond energies while preserving the good performance of the RPA for dispersive interactions. For quasiparticle energies, the xc-kernels account for vertex corrections that are missing in the GW self-energy. In this context, we show that the short-range correlations mainly correct the absolute band positions while the band gap is less affected in agreement with the known good performance of GW for the latter. The renormalized xc-kernels offer a rigorous extension of the RPA and GW methods with clear improvements in terms of accuracy at little extra computational cost.},

Results of their extensive tests on molecules, solids, and solid surfaces are encouraging, suggesting that this density functional achieves uniform accuracy for diverse properties and systems. In the present work, this functional is explained and details of its construction are presented. In particular, the functional is constructed to yield accurate energies under uniform coordinate scaling to the low-density or strong-interaction limit. Its nonlocality is displayed by plotting the factor F(xc) that gives the enhancement relative to the local density approximation for exchange. We also discuss an apparently harmless order-of-limits problem in the meta-GGA. The performance of this functional is investigated for exchange and correlation energies and shell-removal energies of atoms and ions. Non-self-consistent molecular atomization energies and bond lengths of the TPSS meta-GGA, calculated with GGA orbitals and densities, agree well with those calculated self-consistently.

We show that the optical absorption spectrum of solids exhibiting a strong continuum excitonic effect is considerably improved with respect to calculations where the adiabatic local-density approximation is used. We discuss the limitations of this simple approach, and in particular that the same improvement cannot be found for the whole spectral range including the valence plasmons and bound excitons. On the other hand, we also show that within the range of validity of the method, the parameter a depends linearly on the inverse of the dielectric constant, and we demonstrate that this fact can be used to predict continuum excitonic effects in semiconductors. Results are shown for the real and imaginary part of the dielectric function of Si, GaAs, AlAs, diamond, MgO, SiC and Ge, and for the loss function of Si.},

abstract = {Quantum chemistry has become an invaluable tool for studying the electronic excitation phenomena underlying many important chemical, biological, and technological processes. Here, we review quantum-chemical approaches for modeling such phenomena. In particular, embedding methods can be particularly useful for treating localized excitations in complex chemical systems. These split the total system into a number of interacting subsystems. The electronic excitations processes occurring in the subsystem of interest are then treated with high accuracy, while its environment is taken into account in a more approximate way. In this review, we use a formulation based on the formally exact frozen-density embedding theory as our starting point. This provides a common framework for discussing the different embedding approaches that are currently available. Moreover, it also forms the basis of emerging methods that allow for a seamless coupling of density-functional theory and wavefunction based approaches, both for ground and excited states. These provide new possibilities for studying electronic excitations in large systems with predictive quantum-chemical methods. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Similar to other electron correlation methods, many-body perturbation theory methods based on Green's functions, such as the so-called GW approximation, suffer from the usual slow convergence of energetic properties with respect to the size of the one-electron basis set. This displeasing feature is due to the lack of explicit electron-electron terms modeling the infamous Kato electron-electron cusp and the correlation Coulomb hole around it. Here, we propose a computationally efficient density-based basis-set correction based on short-range correlation density functionals which significantly speeds up the convergence of energetics toward the complete basis set limit. The performance of this density-based correction is illustrated by computing the ionization potentials of the 20 smallest atoms and molecules of the GW100 test set at the perturbative GW (or G0W0) level using increasingly large basis sets. We also compute the ionization potentials of the five canonical nucleobases (adenine, cytosine, thymine, guanine, and uracil) and show that, here again, a significant improvement is obtained.},

We present ab initio many-body perturbation theory calculations of the Be2 interatomic potential using the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The ground-state correlation energy is calculated by the trace formula with checks against the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem formula. We show that inclusion of GW corrections already improves the energy even at the level of the random-phase approximation. At the level of the BSE on top of the GW approximation, our calculation is in surprising agreement with the most accurate theories and with experiment. It even reproduces an experimentally observed flattening of the interatomic potential due to a delicate correlations balance from a competition between covalent and van der Waals bonding.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group. In the past 30 years, Kohn–Sham density functional theory has emerged as the most popular electronic structuremethod in computational chemistry. To assess the ever-increasing number of approximate exchange-correlation functionals, this review benchmarks a total of 200 density functionals on a molecular database (MGCDB84) of nearly 5000 data points. The database employed, provided as Supplemental Data, is comprised of 84 data-sets and contains non-covalent interactions, isomerisation energies, thermochemistry, and barrier heights. In addition, the evolution of nonempirical and semi-empirical density functional design is reviewed, and guidelines are provided for the proper and effective use of density functionals. The most promising functional considered is $\omega$B97M-V, a range-separated hybrid meta-GGA with VV10 nonlocal correlation, designed using a combinatorial approach. From the local GGAs, B97-D3, revPBE-D3, and BLYP-D3 are recommended, while from the local meta-GGAs, B97M-rV is the leading choice, followed by MS1-D3 and M06-LD3. The best hybrid GGAs are $\omega$B97X-V, $\omega$B97X-D3, and $\omega$B97X-D, while useful hybrid meta-GGAs (besides $\omega$B97M-V) include $\omega$M05-D, M06-2X-D3, and MN15. Ultimately, today's state-of-the-art functionals are close to achieving the level of accuracy desired for a broad range of chemical applications, and the principal remaining limitations are associated with systems that exhibit significant selfinteraction/ delocalisation errors and/or strong correlation effects.},

By localizing the orbitals in each iteration and performing separate fits for each orbital the O(N-4) scaling of the computational effort for the exchange can be reduced to O(N). We also use the Poisson method to replace almost all Coulomb integrals with simple overlaps, an efficient alternative to diagonalization, and dual basis sets such that the Hartree-Fock calculation is performed in a smaller basis than the subsequent treatment of electron correlation. The accuracy and efficiency of the method is demonstrated in calculations with almost 4000 basis functions. The errors introduced by the local approximations on HF and MP2 energies are small compared to those that arise from the density fitting, and the fitting errors themselves (typically 1-10 microhartree per atom) are very small compared, for example, to the effect of basis set variations.},

However, accurate modeling of the conventional exchange hole presents a great challenge, due to the delocalization of the hole. Making use of the property that the hole can be made localized under a general coordinate transformation, here we derive an exchange hole from the density matrix expansion, while the correlation part is obtained by imposing the low-density limit constraint. From the hole, a semilocal exchange-correlation functional is calculated. Our comprehensive test shows that this functional can achieve remarkable accuracy for diverse properties of molecules, solids, and solid surfaces, substantially improving upon the nonempirical functionals proposed in recent years. Accurate semilocal functionals based on their associated holes are physically appealing and practically useful for developing nonlocal functionals.},

The TDHF formula is put into a form that enables one to apply the analytic tetrahedron method. Convergence studies show that a large number of tetrahedrons are required to accurately compute the first or random-phase approximation (RPA) term in the TDHF susceptibility, while a smaller number are required for the second or exchange term. Hartree-Fock (HF) energies and an rs value of 1.74 were used to compute both terms in the TDHF susceptibility as a function of wave vector q. The second or exchange term was found to be of the same order of magnitude as the first or RPA term. The full TDHF susceptibility was found to differ substantially from the RPA susceptibility computed with Hartree energies. Thus exchange, which is contained in both the HF energies and the exchange term itself, was found to have a major effect on the susceptibility. It was found that the TDHF susceptibility has an absolute maximum at a nonzero value of q, indicating that when exchange effects are included in the susceptibility, the ground state of the uniform electron gas contains a spin density wave. {\textcopyright} 1980 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We have developed a new kind of multi-coefficient correlation method (MCCM) by empirically mixing correlated wave function methods and density functional methods. The new methods constitute a generalization of hybrid density functional theory and may be called multi-coefficient extrapolated density functional theory. Results by the new methods are compared to those obtained by G3SX, G3SX(MP3), CBS-Q and MCCM/3 for calculations of atomization energies, barrier heights, ionization potentials and electron affinities. These results show that the multi-coefficient extrapolated density functional theory is more accurate for thermochemistry and thermochemical kinetics than the pure wave function methods of comparable cost. As a byproduct of this work we optimized a new hybrid meta density functional theory called TPSS1KCIS, which has excellent performance for thermochemistry.},

We observe how these exhibit a significant tunability with charge carrier doping, leading to a polaronic liquid that is qualitatively distinct from its more conventional lattice-dominated analogue. Our study thus suggests powerful opportunities for tailoring quantum many-body interactions in solids via dilute charge carrier doping.},

abstract = {We describe and benchmark the quasi-four-component (Q4C) approach to relativistic density functional simulations of molecules and solids, using precise, numerically tabulated atom-centered orbital (NAO) basis sets to discretize Dirac's equation. The Q4C approach initially projects the atomic solution to (electron-only) positive-energy states and eventually deals with only two components but retains the precision of traditional four-component (4C) relativistic methods. While Q4C inherently reduces the dimension of the Hamiltonian matrix in diagonalization, the adoption of localized NAO basis functions in solids further limits the computational demand in real space operations, promising a pathway to investigate large and complex systems containing heavy elements with the precision of a 4C method. Here, we first perform validation and benchmark calculations for cohesive properties of a set of diatomic molecules and of previously established periodic model systems (i.e., silver halides). Then we report Q4C relativistic energy band structure benchmarks for a series of 103 periodic materials, including chemical elements up to Bi, and providing quantitative comparisons with more approximate scalar-relativistic and spin-orbit coupled treatments. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the method to band structure calculations of simple and complex hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites containing Pb and Bi, i.e., Cs2AgBiCl6 and a larger system (containing 94 atoms per unit cell), (4-FPEA)2PbI4. The effect of full Q4C, compared with scalar relativity, on binding energies can be significant even for relatively light p-orbital bonded main group elements such as Br and I - i.e., 0.3 and 0.6 eV for Br2 and I2 binding energies, respectively.},

When paired with an appropriate exchange functional, our nonlocal correlation model yields accurate interaction energies of weakly-bound complexes, not only near the energy minima but also far from equilibrium.

abstract = {We present explicitly correlated open-shell pair natural orbital local coupled-cluster methods, PNO-RCCSD(T)-F12 and PNO-UCCSD(T)-F12. The methods are extensions of our previously reported PNO-R/UCCSD methods (J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2020, 16, 3135-3151, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00192) with additions of explicit correlation and perturbative triples corrections. The explicit correlation treatment follows the spin-orbital CCSD-F12b theory using Ansatz 3*A, which is found to yield comparable or better basis set convergence than the more rigorous Ansatz 3C in computed ionization potentials and reaction energies using double-to quaduple-$\zeta$ basis sets. The perturbative triples correction is adapted from the spin-orbital (T) theory to use triples natural orbitals (TNOs). To address the coupling due to off-diagonal Fock matrix elements, the local triples amplitudes are iteratively solved using small domains of TNOs, and a semicanonical (T0) domain correction with larger domains is applied to reduce the domain errors. The performance of the methods is demonstrated through benchmark calculations on ionization potentials, radical stabilization energies, reaction energies of fragmentations and rearrangements in radical cations, and spin-state energy differences of iron complexes. For a few test sets where canonical calculations are feasible, PNO-RCCSD(T)-F12 results agree with the canonical ones to within 0.4 kcal mol-1, and this maximum error is reduced to below 0.2 kcal mol-1 when large local domains are used. For larger systems, results using different thresholds for the local approximations are compared to demonstrate that 1 kcal mol-1 level of accuracy can be achieved using our default settings. For a couple of difficult cases, it is demonstrated that the errors from individual approximations are only a fraction of 1 kcal mol-1, and the overall accuracy of the method does not rely on error compensations. In contrast to canonical calculations, the use of spin-orbitals does not lead to a significant increase of computational time and memory usage in the most expensive steps of PNO-R/UCCSD(T)-F12 calculations. The only exception is the iterative solution of the (T) amplitudes, which can be avoided without significant errors by using a perturbative treatment of the off-diagonal coupling, known as (T1) approximation. For most systems, even the semicanonical approximation (T0) leads only to small errors in relative energies. Our program is well parallelized and capable of computing accurate correlation energies for molecules with 100-200 atoms using augmented triple-$\zeta$ basis sets in less than a day of elapsed time on a small computer cluster.},

Our results show that the SCS variant consistently improves the results, while the SOS variant preserves the benefits of the original RS-DH method reducing its computational expenses.

Both results are very well predicted in the uncorrected case already with the smaller basis sets in the MP2/aug-cc-pVxZ series, whereas counterpoise correction completely fails to improve predictions mainly due to a wrong correction of the dynamic electron correlation contribution.

Thus, our optimized batching constitutes the best tradeoff between program runtime and memory demand. Within this batching scheme, the half-transformed three-center integral tensorBi$\mu$M is recomputed for each batch of auxiliary and basis functions. This allows the computation of systems that were out of reach before.

Tree tensor network states represent one of the simplest generalizations of matrix product states and the density matrix renormalization group. While matrix product states encode a one-dimensional entanglement structure, tree tensor network states encode a tree entanglement structure, allowing for a more flexible description of general molecules. We describe an optimal tree tensor network state algorithm for quantum chemistry. We introduce the concept of half-renormalization which greatly improves the efficiency of the calculations. Using our efficient formulation we demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of tree tensor network states versus matrix product states. We carry out benchmark calculations both on tree systems (hydrogen trees and $\pi$-conjugated dendrimers) as well as non-tree molecules (hydrogen chains, nitrogen dimer, and chromium dimer). In general, tree tensor network states require much fewer renormalized states to achieve the same accuracy as matrix product states. In non-tree molecules, whether this translates into a computational savings is system dependent, due to the higher prefactor and computational scaling associated with tree algorithms. In tree like molecules, tree network states are easily superior to matrix product states. As an illustration, our largest dendrimer calculation with tree tensor network states correlates 110 electrons in 110 active orbitals. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The GW approximation has been recently gaining popularity among the methods for simulating molecular core-level X-ray photoemission spectra. Traditionally, Gaussian-type orbital GW core-level binding energies have been computed using either the cc-pVnZ or def2-nZVP basis set families, extrapolating the obtained results to the complete basis set limit, followed by an element-specific relativistic correction. Despite achieving rather good accuracy, it has been previously stated that these binding energies are chronically underestimated. In the present work, we show that those previous studies obtained results that were not well-converged with respect to the basis set size and that, once basis set convergence is achieved, there seems to be no such underestimation. Standard techniques known to offer a good cost-accuracy ratio in other theories demonstrate that the cc-pVnZ and def2-nZVP families exhibit contraction errors and might lead to unreliable complete basis set extrapolations for absolute binding energies, often deviating about 200-500 meV from the putative basis set limit found in this work. On the other hand, uncontracted versions of these basis sets offer vastly improved convergence. Even faster convergence can be obtained using core-rich property-optimized basis set families like pcSseg-n, pcJ-n, and ccX-nZ. Finally, we also show that the improvement observed for core properties using these specialized basis sets does not degrade their description of valence excitations: vertical ionization potentials and electron affinities computed with these basis sets converge as fast as the ones obtained with the aug-cc-pVnZ family, thus offering a balanced description of both core and valence regions.},

Here, we develop and implement an Ab initio D$\Gamma$A approach (AbinitioD$\Gamma$A) for electronic structure calculations of materials. The starting point is the two-particle irreducible vertex in the two particle-hole channels which is approximated by the bare nonlocal Coulomb interaction and all local vertex corrections. From this, we calculate the full nonlocal vertex and the nonlocal self-energy through the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The AbinitioD$\Gamma$A approach naturally generates all local DMFT correlations and all nonlocal GW contributions, but also further nonlocal correlations beyond: mixed terms of the former two and nonlocal spin fluctuations. We apply this new methodology to the prototypical correlated metal SrVO3.},

abstract = {The development of new types of solar cells is driven by the need for clean and sustainable energy. In this respect dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) are considered as a promising route for departing from the traditional solid state cells. The physical insight provided by computational modeling may help develop improved DSCs. To this end, it is important to obtain an accurate description of the electronic structure, including the fundamental gaps and level alignment at the dye-TiO 2 interface. This requires a treatment beyond ground-state density functional theory (DFT). We present a many-body perturbation theory study, within the G 0W 0 approximation, of two of the crystalline phases of dye-sensitized TiO 2 clusters, reported by Benedict and Coppens,. We obtain geometries in good agreement with the experiment by using DFT with the Tkatchenko-Scheffler van der Waals correction. We demonstrate that even when DFT gives a good description of the valence spectrum and a qualitatively correct picture of the electronic structure of the dye-TiO 2 interface, G 0W 0 calculations yield more valuable quantitative information regarding the fundamental gaps and level alignment. In addition, we systematically investigate the issues pertaining to G 0W 0 calculations, namely: (i) convergence with respect to the number of basis functions, (ii) dependence on the mean-field starting point, and (iii) the validity of the assumption that the DFT wave function is a good approximation to the quasiparticle wave function. We show how these issues are manifested for dye molecules and for dye-sensitized TiO 2 clusters. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

We review the approximations and parameters that control the accuracy of G0W0 results in each code, and we discuss in detail the effect of extrapolation techniques for the parameters entering the WEST code. Differences between the VIP and VEA computed with the various codes are within ∼60 and ∼120 meV, respectively, which is up to four times larger than in the case of the best results obtained with DFT codes. Vertical ionization potentials are validated against experiment and CCSD(T) quantum chemistry results showing a mean absolute relative error of ∼4{\%} for data obtained with WEST. Our analysis of the differences between localized orbitals and plane-wave implementations points out molecules containing Cu, I, Ga, and Xe as major sources of discrepancies, which call for a re-evaluation of the pseudopotentials used for these systems in G0W0 calculations.},

abstract = {For a set of eight equilibrium intermolecular complexes, it is discovered that the basis set limit (BSL) cannot be reached by aug-cc-pV5Z for three of the Minnesota density functionals: M06-L, M06-HF, and M11-L. In addition, the M06 and M11 functionals exhibit substantial, but less severe, difficulties in reaching the BSL. By using successively finer grids, it is demonstrated that this issue is not related to the numerical integration of the exchange-correlation functional. In addition, it is shown that the difficulty in reaching the BSL is not a direct consequence of the structure of the augmented functions in Dunning's basis sets, since modified augmentation yields similar results. By using a very large custom basis set, the BSL appears to be reached for the HF dimer for all of the functionals. As a result, it is concluded that the difficulties faced by several of the Minnesota density functionals are related to an interplay between the form of these functionals and the structure of standard basis sets. It is speculated that the difficulty in reaching the basis set limit is related to the magnitude of the inhomogeneity correction factor (ICF) of the exchange functional. A simple modification of the M06-L exchange functional that systematically reduces the basis set superposition error (BSSE) for the HF dimer in the aug-cc-pVQZ basis set is presented, further supporting the speculation that the difficulty in reaching the BSL is caused by the magnitude of the exchange functional ICF. Finally, the BSSE is plotted with respect to the internuclear distance of the neon dimer for two of the examined functionals. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Analytic continuation of numerical data obtained in imaginary time or frequency has become an essential part of many branches of quantum computational physics. It is, however, an ill-conditioned procedure and thus a hard numerical problem. The maximum-entropy approach, based on Bayesian inference, is the most widely used method to tackle that problem. Although the approach is well established and among the most reliable and efficient ones, useful developments of the method and of its implementation are still possible. In addition, while a few free software implementations are available, a well-documented, optimized, general purpose, and user-friendly software dedicated to that specific task is still lacking. Here we analyze all aspects of the implementation that are critical for accuracy and speed and present a highly optimized approach to maximum entropy. Original algorithmic and conceptual contributions include (1) numerical approximations that yield a computational complexity that is almost independent of temperature and spectrum shape (including sharp Drude peaks in broad background, for example) while ensuring quantitative accuracy of the result whenever precision of the data is sufficient, (2) a robust method of choosing the entropy weight $\alpha$ that follows from a simple consistency condition of the approach and the observation that information- and noise-fitting regimes can be identified clearly from the behavior of $\chi$2 with respect to $\alpha$, and (3) several diagnostics to assess the reliability of the result. Benchmarks with test spectral functions of different complexity and an example with an actual physical simulation are presented. Our implementation, which covers most typical cases for fermions, bosons, and response functions, is available as an open source, user-friendly software.},

abstract = {This review paper describes the basic concept and technical details of sparse modeling and its applications to quantum many-body problems. Sparse modeling refers to methodologies for finding a small number of relevant parameters that well explain a given dataset. This concept reminds us physics, where the goal is to find a small number of physical laws that are hidden behind complicated phenomena. Sparse modeling extends the target of physics from natural phenomena to data, and may be interpreted as “physics for data”. The first half of this review introduces sparse modeling for physicists. It is assumed that readers have physics background but no expertise in data science. The second half reviews applications. Matsubara Green's function, which plays a central role in descriptions of correlated systems, has been found to be sparse, meaning that it contains little information. This leads to (i) a new method for solving the ill-conditioned inverse problem for analytical continuation, and (ii) a highly compact representation of Matsubara Green's function, which enables efficient calculations for quantum many-body systems.},

abstract = {We show that a rigid scissors-like GW self-consistency approach, labeled here $\Delta$̄GW0, can be trivially implemented at zero additional cost for large scale one-shot G0W0 calculations. The method significantly improves one-shot G0W0 and for large systems is very accurate. $\Delta$̄GW0 is similar in spirit to evGW0 where the self-consistency is only applied on the eigenvalues entering Green's function, while both W and the eigenvectors of Green's function are held fixed. $\Delta$̄GW0 further assumes that the shift of the eigenvalues is rigid scissors-like so that all occupied states are shifted by the same amount and analogously for all the unoccupied states. We show that this results in a trivial modification of the time-dependent G0W0 self-energy, enabling an a posteriori self-consistency cycle. The method is applicable for our recent stochastic-GW approach, thereby enabling self-consistent calculations for giant systems with thousands of electrons. The accuracy of $\Delta$̄GW0 increases with the system size. For molecules, it is up to 0.4-0.5 eV away from coupled-cluster single double triple (CCSD(T)), but for tetracene and hexacene, it matches the ionization energies from both CCSD(T) and evGW0 to better than 0.05 eV. For solids, as exemplified here by periodic supercells of semiconductors and insulators with 6192 valence electrons, the method matches evGW0 quite well and both methods are in good agreement with the experiment.},

abstract = {Using second-order many-body perturbation theory [MBPT(2)] and the gauge-including atomic orbital (GIAO) ansatz, electron correlation effects are investigated in the calculation of NMR chemical shieldings and shifts. A thorough discussion of the theory, aspects of the implementation as well as the computational requirements of the GIAO-MBPT(2) method are presented. The performance of the GIAO-MBPT(2) approach is tested in benchmark calculations of 13C, 15N, and 17O chemical shifts. Comparison with available experimental gas phase NMR data shows that GIAO-MBPT(2) improves in all cases considered here over the GIAO results obtained at the Hartree–Fock self-consistent-field (HF-SCF) level. Correlation effects turn out to be particularly important for molecules with multiple bonds, e.g., carbonyl or cyano compounds, and it seems that GIAO-MBPT(2) slightly overestimates these effects for difficult cases having relatively large correlation contributions of 30 to 110 ppm. For CO, N2, N2O, additional calculations with large basis sets are presented to check the accuracy of the GIAO-MBPT(2) method and the geometry dependence of the calculated chemical shieldings is analyzed.},

abstract = {Light absorption of myoglobin triggers diatomic ligand photolysis and a spin crossover transition of iron(II) that initiate protein conformational change. The photolysis and spin crossover reactions happen concurrently on a femtosecond timescale. The microscopic origin of these reactions remains controversial. Here, we apply quantum wavepacket dynamics to elucidate the ultrafast photochemical mechanism for a heme–carbon monoxide (heme–CO) complex. We observe coherent oscillations of the Fe–CO bond distance with a period of 42 fs and an amplitude of ∼1 {\AA}. These nuclear motions induce pronounced geometric reorganization, which makes the CO dissociation irreversible. The reaction is initially dominated by symmetry breaking vibrations inducing an electron transfer from porphyrin to iron. Subsequently, the wavepacket relaxes to the triplet manifold in ∼75 fs and to the quintet manifold in ∼430 fs. Our results highlight the central role of nuclear vibrations at the origin of the ultrafast photodynamics of organometallic complexes.},

abstract = {A prerequisite to characterize magnetic materials is the capability to describe systems containing unpaired electrons. In this study, we benchmark the one-shot GW (G0 W0) on top of different unrestricted mean-field solutions for open-shell molecules using Dunning's correlation-consistent basis sets expanded in terms of Gaussian functions. We find that the G0 W0 correction to hybrid functionals provides reasonably accurate results for the ionization energies of open-shell systems when compared to those obtained from high-level ab initio methods. Moreover, the quality of the G0 W0 exchange-correlation approximation is evaluated by the discrepancy between the ionization energy of the neutral molecules and the electron affinity of the corresponding cations. Furthermore, we assess the capability of the GW to reproduce the correct energy ordering of molecular spin-orbitals. To such an aim, we thoroughly discuss three open-shell molecules CN, NH2, and O2, for which approximate functionals fail to correctly capture the single-electron spectrum. Particularly, we demonstrate that the overestimation of the exchange energy in the studied spin-orbitals is reduced by the GW dynamic correlation term, restoring the molecular orbital ordering. Interestingly, we find that deviations of the exchange and correlation energies, in comparison with our ab initio reference, can be very different for molecular orbitals with different symmetry, e.g. $\sigma$ and $\pi$-type orbitals.},

abstract = {Excited states of donor-acceptor dimers are studied using many-body Green's functions theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. For a series of prototypical small-molecule based pairs, this method predicts energies of local Frenkel and intermolecular charge-transfer excitations with the accuracy of tens of meV. Application to larger systems is possible and allowed us to analyze energy levels and binding energies of excitons in representative dimers of dicyanovinyl-substituted quarterthiophene and fullerene, a donor-acceptor pair used in state of the art organic solar cells. In these dimers, the transition from Frenkel to charge transfer excitons is endothermic and the binding energy of charge transfer excitons is still of the order of 1.5-2 eV. Hence, even such an accurate dimer-based description does not yield internal energetics favorable for the generation of free charges either by thermal energy or an external electric field. These results confirm that, for qualitative predictions of solar cell functionality, accounting for the explicit molecular environment is as important as the accurate knowledge of internal dimer energies. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

It is shown that the G0 W0 approximation always yields too small band gaps. To improve agreement with experiment, the eigenvalues in the Green's function G (G W0) and in the Green's function and the dielectric matrix (GW) are updated until self-consistency is reached. The first approximation leads to excellent agreement with experiment, whereas an update of the eigenvalues in G and W gives too large band gaps for virtually all materials. From a pragmatic point of view, the G W0 approximation thus seems to be an accurate and still reasonably fast method for predicting quasiparticle energies in simple sp -bonded systems. We furthermore observe that the band gaps in materials with shallow d states (GaAs, GaN, and ZnO) are systematically underestimated. We propose that an inaccurate description of the static dielectric properties of these materials is responsible for the underestimation of the band gaps in G W0, which is itself a result of the incomplete cancellation of the Hartree self-energy within the d shell by local or gradient corrected density functionals. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In little more than 20 years, the number of applications of the density functional (DF) formalism in chemistry and materials science has grown in an astonishing fashion. The number of publications alone shows that DF calculations make up a huge success story, and many younger colleagues are surprised to learn that the widespread application of density functional methods, particularly in chemistry, began only after 1990. This is indeed unexpected, because the origins are usually traced to the papers of Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham more than a quarter of a century earlier. The DF formalism, its applications, and prospects were reviewed for this journal in 1989. About the same time, the combination of DF calculations with molecular dynamics promised to provide an efficient way to study structures and reactions in molecules and extended systems. This paper reviews the development of density-related methods back to the early years of quantum mechanics and follows the breakthrough in their application after 1990. The two examples from biochemistry and materials science are among the many current applications that were simply far beyond expectations in 1990. The reasons why - 50 years after its modern formulation and after two decades of rapid expansion - some of the most cited practitioners in the field are concerned about its future are discussed.},

The design of the library is focused on a systematically optimal computing strategy to improve its scalability and efficiency. The performance of the library is demonstrated by the relevant profiling analysis of running GFCC calculations on remote giant computing clusters.

In turn, the correlation energy, defined as an integral over the density-density response function, gives improved binding energies without the need for error cancellation. Here, we demonstrate that these features are crucial for predicting the relative energies between low- and high-pressure polymorphs of different coordination number as, e.g., between $\alpha$-quartz and stishovite in SiO2, and layered and cubic BN. Furthermore, a reliable (H2O)2 potential energy surface is obtained, necessary for describing the various phases of ice.

We also calculated enthalpies of formation of the standard G2-1 set of 55 molecules and found that self-interaction-correction (SIC) improves agreement with experiment only for the LSDA functional, while all other functionals show worse performance upon introducing SIC. This is the first systematic study of the effect of SIC on thermochemical properties. We found no direct connection between the magnitude of the SIE contained in a functional and its performance for thermochemistry.

abstract = {We present a benchmark study of gas phase geometry optimizations in the excited states of carbon monoxide, acetone, acrolein, and methylenecyclopropene using many-body Green's functions theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) employing numerical gradients. We scrutinize the influence of several typical approximations in the GW-BSE framework; we used one-shot G0W0 or eigenvalue self-consistent evGW, employing a fully analytic approach or plasmon-pole model for the frequency dependence of the electron self-energy, or performing the BSE step within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation. The obtained geometries are compared to reference results from multireference perturbation theory (CASPT2), variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, second-order approximate coupled cluster (CC2) method, and time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT). We find overall a good agreement of the structural parameters optimized with the GW-BSE calculations with CASPT2, with an average relative error of around 1{\%} for the G0W0 and 1.5{\%} for the evGW variants based on a PBE0 ground state, respectively, while the other approximations have negligible influence. The relative errors are also smaller than those for CC2 and TDDFT with different functionals and only larger than VMC, indicating that the GW-BSE method does not only yield excitation energies but also geometries in good agreement with established higher-order wave function methods.},

@article{Chan2018,
abstract = {In the present study, we have examined in detail literature data of deviations for a wide range of (mainly) DFT methods for the extensive MGCDB82 set (∼4400 data points) of main-group thermochemical quantities. We use the data and standard statistical techniques (lasso regularization and forward selection) to devise the MG8 model for linearly combining assessment results of a collection of small data sets to accurately estimate the MAD of MGCDB82. The MG8 model contains a total of 64 data points representing noncovalent interactions, isomerization energies, thermochemical properties, and barrier heights. It is thus well suited for rapid evaluation of new quantum chemistry procedures. We propose that a value of ∼4 kJ mol −1 for an estimated MAD by the MG8 model (EMAD MG8) to be an initial indicator of a highly robust quantum chemistry method, with large deviations occurring mainly for properties (such as heats of formation) that are known to be difficult to accurately compute. For methods with larger EMADs, we emphasize the importance of more thorough testing, as these methods are likely to have a larger number of outliers, and it may be less trivial to anticipate circumstances under which large deviations occur. In relation to this aspect, we have applied the same generally applicable statistical techniques to further formulate small-data-set models for assessing the accuracy for some properties that are not covered by MG8 nor by MGCDB82. They include the MOR13 model for metal−organic reactions, the SBG5 model for semiconductor band gaps, and MB13 for stress-testing methods with artificial species. ■ INTRODUCTION The development of low-cost yet adequately accurate quantum chemistry methodologies, notably density functional theory (DFT) methods, 1 has come a long way in recent decades. Lately, their formulation relies quite heavily on fitting to and/ or testing with large sets of benchmark data. 2−6 During the early days of this trend, moderately sized data sets such as G2 7,8 have been used, for example, for the optimization of the B97 functional, 9 on which many modern DFT methods are based. This set of thermochemical quantities contains roughly 150 data points. The size of typical test sets has grown since then. Very recently, Mardirossian and Head-Gordon have compiled the MGCDB84 data set for main-group chemistry, 10 and it astonishingly comprises nearly 5000 data points! Likewise, the recently introduced GMTKN55 set 11 contains approximately 1500 thermochemical quantities for main-group molecular species. This is still very substantial even though it is relatively modest when compared with MGCDB84. The availability of these extensive data sets has on the one hand provided developers of DFT and other approximate methods an excellent means for thorough testing and tuning of their methods. On the other hand, when one is at an early stage of formulating a new procedure, it would be advantageous to explore a wide range of methodological directions in a more efficient manner. Thus, a common practice is to use a smaller training set for development purpose and then test the resulting method with a larger test set. However, even the size of training sets has grown substantially. For instance, the newly developed $\omega$B97M-V 6 functional was initially trained with a subset of MGCDB84 that already contains close to 900 data points, before eventually being tested on the full set of nearly 5000 benchmark values. In our own development of new quantum chemistry procedures, including both DFT methods 12−16 as well as high-level composite protocols, 17−23 we typically use smaller training sets such as the E2 18,19 and E3 24−26 sets that we compiled. It is thus of interest to us, and we believe also to other developers, to evaluate whether one can construct models of small data sets to represent larger ones. Indeed, some of the widely used small data sets (e.g., AE6 27 and DBH24 28) are derived from larger parent sets. Whether one can substantially downsize very large sets such as MGCDB84 and GMTKN55 without compromising the utility, however, remains an open question. In the present study, we attempt to use the results related to MGCDB84 to devise smaller and generally applicable data sets, with the hope of facilitating the development of new methodologies in a timely fashion. ■ COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS Standard computational chemistry calculations were carried out with Gaussian 16 29 and Q-Chem 5.0. 30 Corrections for},

We go beyond the conventional QSGW method by including the spin-orbit coupling throughout the self-consistency cycle. This approach improves the description of the electron and the hole pockets considerably with respect to standard density functional theory (DFT), leading to excellent agreement with experiment. We employ this relativistic QSGW approach to conduct a study of the semimetal-to-semiconductor and the trivial-to-topological transitions that Bi experiences under strain. DFT predicts that an unphysically large strain is needed for such transitions. We show, by means of the relativistic QSGW description of the electronic structure, that an in-plane tensile strain of only 0.3{\%} and a compressive strain of 0.4{\%} are sufficient to cause the semimetal-to-semiconductor and the trivial-to-topological phase transitions, respectively. Thus, the required strain moves into a regime that is likely to be realizable in experiment, which opens up the possibility to explore bulklike topological behavior of pure Bi.},

abstract = {A brief review of our linear-scaling method for atomic-orbital (AO) second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) is given. The key feature of our method is the rigorous preselection of numerically significant four-center two-electron integrals based on multipole-based integral estimates (MBIE) that do not only account for the exponential coupling between the Gaussian-type basis functions forming charge distributions, but also for the 1/R coupling between the charge distributions. This coupling turns for the required integral products in AO-MP2 into at least a 1/R4or even a 1/R 6decay behavior. Using MBIE we attain linear scaling, which is illustrated for DNA fragments with up to 1052 atoms and 10 674 basis functions as computed on a single processor. The largest molecule calculated in our present work at the scaled-opposite spin (SOS-) AO-MP2 level is an RNA system comprising 1664 atoms and 19 182 basis functions. Furthermore, we present results for the use of Cholesky-decomposed pseudo-density matrices in Laplace-based MP2, that offers the advantage of exploiting occupied/virtual blocking both with and without auxiliary basis sets. {\textcopyright} by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, M{\"{u}}nchen.},

In an effort to systematically assess the influence of several correlation energy contributions beyond RPA, this paper presents dissociation energies of small molecules and solids, activation energies for hydrogen transfer and non-hydrogen transfer reactions, as well as reaction energies for a number of common test sets. We benchmark EX + RPA and several flavors of energy functionals going beyond it: second-order screened exchange (SOSEX), single-excitation (SE) corrections, renormalized singleexcitation (rSE) corrections and their combinations. Both the SE correction and the SOSEX contribution to the correlation energy significantly improve on the notorious tendency of EX + RPA to underbind. Surprisingly, activation energies obtained using EX + RPA based on a KS reference alone are remarkably accurate. RPA+ SOSEX + rSE provides an equal level of accuracy for reaction as well as activation energies and overall gives the most balanced performance, because of which it can be applied to a wide range of systems and chemical reactions. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract = {The direct random phase approximation (dRPA) combined with Kohn-Sham reference orbitals is among the most promising tools in computational chemistry and applicable in many areas of chemistry and physics. The reason for this is that it scales as N4 with the system size, which is a considerable advantage over the accurate ab initio wave function methods like standard coupled-cluster. dRPA also yields a considerably more accurate description of thermodynamic and electronic properties than standard density-functional theory methods. It is also able to describe strong static electron correlation effects even in large systems with a small or vanishing band gap missed by common single-reference methods. However, dRPA has several flaws due to its self-correlation error. In order to obtain accurate and precise reaction energies, barriers and noncovalent intra- and intermolecular interactions, we construct a new dual-hybrid dRPA (hybridization of exact and semilocal exchange in both the energy and the orbitals) and test the performance of this new functional on isogyric, isodesmic, hypohomodesmotic, homodesmotic, and hyperhomodesmotic reaction classes. We also use a test set of 14 Diels-Alder reactions, six atomization energies (AE6), 38 hydrocarbon atomization energies, and 100 reaction barrier heights (DBH24, HT-BH38, and NHT-BH38). For noncovalent complexes, we use the NCCE31 and S22 test sets. To test the intramolecular interactions, we use a set of alkane, cysteine, phenylalanine-glycine-glycine tripeptide, and monosaccharide conformers. We also discuss the delocalization and static correlation errors. We show that a universally accurate description of chemical properties can be provided by a large, 75{\%} exact exchange mixing both in the calculation of the reference orbitals and the final energy.},

In addition, we have employed a range of many-body methods; including G0W0, qsGW, EA/IP-EOM-CCSD, and DFT (B3LYP, PBE), to compare the performance and predictions of the different classes of methods. We demonstrate that, for bare clusters, all many-body methods predict the same trend with cluster size. The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied DFT orbitals follow the same trends as the electron affinity and ionization potentials predicted by the many-body methods, but are generally far too shallow and deep respectively in absolute terms. In contrast, the $\Delta$DFT method is found to yield values in the correct energy window. However, its predictions depend upon the functional used and do not necessarily follow trends based on the many-body methods. Adiabatic potentials are predicted to be similar to their vertical counterparts and holes found to be trapped more strongly than excess electrons. The effect of hydroxylation on the clusters is to open up both the optical and fundamental gap. Finally, a simple microscopic explanation for the observed trends with cluster size and upon hydroxylation is proposed in terms of the onsite electrostatic potential.},

These are the minimum image convention (MIC) and the truncated Coulomb interaction (TCI) that we use here in combination with k-meshes. We observe artifacts in four-center integrals of GTOs, when evaluated in the TCI scheme. They carry over to the exchange and density matrices of Hartree-Fock calculations for TCI but are absent in MIC. At semiconducting and insulating systems, we show that both MIC and TCI yield the same energies for a sufficiently large supercell or k-mesh, but the self-consistent field algorithm is more stable for MIC. We therefore conclude that the MIC is superior to TCI and validate our implementation by comparing not only to other GTO-based calculations but also by demonstrating excellent agreement with results of plane-wave codes for sufficiently large Gaussian basis sets.},

abstract = {The nonrelativistic Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation is supposed to yield a pairwise R-6 attractive interaction among atoms or molecules for large separation, R. Up to now this attraction has been investigated only in perturbation theory or else by invoking various assumptions and approximations. We show rigorously that the attraction is at least as strong as R-6 for any shapes of the molecules, independent of other features such as statistics or sign of charge of the particles. More precisely, we prove that two neutral molecules can always be oriented such that the ground-state energy of the combined system is less than the sum of the ground-state energies of the isolated molecules by a term - cR-6 provided R is larger than the sum of the diameters of the molecules. When several molecules are present, a pairwise bound of this kind is, derived. In short, we prove that in the quantum mechanics of Coulomb Systems everything binds to everything else if the nuclear motion is neglected. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York.},

abstract = {We investigated the electronic structure of the photosystem II reaction center (PSII RC) in relation to the light-induced charge separation process using Stark spectroscopy on a series of site-directed PSII RC mutants from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The site-directed mutations modify the protein environment of the cofactors involved in charge separation (P D1, PD2, ChlD1, and PheD1). The results demonstrate that at least two different exciton states are mixed with charge-transfer (CT) states, yielding exciton states with CT character: (P D2$\delta$+PD1$\delta$-ChlD1)673nm and (ChlD1$\delta$+PheD1$\delta$-)681nm (where the subscript indicates the wavelength of the electronic transition). Moreover, the CT state PD2+PD1- acquires excited-state character due to its mixing with an exciton state, producing (PD2+P D1-)$\delta$684nm. We conclude that the states that initiate charge separation are mixed exciton-CT states, and that the degree of mixing between exciton and CT states determines the efficiency of charge separation. In addition, the results reveal that the pigment-protein interactions fine-tune the energy of the exciton and CT states, and hence the mixing between these states. This mixing ultimately controls the selection and efficiency of a specific charge separation pathway, and highlights the capacity of the protein environment to control the functionality of the PSII RC complex. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Many-body perturbation theory within the GW approach has been established as a quantitatively accurate approach for predicting the quasiparticle and excited-state properties of a wide variety of materials. However, the successful application of the method is often complicated by the computational complexity associated with the evaluation and inversion of the frequency-dependent dielectric matrix ($\omega$). Here, we describe an approach to speed up the evaluation of the frequency-dependent part of ($\omega$) in the traditional sum-over-states GW framework based on the low-rank approximation of the static dielectric matrix, a technique often used in GW implementations that are based on a starting mean field within density-functional perturbation theory. We show that the overall accuracy of the approach, independently from other calculation parameters, is solely determined by the threshold on the eigenvalues of the static dielectric matrix, ($\omega$=0), and that it can yield orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in full-frequency GW calculations. We validate our implementation with several benchmark calculations ranging from bulk materials to systems with reduced dimensionality, and show that this technique allows one not only to study larger systems, but also to carefully consider the convergence of computationally demanding systems, such as ZnO, without relying on plasmon-pole models.},

abstract = {Testing of the spin-component scaled second-order Moller-Plesset (SCS-MP2) method for the computation of noncovalent interaction energies is done with a database of 165 biologically relevant complexes. The effects of the spin-scaling procedure (i.e., MP2 vs SCS-MP2), the basis set size, and the corrections for basis set superposition error (BSSE) are systematically examined. When using two-point basis set extrapolations for the correlation energy, augmentation of the atomic orbital basis with computationally costly diffuse functions is found to be obsolete. In general, SCS-MP2 also improves results for noncovalent interactions statistically on MP2, and significant outliers are removed. Moreover, it is shown that effects of BSSE and one-particle basis set incompleteness almost cancel each other in the case of triple-zeta sets (SCS-MP2/TZVPP or SCS-MP2/cc-pVTZ without counterpoise correction), which opens a practical route to efficient computations for large systems. We recommend SCS-MP2 as the preferred quantum chemical wave function based method for the noncovalent interactions in large biologically relevant systems when reasonable coupled-cluster with single and double and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)) calculations cannot be performed anymore. A comparison to MP2 and CCSD(T) interaction energies for n-alkane dimers, however, indicates (and this also holds to a lesser extent for hydrogen-bonded systems) limitations of SCS-MP2 when treating chemically "saturated" interactions. The different behavior of second-order perturbation theory for saturated and for stacked pi-systems is discussed.},

A realistic and consistent LCAO-MO $\pi$-electron theory should allow the $\sigma$-electrons to adjust themselves to the instantaneous positions of the mobile $\pi$-electrons. This is accomplished in the theory by assignment of empirical values to the Coulomb electronic repulsion integrals and Coulomb penetration integrals which enter the formulas, these values being obtained in a prescribed way from valence state ionization potentials and electron affinities of atoms. Use of the empirical values in the molecular orbital theory reduces the magnitude of computed singlet-triplet splittings and the effects of configuration interaction without complicating the mathematics. From the valence-bond point of view, ionic structures may be said to be enhanced. The applications to hydrocarbons and heteromolecules which are considered show that the theory can correlate known ±-electron spectral wavelengths and intensities very successfully, which, together with the simple structure of the theory, signals that manifold applications of the theory are in order elsewhere.},

Accurate reaction energies are obtained at the complete basis-set limit CCSD(T) level by means of the high-level W1-F12 thermochemical protocol. The isomerisation reactions involve a migration of one double bond that breaks the conjugated $\pi$ -system. The considered enecarbonyls involve a range of common functional groups (e.g., Me, NH 2 , OMe, F, and CN). Apart from $\pi$ -conjugation effects, the chemical environments are largely conserved on the two sides of the reactions and therefore the EIE22 data-set allows us to assess the performance of a variety of density functional theory (DFT) procedures for the calculation of $\pi$ -conjugation stabilisation energies in enecarbonyls. We find that, with few exceptions (M05-2X, M06-2X, BMK, and BH{\&}HLYP), all the conventional DFT procedures attain root mean square deviations (RMSDs) between 5.0 and 11.7 kJ mol −1 .

abstract = {We review the basics and the evolution of a powerful and widely applicable general approach to the systematic reduction of computational burden in many-electron calculations. Variational fitting of electron densities (either total or partial) has the great advantage, for quantum mechanical calculations, that it respects the stationarity property, which is at the heart of the success of the basis set expansion methods ubiquitous in computational chemistry and materials physics. The key point is easy. In a finite system, independent of whether the fitted charge distribution is constrained to contain the proper amount of charge, variational fitting guarantees that the quantum mechanical total energy retains the stationarity property. Thus, many-electron quantum mechanics with variational fitting of an electronic density in an incomplete density-fitting basis set behaves similarly as the exact quantum mechanical energy does when evaluated with an incomplete basis set to fit wavefunctions or spin-orbitals. Periodically bounded systems are a bit more subtle but the essential stationarity is preserved. This preservation of an exact property is quite distinct from truncation of the resolution of the identity in a basis. Variational fitting has proven to have benefits far beyond the original objective of making a Gaussian-orbital basis calculation of an early density functional computationally feasible. We survey many of those developments briefly, with guidance to the pertinent literature and a few remarks about the connections with Quantum Theory Project. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Here we present a systematic study on the performance of different GW approaches: G0W0, G0W0 with linearized quasiparticle equation (lin-G0W0), and quasiparticle self-consistent GW (qsGW), in predicting core level binding energies (CLBEs) on a series of representative molecules comparing to Kohn-Sham (KS) orbital energy-based results. KS orbital energies obtained using the PBE functional are 20-30 eV lower in energy than experimental values obtained from X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), showing that any Koopmans-like interpretation of KS core level orbitals fails dramatically. Results from qsGW lead to CLBEs that are closer to experimental values from XPS, yet too large. For the qsGW method, the mean absolute error is about 2 eV, an order of magnitude better than plain KS PBE orbital energies and quite close to predictions from ?SCF calculations with the same functional, which are accurate within ∼1 eV. Smaller errors of ∼0.6 eV are found for qsGW CLBE shifts, again similar to those obtained using ?SCF PBE. The computationally more affordable G0W0 approximation leads to results less accurate than qsGW, with an error of ∼9 eV for CLBEs and ∼0.9 eV for their shifts. Interestingly, starting G0W0 from PBE0 reduces this error to ∼4 eV with a slight improvement on the shifts as well (∼0.4 eV). The validity of the G0W0 results is however questionable since only linearized quasiparticle equation results can be obtained. The present results pave the way to estimate CLBEs in periodic systems where ?SCF calculations are not straightforward although further improvement is clearly needed.},

abstract = {To what extent does Noether's principle apply to quantum channels? Here, we quantify the degree to which imposing a symmetry constraint on quantum channels implies a conservation law, and show that this relates to physically impossible transformations in quantum theory, such as time-reversal and spin-inversion. In this analysis, the convex structure and extremal points of the set of quantum channels symmetric under the action of a Lie group G becomes essential. It allows us to derive bounds on the deviation from conservation laws under any symmetric quantum channel in terms of the deviation from closed dynamics as measured by the unitarity of the channel. In particular, we investigate in detail the U(1) and SU(2) symmetries related to energy and angular momentum conservation laws. In the latter case, we provide fundamental limits on how much a spin-jA system can be used to polarise a larger spin-jB system, and on how much one can invert spin polarisation using a rotationally-symmetric operation. Finally, we also establish novel links between unitarity, complementary channels and purity that are of independent interest.},

Three approximations to the electronic self-energy are considered: G0W0, G0W0tc, and G0W0tc$\Delta$X. All three methods are formulated in the time domain, and the latter two incorporate nonlocal vertex corrections. In the case of G0W0tc$\Delta$X, the vertex corrections are included both in the screened Coulomb interaction and in the expression for the self-energy. The implementation of the three approximations is verified by comparison to deterministic results for a set of small molecules. The performance of the fully stochastic implementation is tested on acene molecules, C60 and PC60BM. The vertex correction appears crucial for the description of unoccupied states. Unlike conventional (deterministic) approaches, all three stochastic methods scale linearly with the number of electrons.},

Here, we propose a simple scheme for reliable calculations of vertical ionization and attachment energies, as well as of redox potentials of solvated molecules. The approach exploits linear response approximation in the context of explicit solvent simulations with spherical boundary conditions. It is shown that both vertical ionization energies and vertical electron affinities, and, consequently redox potentials, exhibit linear dependence on the inverse radius of the solvation sphere. The explanation of the linear dependence is provided, and an extrapolation scheme is suggested. The proposed approach accounts for the specific short-range interactions within hybrid DFT and effective fragment potential approach as well as for the asymptotic system-size effects. The computed vertical ionization energies and redox potentials are in excellent agreement with the experimental values.},

abstract = {The development of van der Waals density functional approximations (vdW-DFAs) has gained considerable interest over the past decade. While in a strictest sense, energy calculations with vdW-DFAs should be carried out fully self-consistently, we demonstrate conclusively for a total of 11 methods that such a strategy only increases the computational time effort without having any significant effect on energetic properties, electron densities, or orbital-energy differences. The strategy to apply a nonlocal vdW-DFA kernel as an additive correction to a fully converged conventional DFA result is therefore justified and more efficient. As part of our study, we utilize the extensive GMTKN55 database for general main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2017, 19, 32184], which allows us to analyze the very promising B97M-V [J. Chem. Phys. 2015, 142, 074111] and $\omega$B97M-V [J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 144, 214110] DFAs. We also present new DFT-D3(BJ) based counterparts of these two methods and of $\omega$B97X-V [J. Chem. Theory Comput 2013, 9, 263], which are faster variants with similar accuracy.

With the aid of a Laplace transform, the usual sum-of-integral expressions of the second-order self-energy in many-body Greens function theory are rewritten into a sum of just four 13-dimensional integrals, 12-dimensional parts of which are evaluated by Monte Carlo integration. Efficient importance sampling is achieved with the Metropolis algorithm and a 12-dimensional weight function that is analytically integrable, is positive everywhere, and cancels all the singularities in the integrands exactly and analytically. The quasiparticle energies of small molecules have been reproduced within a few mEh of the correct values with 108 Monte Carlo steps.

Post-CCSD(T) contributions were considered and found to be unimportant. The data thus obtained were used to assess the performance of a variety of density functional methods. Double-hybrid functionals like B2GP-PLYP and B2K-PLYP, especially with a small Grimme-type empirical dispersion correction, are capable of rendering conformational energies of CCSD(T) quality. These were used as a "secondary standard" for a larger sample of alkanes, including isopentane and the branched hexanes as well as key isomers of heptane and octane. Popular DFT functionals like B3LYP, B3PW91, BLYP, PBE, and PBE0 tend to overestimate conformer energies without dispersion correction, while the M06 family severely underestimates GG interaction energies. Grimme-type dispersion corrections for these overcorrect and lead to qualitatively wrong conformer orderings. All of these functionals also exhibit deficiencies in the conformer geometries, particularly the backbone torsion angles. The PW6B95 and, to a lesser extent, BMK functionals are relatively free of these deficiencies. Performance of these methods is further investigated for conformer ensemble corrections to the enthalpy function, H298 - H0, and the Gibbs energy function, gef(T) = -[G(T) - H0]/T, of these alkanes. While H298 - H0 is only moderately sensitive to the level of theory, gef(T) exhibits more pronounced sensitivity.},

abstract = {The fluctuation-exchange, or FLEX, approximation for interacting electrons is derived for lattice Hamiltonians with general instantaneous one- and two-body terms. The use of a two-body basis set indexed by relative separation, rather than relative momentum, is emphasized. The fluctuation-exchange approximation for the three-orbital (Formula presented) model with on-site and near-neighbor Coulomb interactions is solved for one-particle properties. Unit-cell densities corresponding to both "hole doping" and "electron doping" are studied. The model is found to be far from a charge-density instability for all reasonable parameter values. The only nearly unstable particle-hole channel for unit-cell densities close to unity has Q∼($\pi$,$\pi$) and S=1 (antiferromagnetic). The Fermi surface of the interacting system is computed, and the Luttinger theorem verified numerically in its most general context. Orbital-projected occupancy factors and spectral densities are examined. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

The first approach provides individual corrections to the CIS excitation energies while the second one represents a different strategy which introduces perturbative corrections to the CIS matrix elements. It is shown that the second approach, which belongs to the less common perturb-then-diagonalize category, has several important advantages over the first one. One of the main problems of the traditionally formulated perturbation expansion is the presence of irreducible disconnected contributions which shows that the method is size-inextensive. The problem can be solved only by imposing additional approximations. It is shown that the perturb-then-diagonalize formulation provides all desirable features required in excitation energy calculations in a natural way and thus seems better suited for this kind of calculation.},

abstract = {We present a fully relativistic extension of the optimized-potential method (ROPM), including the transverse electron-electron interaction and vacuum corrections. Using perturbation theory on the basis of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian an exact representation of the relativistic exchange-correlation energy [Formula Presented] in terms of Kohn-Sham orbitals and eigenvalues is derived. The most simple, viable approximation to this [Formula Presented] is obtained by a second-order expansion in powers of [Formula Presented] which leads to a M{\o}ller-Plesset-type correlation functional [Formula Presented] Due to this origin [Formula Presented] allows a first-principles, seamless description of long-range dispersive forces. The ROPM integral equation that determines the full exchange-correlation four potential [Formula Presented] is presented, and specified in detail for [Formula Presented] We also analyze the Krieger-Li-Iafrate (KLI) approximation to the exact ROPM integral equation, pointing out an inherent ambiguity of the KLI approximation which arises for eigenvalue-dependent [Formula Presented] The gauge properties of [Formula Presented] and the ROPM integral equation are discussed by examining the transversality of the Kohn-Sham current-current response function. It is demonstrated that due to the multiplicative nature of the total effective potential the density functional definition of the no-pair transverse exchange energy guarantees gauge invariance, in contrast to the relativistic Hartree-Fock scheme. On the other hand, the correlation energy is gauge dependent as soon as the no-pair approximation is applied. In addition, we show that the no-pair approximation automatically implies a definite intrinsic gauge for the spatial components of [Formula Presented] The significance of the self-consistent treatment of the transverse interaction for heavy atoms is investigated numerically within the exchange-only limit. By comparing self-consistent with first-order perturbative inclusion of the transverse exchange it is shown that second-order transverse corrections cannot be neglected in calculations of ground state or inner-shell transition energies of heavy atoms, if one aims at spectroscopic accuracy. It is furthermore found that the Breit approximation for the full transverse interaction is not as accurate for the exchange potential as it is for the exchange energy. Finally, the KLI approximation is examined numerically, thereby resolving the ambiguity for the case of the transverse exchange. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

Furthermore, range-separated RPA shows a faster basis set convergence compared to standard full-range RPA making it a promising applicable approach with only one empirical parameter.},

The search for an optimal scaling factor is performed for a set of 50 moderately sized molecules, and the quality of the method is additionally assessed for a benchmark set of 24 organic acceptor molecules. The proposed $\Delta$MP2-SOS(IP) method provides the best results of valence ionization energies as compared to the several standard self-consistent variants of the electron propagator methods at the second and higher orders (EP2, SCS-EP2, EP3, OVGF) with almost CCSD(T) or IP-EOM-CCSD accuracy and the cost of only a single opposite-spin $\Delta$MP2-type calculation (O(N3)). For core ionization energies, our new methods outperform the standard $\Delta$MP2 results due to a better balanced treatment of the correlation and relaxation term in the second-order self-energy.},

Establishing the level alignment experimentally is complicated by the uncertain chemical identity of the surface species. We address the assignment of the occupied and empty electronic levels for the prototypical photocatalytic system consisting of methanol on a rutile TiO2(110) surface. Using many-body quasiparticle (QP) techniques, we show that the frontier levels measured in UV photoelectron and two-photon photoemission spectroscopy experiments can be assigned to molecularly chemisorbed methanol rather than its dissociated product, the methoxy species. We find that the highest occupied molecular orbital of the methoxy species is much closer to the valence band maximum, suggesting why it is more photocatalytically active than the methanol molecule. We develop a general semiquantitative model for predicting many-body QP energies based on the electronic screening within the bulk, molecular, or vacuum regions of the wave functions at molecule-semiconductor interfaces. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

J. Quantum Chem. 96, 577 (2004)]. It is shown how couplings between electronic transitions on different subsystems can be seamlessly incorporated into the formalism to overcome some of the shortcomings of the approximate TDDFT-FDE approach in use so far, which was only applicable for local subsystem excitations. In contrast to that, the approach presented here allows to include couplings between excitations on different subsystems, which become very important in aggregates composed of several similar chromophores, e.g., in biological or biomimetic light-harvesting systems. A connection to F{\"{o}}rster- and Dexter-type excitation energy coupling expressions is established. A hybrid approach is presented and tested, in which excitation energy couplings are selectively included between different chromophore fragments, but neglected for inactive parts of the environment. It is furthermore demonstrated that the coupled TDDFT-FDE approach can cure the inability of the uncoupled FDE approach to describe induced circular dichroism in dimeric chromophores, a feature known as a "couplet," which is also related to couplings between (nearly) degenerate electronic transitions. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {It is often stated that the Kohn-Sham occupied-unoccupied gap in both molecules and solids is "wrong". We argue that this is not a correct statement. The KS theory does not allow to interpret the exact KS HOMO-LUMO gap as the fundamental gap (difference (I - A) of electron affinity (A) and ionization energy (I), twice the chemical hardness), from which it indeed differs, strongly in molecules and moderately in solids. The exact Kohn-Sham HOMO-LUMO gap in molecules is much below the fundamental gap and very close to the much smaller optical gap (first excitation energy), and LDA/GGA yield very similar gaps. In solids the situation is different: the excitation energy to delocalized excited states and the fundamental gap (I - A) are very similar, not so disparate as in molecules. Again the Kohn-Sham and LDA/GGA band gaps do not represent (I - A) but are significantly smaller. However, the special properties of an extended system like a solid make it very easy to calculate the fundamental gap from the ground state (neutral system) band structure calculations entirely within a density functional framework. The correction $\Delta$ from the KS gap to the fundamental gap originates from the response part vresp of the exchange-correlation potential and can be calculated very simply using an approximation to vresp. This affords a calculation of the fundamental gap at the same level of accuracy as other properties of crystals at little extra cost beyond the ground state bandstructure calculation. The method is based on integer electron systems, fractional electron systems (an ensemble of N- and (N + 1)-electron systems) and the derivative discontinuity are not invoked.},

With range separation, they reach mean absolute errors on the equilibrium interaction energies of the S22 set of about 0.4 kcal/mol, corresponding to mean absolute percentage errors of about 4, with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We have calculated total energies of atoms and diatomic molecules from the Luttinger-Ward functional, using self-energy approximations to second order as well as the GW approximation. In order to assess the variational quality of this functional, we have also solved the Dyson equation self-consistently. The Luttinger-Ward functional is compared to the variational functional due to Klein, and we demonstrate that the variational property of the latter functional is inferior to that of the Luttinger-Ward functional. We also show how to obtain variational density functionals from the functionals of the Green function. These orbital functional schemes are important for systems where density-functional theory using local functionals of the density necessarily fails. We derive an optimized effective potential (OEP) scheme that is based on the Luttinger-Ward functional and, unlike the conventional OEP schemes, produces energies in good agreement with the values obtained from the self-consistent Green function. Our calculations show that, when applied to molecules, the Luttinger-Ward functional is more sensitive to the quality of the input Green function than when applied to atoms, but the energies are remarkably close to the self-consistent values when the Hartree-Fock Green function is used as input. This Luttinger-Ward functional is therefore a simple and efficient method for studying the merits of various self-energy approximations while avoiding the computationally demanding task of solving the Dyson equation self-consistently. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Pavlyukh2020,
abstract = {Diagrammatic perturbation theory is a powerful tool for the investigation of interacting many-body systems, the self-energy operator ς encoding all the variety of scattering processes. In the simplest scenario of correlated electrons described by the GW approximation for the electron self-energy, a particle transfers a part of its energy to neutral excitations. Higher-order (in screened Coulomb interaction W) self-energy diagrams lead to improved electron spectral functions (SFs) by taking more complicated scattering channels into account and by adding corrections to lower order self-energy terms. However, they also may lead to unphysical negative spectral functions. The resolution of this difficulty has been demonstrated in our previous works. The main idea is to represent the self-energy operator in a Fermi golden rule form which leads to a manifestly positive definite SF and allows for a very efficient numerical algorithm. So far, the method has only been applied to the three-dimensional electron gas, which is a paradigmatic system, but a rather simple one. Here we systematically extend the method to two dimensions including realistic systems such as monolayer and bilayer graphene. We focus on one of the most important vertex function effects involving the exchange of two particles in the final state. We demonstrate that it should be evaluated with the proper screening and discuss its influence on the quasiparticle properties.},

As the other methods addressing the electronic correlation, the GW self-energy unfortunately shows a very slow convergence with respect to the basis complexity, which precludes the calculation of accurate quasiparticle energies for large molecules. Here we propose a method to mitigate this issue that relies on two steps: (i) the definition of a reduced virtual orbital subspace, thanks to a much smaller basis set; (ii) the account of the remainder through the simpler one-ring approximation to the self-energy. We assess the quality of the corrected quasiparticle energies for simple molecules, and finally we show an application to large graphene chunks to demonstrate the numerical efficiency of the scheme.},

The goal is to provide an accurate and universal solution for cases where no optimized ABSs are available. In this context, “universal” is understood as the ability of the ABS to be used for Coulomb, exchange, and correlation energy fitting. The generation scheme (denoted AutoAux) works by spanning the product space of the OBS using an even-tempered expansion for each atom in the system. The performance of AutoAux in conjunction with different OBSs [def2-SVP, def2-TZVP, def2-QZVPP, and cc-pwCVnZ (n = D, T, Q, 5)] has been evaluated for elements from H to Rn and compared to existing predefined ABSs. Due to the requirements of simplicity and universality, the generated ABSs are larger than the optimized ones but lead to similar errors in MP2 total energies (on the order of 10-5 to 10-4 Eh/atom).},

Advantages of the PA are its polynomial scaling with the number of orbitals, and the natural calculation of one- and two-particle spectral functions as well as of response and correlation functions. We find large differences in the electronic correlations in the PPP model compared to a Hubbard model with only local interactions. The quasiparticle renormalization (or mass enhancement) is much weaker in the PPP than in the Hubbard model, but the static part of the self-energy enhances the band gap of the former. Furthermore, the vertex corrections to the optical conductivity are much more important in the PPP model. Because nonlocal interactions strongly alter the self-energy, we conclude that the PA is more suitable for calculating conjugated $\pi$ bonds in molecules than single site dynamical mean-field theory.},

While the electron-phonon interaction has been studied for almost a century, predictive nonempirical calculations have become feasible only during the past two decades. Today it is possible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related to the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the temperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron mass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the nonadiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. In this article a review of the theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon calculations from first principles as well as landmark investigations of the electron-phonon interaction in real materials is given. The first part of the article summarizes the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their calculations based on density-functional theory. The second part discusses a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem and establishes the connection with practical first-principles calculations. The third part reviews a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon interactions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. A meta-generalized gradient approximation density functional paired with the VV10 nonlocal correlation functional is presented. The functional form is selected from more than 1010 choices carved out of a functional space of almost 1040 possibilities. Raw data come from training a vast number of candidate functional forms on a comprehensive training set of 1095 data points and testing the resulting fits on a comprehensive primary test set of 1153 data points. Functional forms are ranked based on their ability to reproduce the data in both the training and primary test sets with minimum empiricism, and filtered based on a set of physical constraints and an often-overlooked condition of satisfactory numerical precision with medium-sized integration grids. The resulting optimal functional form has 4 linear exchange parameters, 4 linear same-spin correlation parameters, and 4 linear opposite-spin correlation parameters, for a total of 12 fitted parameters. The final density functional, B97M-V, is further assessed on a secondary test set of 212 data points, applied to several large systems including the coronene dimer and water clusters, tested for the accurate prediction of intramolecular and intermolecular geometries, verified to have a readily attainable basis set limit, and checked for grid sensitivity. Compared to existing density functionals, B97M-V is remarkably accurate for non-bonded interactions and very satisfactory for thermochemical quantities such as atomization energies, but inherits the demonstrable limitations of existing local density functionals for barrier heights.},

abstract = {A completely integral-direct, disk I/O, and network traffic economic coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] implementation has been developed relying on the density-fitting approximation. By fully exploiting the permutational symmetry, the presented algorithm is highly operation count and memory-efficient. Our measurements demonstrate excellent strong scaling achieved via hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization and a highly competitive, 60-70{\%} utilization of the theoretical peak performance on up to hundreds of cores. The terms whose evaluation time becomes significant only for small-to medium-sized examples have also been extensively optimized. Consequently, high performance is also expected for systems appearing in extensive data sets used, e.g., for density functional or machine learning parametrizations, and in calculations required for certain reduced-cost or local approximations of CCSD(T), such as in our local natural orbital scheme [LNO-CCSD(T)]. The efficiency of this implementation allowed us to perform some of the largest CCSD(T) calculations ever presented for systems of 31-43 atoms and 1037-1569 orbitals using only four to eight many-core CPUs and 1-3 days of wall time. The resulting 13 correlation energies and the 12 corresponding reaction energies and barrier heights are added to our previous benchmark set collecting reference CCSD(T) results of molecules at the applicability limit of current implementations.},

In this paper I describe a nontrivial model consisting of two electrons on the surface of a sphere, interacting with the normal long-range Coulomb potential, and show that the GW self-energy, in the absence of self-consistency, can in fact be derived completely analytically in this case. The resulting expression is subsequently used to analyze the convergence of the energy gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied quasiparticle orbital with respect to the total number of states included in the spectral summations. The asymptotic formula for the truncation error obtained in this way, whose dominant contribution is proportional to the cutoff energy to the power -3/2, may be adapted to extrapolate energy gaps in other systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

This is especially important in the low-density regime.

Both are combined with the resolution-of-the-identity approximation for electron repulsion integrals to achieve unprecedented low operation counts, input-output, and disc space demands. To avoid the storage of double excitation amplitudes during the calculation of derivatives of density matrices, we employ in addition a numerical Laplace transformation for orbital energy denominators. It is shown that the error introduced by this approximation is negligible already with a small number of sampling points. Thereby an implementation of second-order one-particle properties is realized, which avoids completely the storage of quantities scaling with the fourth power of the system size. The implementation is tested on a set of organic molecules including large fused aromatic ring systems and the C(60) fullerene. It is demonstrated that exploiting symmetry and shared memory parallelization, second-order properties for such systems can be evaluated at the CC2 and MP2 level within a few hours of calculation time. As large scale applications, we present results for the 7-, 9-, and 11-ring helicenes.},

In order to quantify recent advancements and identify directions for improvement, we have examined a broad spectrum of test problems. We evaluate the performance of several new hybrid density functionals ($\omega$B97, $\omega$B97X, $\omega$B97X-D, LRC-$\omega$PBEh, M06, M06-2X, and M06-HF) on a variety of chemical problems, some sensitive to the treatment of exact exchange (which we have hoped to systematically improve) and some which require a balanced treatment of correlation. Since all of the functionals under consideration are parameterized with ground-state thermochemical data, the benchmark aims to determine the applicability of the new density functionals to cases that have not been considered in the optimization of the semi-empirical parameters. The first class of benchmarks includes the excitation energies of 21 molecules (83 states) primarily from a recent benchmark conducted by Tozer and co-workers, with some additional references from data made available from the groups of Thiel and Truhlar. We briefly examine the conformational preferences of a small peptide and complete our study with two recently published sets of data that have shown large, systematic errors in simple alkane thermochemistry. While our results indicate that the more general hybrids currently under development perform well for problems outside of their parameterization and improve over the standard hybrid density functionals in an essentially systematic way, there is still a significant self-interaction error in the more difficult cases. Functionals based on a range-separation of exchange and functionals depending on the kinetic-energy density both perform comparably, and there is evidence for complementary strengths. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies 2011.},

We evaluate the performance of 65 contemporary density functional theory (DFT) and double-hybrid DFT (DHDFT) procedures. The CRBH20 database represents an extremely challenging test for these methods. Most of the conventional DFT functionals (74{\%}) result in root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) between 10 and 81 kJ mol-1. The rest of the DFT functionals attain RMSDs = 5 - 10 kJ mol-1. Of the 12 tested DHDFT functionals, only five result in RMSDs -1. The CRBH20 dataset also proves to be a surprisingly challenging target for composite and standard ab initio procedures.},

Our approach is based on the linearization of the self-energy around zero frequency which differs it from the existing implementations of the QSGW method. The linearization allows us to use Matsubara frequencies instead of working on the real axis. This results in efficiency gains by switching to the imaginary time representation in the same way as in the space time method. The all electron LAPW basis set eliminates the need for pseudopotentials. We discuss the advantages of our approach, such as its N3 scaling with the system size N, as well as its shortcomings. We apply our approach to study the electronic properties of selected semiconductors, insulators, and simple metals and show that our code produces the results very close to the previously published QSGW data. Our implementation is a good platform for further many body diagrammatic resummations such as the vertex-corrected GW approach and the GW+DMFT method.

abstract = {We present the concept, derivation, and implementation of dynamical configuration interaction, a quantum embedding theory that combines Green's function methodology with the many-body wave function. In a strongly correlated active space, we use full configuration interaction (CI) to describe static correlation exactly. We add energy-dependent corrections to the CI Hamiltonian which, in principle, include all remaining correlations derived from the bath space surrounding the active space. Next, we replace the exact Hamiltonian in the bath with one of excitations defined over a correlated ground state. This transformation is naturally suited to the methodology of many-body Green's functions. In this space, we use a modified GW/Bethe-Salpeter equation procedure to calculate excitation energies. Combined with an estimate of the ground-state energy in the bath, we can efficiently compute the energy-dependent corrections, which correlate the full set of orbitals, for very low computational cost. We present dimer dissociation curves for H2 and N2 in good agreement with exact results. Additionally, excited states of N2 and C2 are in excellent agreement with benchmark theory and experiment. By combining the strengths of two disciplines, we achieve a balanced description of static and dynamic correlation in a fully ab initio, systematically improvable framework.},

abstract = {The accurate prediction of singlet and triplet excitation energies is an area of intense research of significant fundamental interest and critical for many applications. Most calculations of singlet and triplet energies use time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in conjunction with an approximate exchange-correlation functional. In this work, we examine and critically assess an alternative method for predicting low-lying neutral excitations with similar computational cost, the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach, and compare results against high-accuracy wavefunction-based methods. We consider singlet and triplet excitations of 27 prototypical organic molecules, including members of Thiel's set, the acene series, and several aromatic hydrocarbons exhibiting charge-transfer-like excitations. Analogous to its impact in TDDFT, we find that the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) overcomes triplet instabilities in the BSE approach, improving both triplet and singlet energetics relative to higher level theories. Finally, we find that BSE-TDA calculations built on effective DFT starting points, such as those utilizing optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functionals, can yield accurate singlet and triplet excitation energies for gas-phase organic molecules.},

abstract = {Of particular interest in radiation-induced charge transfer processes in DNA is the extent of hole localization immediately after ionization and subsequent relaxation. To address this, we considered double stranded oligomers containing guanine (G) and 8-oxoguanine (8OG), i.e., ds(5′-GGG-3′) and ds(5′-G8OGG-3′) in B-DNA conformation. Using DFT, we calculated a variety of properties, viz., vertical and adiabatic ionization potentials, spin density distributions in oxidized stacks, solvent and solute reorganization energies and one-electron oxidation potential (E0) in the aqueous phase. Calculations for the vertical state of the-GGG-cation radical showed that the spin was found mainly (67{\%}) on the middle G. However, upon relaxation to the adiabatic-GGG-cation radical, the spin localized (96{\%}) on the 5′-G, as observed in experiments. Hole localizations on the middle G and 3′-G were higher in energy by 0.5 kcal mol-1 and 0.4 kcal mol-1, respectively, than that of 5′-G. In the-G8OGG-cation radical, the spin localized only on the 8OG in both vertical and adiabatic states. The calculated vertical ionization potentials of-GGG-and-G8OGG-stacks were found to be lower than that of the vertical ionization potential of a single G in DNA. The calculated E0 values of-GGG-and-G8OGG-stacks are 1.15 and 0.90 V, respectively, which owing to stacking effects are substantially lower than the corresponding experimental E0 values of their monomers (1.49 and 1.18 V, respectively). SOMO to HOMO level switching is observed in these oxidized stacks. Consequently, our calculations predict that local double oxidations in DNA will form triplet diradical states, which are especially significant for high LET radiations.},

abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory faces an important problem when it comes to extended systems: The long-range component of the exchange-correlation kernel fxc is completely absent from local density or generalized gradient approximations, but it is believed to be present in the "exact" fxc. Several attempts have been made to solve this issue, the simplest of them being the use of a model static long-range kernel of the form -$\alpha$static/q2. In this paper, we propose and motivate a dynamical extension of this model of the form -($\alpha$+$\beta$$\omega$2)/q2. The dynamical model is then used to calculate the dielectric function of a large variety of semiconductors and insulators. The absorption spectra of large gap insulators are remarkably improved with respect to calculations where the kernel is taken to be static. This approach is valid also for energies in the range of plasmons, and hence it yields, e.g., good electron energy loss spectra. Finally, we present some simple theoretical arguments that relate the parameters of the model to physical quantities, like the dielectric constant and the plasmon frequency. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

Phys. 2006, 124, 34108] replaces a fraction of the semi-local correlation energy by a non-local correlation energy expression that employs the Kohn-Sham orbitals in second-order many-body perturbation theory. These functionals have provided results of high accuracy over a wide range of properties but fail to accurately describe long-range van der Waals interactions. In this work, a distance-dependent scaling factor for the non-local correlation energy is introduced to address this problem, and two new double-hybrid density functionals are proposed. The new functionals are optimized with the finite cc-pVTZ basis on training sets of atomization energies and intermolecular interaction energies. They are compared against (scaled) second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theories and popular density functionals including the hybrid-GGA functional B3-LYP and the first double-hybrid functional (B2-PLYP). Tests are performed on an extensive set including reaction energies, barrier heights, weakly interacting complexes, transition-metal systems, molecular geometries, and harmonic vibrational frequencies. Within the cc-pVTZ atomic orbital basis, we have demonstrated the ability to find a parametrization scheme which is simultaneously able to describe thermochemistry and weakly bound systems with a satisfactory degree of accuracy.},

Our scheme is based on the contour deformation technique and allows for a precise and efficient calculation of the self-energy, which has a complicated pole structure for core states. The accuracy of our method is validated by comparing to a fully analytic GW algorithm. Furthermore, we report the obtained core-level binding energies and their deviations from experiment for a set of small molecules and large polycyclic hydrocarbons. The core-level excitations computed with our GW approach deviate by less than 0.5 eV from the experimental reference. For comparison, we also report core-level binding energies calculated by density functional theory (DFT)-based approaches such as the popular delta self-consistent field ($\Delta$SCF) method.

A simple scaling of the ZORA one‐electron Hamiltonian is shown to yield energies for the hydrogenlike atom that are exactly equal to the Dirac energies. The regular approximation is not gauge invariant in each order, but the scaled ZORA energy can be shown to be exactly gauge invariant for hydrogenic ions. It is practically gauge invariant for many‐electron systems and proves superior to the (unscaled) first order regular approximation for atomic ionization energies. The regular approximation, if scaled, can therefore be applied already in zeroth order to molecular bond energies. Scalar relativistic density functional all‐electron and frozen core calculations on diatomics, consisting of copper,silver, and gold and their hydrides are presented. We used exchange‐correlation energy functionals commonly used in nonrelativistic calculations; both in the local‐density approximation (LDA) and including density‐gradient (‘‘nonlocal'') corrections (NLDA). At the NLDA level the calculated dissociation energies are all within 0.2 eV from experiment, with an average of 0.1 eV.

The resulting scheme is general and is particularly well adapted to describe van der Waals complexes, such as rare gas dimers. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

Such set has been optimized in order to furnish accurate absorption spectra using the complex polarizability algorithm of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). An automatic procedure has been set up, able, thanks to the definition of suitable descriptors, to evaluate the resemblance of the auxiliary basis-dependent calculated spectra with respect to a reference. In this way, it has been possible to reduce the size of the basis set maximizing the basis set accuracy. Thanks to the choice to employ a collection of molecules for each element, such basis has proven transferable to molecules outside the collection. The final sets are therefore much more accurate and smaller than the previously optimized ones and have been already included in the database of the last release of the AMS suite of programs. The availability of the present new set will allow to improve drastically the applicability range of the polTDDFT method with higher accuracy and less computational effort.},

However, numerical calculations at the two-particle level often suffer from large computation time and massive memory consumption. We derive a general expansion formula for the two-particle Green's functions in terms of an overcomplete representation based on the recently proposed "intermediate representation" basis. The expansion formula is obtained by decomposing the spectral representation of the two-particle Green's function. We demonstrate that the expansion coefficients decay exponentially, while all high-frequency and long-tail structures in the Matsubara-frequency domain are retained. This representation therefore enables efficient treatment of two-particle quantities and opens a route to the application of modern many-body theories to realistic strongly correlated electron systems.},

In practical model systems, the benchmark interaction energies are usually obtained using composite CCSD(T)/CBS schemes. To use these results as a benchmark, their accuracy should be estimated first. We analyze the errors of this methodology with respect to both the approximations involved and the basis set size. We list the most prominent data sets covering various aspects of the field, from general ones to sets focusing on specific types of interactions or systems. The benchmark data are then used to validate more efficient computational approaches, including those based on explicitly correlated methods. Special attention is paid to the transition to large systems, where accurate benchmarking is difficult or impossible, and to the importance of nonequilibrium geometries in parametrization of more approximate methods.},

abstract = {Photosystem II (PS II) captures solar energy and directs charge separation (CS) across the thylakoid membrane during photosynthesis. The highly oxidizing, charge-separated state generated within its reaction center (RC) drives water oxidation. Spectroscopic studies on PS II RCs are difficult to interpret due to large spectral congestion, necessitating modeling to elucidate key spectral features. Herein, we present results from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations on the largest PS II RC model reported to date. This model explicitly includes six RC chromophores and both the chlorin phytol chains and the amino acid residues {\textless}6 {\AA} from the pigments' porphyrin ring centers. Comparing our wild-type model results with calculations on mutant D1-His-198-Ala and D2-His-197-Ala RCs, our simulated absorption-difference spectra reproduce experimentally observed shifts in known chlorophyll absorption bands, demonstrating the predictive capabilities of this model. We find that inclusion of both nearby residues and phytol chains is necessary to reproduce this behavior. Our calculations provide a unique opportunity to observe the molecular orbitals that contribute to the excited states that are precursors to CS. Strikingly, we observe two high oscillator strength, low-lying states, in which molecular orbitals are delocalized over ChlD1 and PheD1 as well as one weaker oscillator strength state with molecular orbitals delocalized over the P chlorophylls. Both these configurations are a match for previously identified exciton–charge transfer states (ChlD1+PheD1−)* and (PD2+PD1−)*. Our results demonstrate the power of TDDFT as a tool, for studies of natural photosynthesis, or indeed future studies of artificial photosynthetic complexes.},

Classical part of this hybrid entails parametrization of the sparse, fictitious Hamiltonian in such a way that it recovers the self-energy of the original molecular system. Quantum machine then uses this fictitious Hamiltonian to calculate the self-energy of the system. We show that the developed hybrid algorithm yields very good total energies for small molecular test cases while reducing the depth of the quantum circuit by at least an order of magnitude when compared with simulations involving a full Hamiltonian.},

The linear scaling implementation of all post-mean-field steps utilizes the SparseMaps formalism [P. Pinski et al., J. Chem. Phys. 143, 034108 (2015)]. Even for conservative truncation levels, the method rapidly reaches near-linear complexity in realistic basis sets, e.g., an effective scaling exponent of 1.49 was obtained for n-alkanes with up to 200 carbon atoms in a def2-TZVP basis set. The robustness of the method is benchmarked against the massively parallel implementation of the conventional explicitly correlated coupled-cluster for a 20-water cluster; the total dissociation energy of the cluster (∼186 kcal/mol) is affected by the reduced scaling approximations by only ∼0.4 kcal/mol. The reduced scaling explicitly correlated CCSD(T) method is used to examine the binding energies of several systems in the L7 benchmark data set of noncovalent interactions.},

abstract = {A comprehensive overview of the equation of motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) method and its application to molecular systems is presented. By exploiting the biorthogonal nature of the theory, it is shown that excited state properties and transition strengths can be evaluated via a generalized expectation value approach that incorporates both the bra and ket state wave functions. Reduced density matrices defined by this procedure are given by closed form expressions. For the root of the EOM-CC effective Hamiltonian that corresponds to the ground state, the resulting equations are equivalent to the usual expressions for normal single-reference CC density matrices. Thus, the method described in this paper provides a universal definition of coupled-cluster density matrices, providing a link between EOM-CC and traditional ground state CC theory. Excitation energy, oscillator strength, and property calculations are illustrated by means of several numerical examples, including comparisons with full configuration interaction calculations and a detailed study of the ten lowest electronically excited states of the cyclic isomer of C4. {\textcopyright} 1993 American Institute of Physics.},

To this end, we apply a composite protocol consisting of linear-response CCSDT excitation energies determined with Dunning's double-$\zeta$ basis set corrected by CC3/CCSDT-3 energies obtained with the corresponding triple-$\zeta$ basis. Further basis set corrections (up to aug-cc-pVQZ) are obtained at the CCSD and CC2 levels. We report 30 transitions obtained in 17 compounds (aminobenzonitrile, aniline, azulene, benzonitrile, benzothiadiazole, dimethylaminobenzonitrile, dimethylaniline, dipeptide, $\beta$-dipeptide, hydrogen chloride, nitroaniline, nitrobenzene, nitrodimethylaniline, nitropyridine N-oxide, N-phenylpyrrole, phthalazine, and quinoxaline]. These reference values are then used to benchmark a series of wave functions [CIS(D), SOPPA, RPA(D), EOM-MP2, CC2, CCSD, CCSD(T)(a)*, CCSDR(3), CCSDT-3, CC3, ADC(2), ADC(3), and ADC(2.5)], the Green's function-based Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism performed on top of the partially self-consistent evGW scheme considering two different starting points (BSE/evGW@HF and BSE/evGW@PBE0), and time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) combined with several exchange-correlation functionals (B3LYP, PBE0, M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP, LC-$\omega$HPBE, $\omega$B97X, $\omega$B97X-D, and M11). It turns out that the CC methods including triples, namely, CCSD(T)(a)*, CCSDR(3), CCSDT-3, and CC3, provide rather small average deviations (≤0.10 eV), with CC3 emerging as the only chemically accurate approach. ADC(2.5) also performs nicely with a mean absolute error of 0.11 eV for a O(N6) formal scaling, whereas CC2 and BSE/evGW@PBE0 also deliver very satisfying results given their respective O(N5) and O(N4) computational scalings.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society. An integral-direct, iteration-free, linear-scaling, local second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) approach is presented, which is also  useful for spin-scaled MP2 calculations as well as for the efficient evaluation of the perturbative terms of double-hybrid density functionals. The method is based on a fragmentation approximation: the correlation contributions of the individual electron pairs are evaluated in domains constructed for the corresponding localized orbitals, and the correlation energies of distant electron pairs are computed with multipole expansions. The required electron repulsion integrals are calculated directly invoking the density fitting approximation; the storage of integrals and intermediates is avoided. The approach also utilizes natural auxiliary functions to reduce the size of the auxiliary basis of the domains and thereby the operation count and memory requirement. Our test calculations show that the approach recovers 99.9{\%} of the canonical MP2 correlation energy and reproduces reaction energies with an average (maximum) error below 1 kJ/mol (4 kJ/mol). Our benchmark calculations demonstrate that the new method enables MP2 calculations for molecules with more than 2300 atoms and 26000 basis functions on a single processor.},

We use the eigenvectors of the static dielectric matrix as a basis for the frequency-dependent density-density response function, and density functional perturbation theory to avoid the explicit calculation of empty electronic states, and storage and inversion of large dielectric matrices. The numerical accuracy of our approach is controlled by a single parameter that can be systematically varied to test the convergence of the computed quasiparticle energies.

abstract = {CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecu- lar simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of bio- logical interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estima- tors, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numer- ous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983.},

We present here a new experimental approach, automated microwave double resonance (AMDOR) spectroscopy, to rapidly determine the rotational constants of these compounds without a priori knowledge of elemental composition or molecular structure. This task is achieved by rapidly acquiring the classical (frequency vs. intensity) broadband spectrum of a molecule using chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) spectroscopy and subsequently analyzing it in near real-time using complementary cavity FTMW detection and double resonance. AMDOR measurements provide a unique "barcode" for each compound from which rotational constants can be extracted. To illustrate the power of this approach, AMDOR spectra of three aroma compounds - trans-cinnamaldehyde, $\alpha$-, and $\beta$-ionone - have been recorded and analyzed. The prospects to extend this approach to mixture characterization and purity assessment are described.},

His values should be corrected for three reasons: he has neglected the fact that electron distributions are not really spherical; he has not considered the resonant interactions between electrons; and he has made an approximation which amounts to neglecting the polarization energy.

abstract = {Efficient implementations of electronic structure methods are essential for first-principles modeling of molecules and solids. We here present a particularly efficient common framework for methods beyond semilocal density-functional theory, including Hartree-Fock (HF), hybrid density functionals, random-phase approximation (RPA), second-order M{\{}$\backslash$o{\}}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), and the {\$}GW{\$} method. This computational framework allows us to use compact and accurate numeric atom-centered orbitals (popular in many implementations of semilocal density-functional theory) as basis functions. The essence of our framework is to employ the "resolution of identity (RI)" technique to facilitate the treatment of both the two-electron Coulomb repulsion integrals (required in all these approaches) as well as the linear density-response function (required for RPA and {\$}GW{\$}). This is possible because these quantities can be expressed in terms of products of single-particle basis functions, which can in turn be expanded in a set of auxiliary basis functions (ABFs). The construction of ABFs lies at the heart of the RI technique, and here we propose a simple prescription for constructing the ABFs which can be applied regardless of whether the underlying radial functions have a specific analytical shape (e.g., Gaussian) or are numerically tabulated. We demonstrate the accuracy of our RI implementation for Gaussian and NAO basis functions, as well as the convergence behavior of our NAO basis sets for the above-mentioned methods. Benchmark results are presented for the ionization energies of 50 selected atoms and molecules from the G2 ion test set as obtained with {\$}GW{\$} and MP2 self-energy methods, and the G2-I atomization energies as well as the S22 molecular interaction energies as obtained with the RPA method.},

abstract = {We present a fragment-based many-body Green's function method suitable for treating large molecular systems in heterogeneous polarizable environments. The Green's function for a total system is approximated from fragment Green's functions and is expanded up to two-body terms. The screened Coulomb potential is approximated from the sum of intrafragment density-response functions, with interfragment polarization terms being neglected. The approximations for the Green's function and screened Coulomb potential lead to a many-body expansion of the self-energy. This expansion is essentially equivalent to the many-body expansion of the Fock matrix in the fragment molecular orbital method. To handle large molecular systems, the present implementation relies on the Coulomb hole plus screened exchange (COHSEX) approximation for the GW self-energy. The accuracy of the FMO-COHSEX method was demonstrated in comparison to conventional COHSEX results for organic molecular aggregates. We confirmed that the present fragmentation approximation can provide reasonably accurate results, and mean absolute errors for quasiparticle energies of less than 0.1 eV have been achieved for valence orbitals. We also assessed the accuracy of the COHSEX approximation to describe the effects of molecular aggregation of electronic states, by comparing them with the GW method. The COHSEX approximation has been shown to successfully describe the induced polarization and dispersion effects. As an illustrative application of the present method, we considered the electronic states of the pentacene thin film, which contains 1476 atoms. We investigated the impact of the induced polarization effect in the heterogeneous environment, highlighting the gap renormalization and the polarization-induced localization. This application shows that the present fragment-based method is useful for studying electronic structures of molecular aggregates in complex environments.},

abstract = {Light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) is a pigment-protein complex present in higher plants and green algae. LHCII represents the main site of light absorption, and its role is to transfer the excitation energy toward the photosynthetic reaction centers, where primary energy conversion reactions take place. The optical properties of LHCII are known to depend on protein conformation. However, the relation between the structural and spectroscopic properties of the pigments is not fully understood yet. In this respect, previous classical molecular dynamics simulations of LHCII in a model membrane [Sci. Rep. 2015, 5, 1-10] have shown that the configuration and excitonic coupling of a chlorophyll (Chl) dimer functioning as the main terminal emitter of the complex are particularly sensitive to conformational changes. Here, we use quantum chemistry calculations to investigate in greater detail the effect of pigment-pigment interactions on the excited-state landscape. While most previous studies have used a local picture in which electrons are localized on single pigments, here we achieve a more accurate description of the Chl dimer by adopting a supramolecular picture where time-dependent density functional theory is applied to the whole system at once. Our results show that specific dimer configurations characterized by shorter inter-pigment distances can result in a sizable intensity decrease (up to 36{\%}) of the Chl absorption bands in the visible spectral region. Such a decrease can be predicted only when accounting for Chl-Chl charge-transfer excitations, which is possible using the above-mentioned supramolecular approach. The charge-transfer character of the excitations is quantified by two types of analyses: one focusing on the composition of the excitations and the other directly on the observable total absorption intensities.},

Then, the correlation energy of the total system is evaluated by summing up the subsystem contributions other than the buffer regions by the energy density analysis technique. Numerical applications demonstrate that the present DC-CCSD gives highly accurate results with drastically less computational costs with regard to the required computer memory, scratch-disk capacity, and calculation time.},

abstract = {A density-functional method for calculations on periodic systems (periodicity in one, two, or three dimensions) is presented in which all aspects of numerical precision are efficiently controlled. Highly accurate and rapidly converging strategies have been implemented for (a) the computation of Hamiltonian matrix elements (by a numerical integration method based on a partitioning of space and application of product Gauss rules), (b) the approximation of integrals over the Brillouin zone (by the quadratic tetrahedron method), (c) the evaluation and processing of the Coulomb potential (via a density-fitting procedure), and (d) the expansion of one-particle states in suitable basis functions (numerical atomic orbitals, Slater-type exponential functions, and plane waves). Absolute precision and convergence are demonstrated for all these aspects and show that the method is a well-suited tool for unambiguous investigations of the density-functional approximation itself. Attention is given, in particular, to basis-set questions. Although the method is of the mixed-basis type, it is demonstrated that plane waves are not necessary; this holds for metals as well as for insulators and semiconductors. By a general prescription, sequences of accurate linear-combination-of-atomic-orbital (LCAO) basis sets can be defined that systematically approach the basis-set limit. This enables the routine application of the inherently efficient LCAO method to all kinds of systems.

This allows conclusions about the performance of each method in an explorative research setting on "real-life" problems. Most DFT methods show satisfactory performance but, due to the largeness of the complexes, almost always require an explicit correction for the nonadditive Axilrod-Teller-Muto three-body dispersion interaction to get accurate results. The necessity of using a method capable of accounting for dispersion is clearly demonstrated in that the two-body dispersion contributions are on the order of 20-150{\%} of the total interaction energy. MP2 and some variants thereof are shown to be insufficient for this while a few tested D3-corrected semiempirical MO methods perform reasonably well. Overall, we suggest the use of this benchmark set as a "sanity check" against overfitting to too small molecular cases. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

As a consequence, in second-order perturbation theory, the self-energy of two-dimensional dipolar fermions is ultraviolet divergent. We show that for electric dipoles, this divergence can be avoided if one takes into account that physical dipoles consist of two opposite charges which are separated by a finite distance. Using this regularization, we calculate the self-energy, the renormalized chemical potential, and the renormalized Fermi surface of dipolar fermions in two dimensions in second-order perturbation theory. We find that in the Fermi liquid phase, the second-order corrections weaken first-order effects.},

To this end, we present two new Slater-type orbital (STO) basis sets of triple-(TZ) and quadruple-$\zeta$ (QZ) quality, whose polarization is adequate for correlated-electron methods and which contain extra diffuse functions to be able to correctly calculate EAs of molecules with a positive lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). We demonstrate that going from TZ to QZ quality consistently reduces the basis set error of our computed IPs and EAs, and we conclude that a good estimate of these quantities at the CBS limit can be obtained by extrapolation. With mean absolute deviations (MAD) from 70 to 85 meV, our CBS limit-extrapolated IP are in good agreement with results from FHI-AIMS, TURBOMOLE, VASP, and WEST, while they differ by more than 130 meV on average from nanoGW. With a MAD of 160 meV, our EA are also in good agreement with the WEST code. Especially for systems with positive LUMOs, the agreement is excellent. With respect to other codes, the STO-type basis sets generally underestimate EAs of small molecules with strongly bound LUMOs. With 62 meV for IPs and 93 meV for EAs, we find much better agreement with CBS limit-extrapolated results from FHI-AIMS for a set of 250 medium to large organic molecules.},

abstract = {In this work, we apply many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) on large critical charge transfer (CT) complexes to assess its performance on the S1 excitation energy. Since the S1 energy of CT compounds is heavily dependent on the Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange fraction in the reference density functional, MBPT opens a new way for reliable prediction of CT S1 energy without explicit knowledge of suitable amount of HF-exchange, in contrary to the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), where depending on various functionals, large errors can arise. Thus, simply by starting from a (semi-)local reference functional and performing update of Kohn-Sham (KS) energies in the Green's function G while keeping dynamical screened interaction (W($\omega$)) frozen to the mean-field level, we obtain impressingly highly accurate S1 energy at slightly higher computational cost in comparison to TD-DFT. However, this energy-only updating mechanism in G fails to work if the initial guess contains a fraction or 100{\%} HF-exchange, and hence considerably inaccurate S1 energy is predicted. Furthermore, eigenvalue updating both in G and W($\omega$) overshoots the S1 energy due to enhanced underscreening of W($\omega$), independent of the (hybrid-)DFT starting orbitals. A full energy-update on top of HF orbitals even further overestimates the S1 energy. An additional update of KS wave functions within the Quasi-Particle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) deteriorates results, in stark contrast to the good results obtained from QSGW for periodic systems. For the sake of transferability, we further present data of small critical non-charge transfer systems, confirming the outcomes of the CT-systems.},

The experimental reaction enthalpies are corrected for vibrational and thermal effects, and the thus derived "experimental" reaction energies are compared to corresponding theoretical data. A series of standard AO basis sets in combination with second-order perturbation theory (MP2, SCS-MP2), conventional density functional (e.g., PBE, TPSS, B3-LYP, MPW1K, BMK), and new perturbative functionals (B2-PLYP, mPW2-PLYP) are tested. In three cases, obvious errors of the experimental values could be detected, and accurate coupled-cluster [CCSD(T)] reference values have been used instead. It is found that only triple-$\zeta$ quality AO basis sets provide results close enough to the basis set limit and that sets like the popular 6-31G(d) should be avoided in accurate work. Augmentation of small basis sets with diffuse functions has a notable effect in B3-LYP calculations that is attributed to intramolecular basis set superposition error and covers basic deficiencies of the functional. The new methods based on perturbation theory (SCS-MP2, X2-PLYP) are found to be clearly superior to many other approaches; that is, they provide mean absolute deviations of less than 1.2 kcal mol-1 and only a few ({\textless}10{\%}) outliers. The best performance in the group of conventional functionals is found for the highly parametrized BMK hybrid meta-GGA. Contrary to accepted opinion, hybrid density functionals offer no real advantage over simple GGAs. For reasonably large AO basis sets, results of poor quality are obtained with the popular B3-LYP functional that cannot be recommended for thermochemical applications in organic chemistry. The results of this study are complementary to often used benchmarks based on atomization energies and should guide chemists in their search for accurate and efficient computational thermochemistry methods. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

In combination with our multicenter numerical integration scheme reported previously, completely numerical evaluation of arbitrary two‐electron Coulomb integrals is possible.

abstract = {A new approach to the one-particle Green's functions G for finite electronic systems is presented. This approach is based on the diagrammatic perturbation expansions of the Green's function and of the dynamic self-energy part M related to G via the Dyson equation. The exact summation of the latter expansion is reformulated in terms of a simple algebraic form referred to as algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC). The ADC defines in a systematical way a set of approximation schemes (nth-order ADC schemes) that represent infinite partial summations for M and (via the Dyson equation) for G being complete through nth order of perturbation theory. The corresponding mathematical procedures are essentially Hermitian eigenvalue problems in restricted configuration spaces of unperturbed ionic configurations. Explicit equations for the second-, third-, and fourth-order ADC schemes are derived and analyzed. While the second- and third-order schemes can be viewed as systematic rederivations of previous approximation schemes, the fourth-order ADC scheme represents a complete fourth-order approximation for the self-energy and the one-particle Green's function which was hitherto not available. {\textcopyright} 1983 The American Physical Society.},

In addition, it follows from the proof that the normal order theory and corresponding contraction rules hold equally well if the contractions are only defined up to a certain level. These relaxations enable us to extend the original normal order theory. As a particular example, a quasi-normal-order theory is developed, in which only one-body contractions are present.

Here, we show that a range-separated hybrid functional, optimally tuned so as to obey Koopmans' theorem, provides fundamental gaps that are very close to benchmark results obtained from many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation. We then show that using this functional does not compromise the possibility of obtaining reliable optical gaps from time-dependent DFT.

Since these natural orbitals are not natural for the n-electron system they are considered false or pseudonatural orbitals when used in the n-electron problem. The PNO basis has been applied to He2 + and Hs to test the convergence. Complete results are reported here only for He2+. The PNO's are quite successful in speeding up the convergence of the SOC and rendering the calculation of correlation energy quite practical in genera!.

abstract = {Direct random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies have become increasingly popular as a post-Kohn-Sham correction, due to significant improvements over DFT calculations for properties such as long-range dispersion effects, which are problematic in conventional density functional theory. On the other hand, RPA still has various weaknesses, such as unsatisfactory results for non-isogyric processes. This can in parts be attributed to the self-correlation present in RPA correlation energies, leading to significant self-interaction errors. Therefore a variety of schemes have been devised to include exchange in the calculation of RPA correlation energies in order to correct this shortcoming. One of the most popular RPA plus exchange schemes is the second order screened exchange (SOSEX) correction. RPA + SOSEX delivers more accurate absolute correlation energies and also improves upon RPA for non-isogyric processes. On the other hand, RPA + SOSEX barrier heights are worse than those obtained from plain RPA calculations. To combine the benefits of RPA correlation energies and the SOSEX correction, we introduce a short-range RPA + SOSEX correction.

abstract = {The parquet decomposition of the self-energy into classes of diagrams, those associated with specific scattering processes, can be exploited for different scopes. In this work, the parquet decomposition is used to unravel the underlying physics of nonperturbative numerical calculations. We show the specific example of dynamical mean field theory and its cluster extensions [dynamical cluster approximation (DCA)] applied to the Hubbard model at half-filling and with hole doping: These techniques allow for a simultaneous determination of two-particle vertex functions and self-energies and, hence, for an essentially "exact" parquet decomposition at the single-site or at the cluster level. Our calculations show that the self-energies in the underdoped regime are dominated by spin-scattering processes, consistent with the conclusions obtained by means of the fluctuation diagnostics approach [O. Gunnarsson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 236402 (2015)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.114.236402]. However, differently from the latter approach, the parquet procedure displays important changes with increasing interaction: Even for relatively moderate couplings, well before the Mott transition, singularities appear in different terms, with the notable exception of the predominant spin channel. We explain precisely how these singularities, which partly limit the utility of the parquet decomposition and, more generally, of parquet-based algorithms, are never found in the fluctuation diagnostics procedure. Finally, by a more refined analysis, we link the occurrence of the parquet singularities in our calculations to a progressive suppression of charge fluctuations and the formation of a resonance valence bond state, which are typical hallmarks of a pseudogap state in DCA.},

abstract = {Recently several schemes have been proposed to perform self-consistent GW calculations within a one-particle (quasiparticle) approximation. These so-called quasiparticle self-consistent GW schemes have been found to be successful in reproducing band gaps of semiconductors but there is some arbitrariness in the choice of the "effective" one-particle Hamiltonian in these schemes and their validity has not been assessed. To avoid ambiguity in choosing the one-particle Hamiltonian, we propose a scheme which is based on L{\"{o}}wdin's method of symmetric orthogonalization. In our approach we first calculate the true quasiparticle wave functions and energies with the real part of the frequency-dependent self-energy, and then orthonormalize these states using L{\"{o}}wdin's procedure to construct the effective quasiparticle Hamiltonian. L{\"{o}}wdin's procedure ensures that the obtained orthonormal orbitals are the closest to the original nonorthogonal quasiparticle wave functions in the least-square sense and uniquely defines the one-particle Hamiltonian. Unlike previous approaches, this approach takes into account the full frequency dependence and the off-diagonal elements of the self-energy without ambiguity.

abstract = {We propose an extension of the basis sets proposed by Ahlrichs and coworkers at Karlsruhe (these basis sets are designated as the second-generation default or "def2" basis sets in the Turbomole program). The Karlsruhe basis sets are very appealing because they constitute balanced and economical basis sets of graded quality from partially polarized double zeta to heavily polarized quadruple zeta for all elements up to radon (Z = 86). The extension consists of adding a minimal set of diffuse functions to a subset of the elements. This yields basis sets labeled minimally augmented or with "ma" as a prefix. We find that diffuse functions are not quite as important for the def2 basis sets as they are for Pople basis sets, but they are still necessary for good results on barrier heights and electron affinities. We provide assessments and validations of this extension for a variety of data sets and representative cases. We recommend the new ma-TZVP basis set for general-purpose applications of density functional theory. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The structure of photosystem II has been reported at resolutions from 3.8 to 2.9-‰{\~{A}}. These resolutions have provided much information on the arrangement of protein subunits and cofactors but are insufficient to reveal the detailed structure of the catalytic centre of water splitting. Here we report the crystal structure of photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9-‰{\~{A}}. From our electron density map, we located all of the metal atoms of the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster, together with all of their ligands. We found that five oxygen atoms served as oxo bridges linking the five metal atoms, and that four water molecules were bound to the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster; some of them may therefore serve as substrates for dioxygen formation. We identified more than 1,300 water molecules in each photosystem II monomer. Some of them formed extensive hydrogen-bonding networks that may serve as channels for protons, water or oxygen molecules. The determination of the high-resolution structure of photosystem II will allow us to analyse and understand its functions in great detail. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {A novel method for the accurate and efficient calculation of interaction energies in weakly bound complexes composed of a large number of molecules is presented. The new ALMO+RPAd method circumvents the prohibitive scaling of coupled cluster singles and doubles while still providing similar accuracy across a diverse range of weakly bound chemical systems. Linear-scaling procedures for the Fock build are given utilizing absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMOs), resulting in the a priori exclusion of basis set superposition errors. A bespoke data structure and algorithm using density fitting are described, leading to linear scaling for the storage and computation of the two-electron integrals. Electron correlation is included through a new, linear-scaling pairwise local random phase approximation approach, including exchange interactions, and decomposed into purely dispersive excitations (RPAxd). Collectively, these allow meaningful decomposition of the interaction energy into physically distinct contributions: electrostatic, polarization, charge transfer, and dispersion. Comparison with symmetry-adapted perturbation theory shows good qualitative agreement. Tests on various dimers and the S66 benchmark set demonstrate results within 0.5 kcal mol-1 of coupled cluster singles and doubles results. On a large cluster of water molecules, we achieve calculations involving over 3500 orbital and 12,000 auxiliary basis functions in under 10 min on a single CPU core.},

Within this famework, the ACFDT analog of the second order screened exchange (SOSEX) approximation leads to a logarithmic formula for the correlation energy similar to the direct RPA expression. Alternatively, the contribution of the exchange can be included in the kernel used to evaluate the response functions. In this case, the use of an approximate kernel is crucial to simplify the formalism and to obtain a correlation energy in logarithmic form. Technical details of the implementation of these methods are discussed, and it is shown that one can take advantage of density fitting or Cholesky decomposition techniques to improve the computational efficiency; a discussion on the numerical quadrature made on the frequency variable is also provided. A series of test calculations on atomic correlation energies and molecular reaction energies shows that exchange effects are instrumental for improvement over direct RPA results.},

However, benchmarking of the algorithms and basis sets is essential for a careful balance between cost and accuracy. In this paper, we present an implementation of the GW approximation using numerical atomic orbitals and a pseudopotential treatment of core electrons. The combination of a contour deformation technique with a one-shot extraction of quasiparticle energies provides an efficient scheme for many applications. The performance of the implementation with respect to the basis set convergence and the effect of the use of pseudopotentials has been tested for the 117 closed-shell molecules from the G2/97 test set and 24 larger acceptor molecules from another recently proposed test set. Moreover, to demonstrate the potential of our method, we compute the thermally averaged GW density of states of a large photochromic compound by sampling ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories at different temperatures. The computed thermal line widths indicate approximately twice as large electron-phonon couplings with GW than with standard DFT-GGA calculations. This is further confirmed using frozen-phonon calculations.},

Our reformulation is based on two ideas, which are independently useful: First, a Cholesky decomposition of density matrices that reduces the scaling with basis set size for a fixed-size molecule by one order, leading to massive performance improvements. Second, replacement of the overlap RI metric used in the original AO-RPA by an attenuated Coulomb metric. Accuracy is significantly improved compared to the overlap metric, while locality and sparsity of the integrals are retained, as is the effective linear scaling behavior.},

The backbone geometries are close to the clustering-means of their respective RNA bioinformatics family classification. High-level wave function methods (DLPNO-CCSD(T) as reference) and a wide-range of dispersion-corrected or inclusive DFT methods (DFT-D3, VV10, LC-BOP-LRD, M06-2X, M11, and more) are used to evaluate the conformational energies. The results are compared to the Amber RNA bsc0$\chi$ OL3 force field. Most dispersion-corrected DFT methods surpass the Amber force field significantly in accuracy and yield mean absolute deviations (MADs) for relative conformational energies of ∼0.4-0.6 kcal/mol. Double-hybrid density functionals represent the most accurate class of density functionals. Low-cost quantum chemical methods such as PM6-D3H+, HF-3c, DFTB3-D3, as well as small basis set calculations corrected for basis set superposition errors (BSSEs) by the gCP procedure are also tested. Unfortunately, the presently available low-cost methods are struggling to describe the UpU conformational energies with satisfactory accuracy.

In this work, quantitative data is presented to illustrate the effects of this integral screening on the scaling properties of the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. Calculations are performed on a range of carbon-hydrogen model systems, two-dimensional graphitic sheets, and three-dimensional diamond pieces, to determine the effective scaling exponent a of the computational expense. The data obtained in this paper for calculations including over 250 carbon atoms and 1500 basis functions shows two significant trends: (1) in the asymptotic limit of large molecules, a is found to be approximately 2.2-2.3, and (2) for molecules of modest size, a is still very much less than 4.

abstract = {The calculation of redox potentials by semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) approaches is evaluated with a focus on the recently developed GFNn-xTB methods. The assessment is based on a data set comprising 313 experimental redox potentials of small to medium-sized organic and organometallic molecules in various solvents. This compilation is termed as ROP313 (reduction and oxidation potentials 313) and divided for analysis purposes into the organic subset OROP and the organometallic subset OMROP. Corresponding data for a few common density functional theory (DFT) functionals employing extended AO basis sets and small basis-set DFT composite schemes are computed for comparison. Continuum solvation models are used to calculate the important solvation free energy contribution. The results for ROP313 show that the GFNn-xTB methods provide a robust, efficient, and generally applicable workflow for the routine calculation of redox potentials. The GFNn-xTB methods outperform the PMx competitor for the OROP subset (mean absolute deviation from the experiment, MADGFN2-xTB = 0.30 V, MADGFN1-xTB = 0.31 V, PM6-D3H4 = 0.61 V, PM7 = 0.60 V), almost reaching low-cost DFT quality (MADB97-3c = 0.25 V) at drastically reduced computational cost (2-3 orders of magnitude). All SQM methods perform considerably worse for the OMROP subset. Here, the GFN2-xTB still yields semiquantitative results slightly better and more robustly than with the PMx methods (MADGFN2-xTB = 0.74 V, PM6-D3H4 = 0.78 V, PM7 = 0.82 V). The proposed workflow enables large-scale quantum chemical computations of organic and, to a lesser extent, organometallic molecule redox potentials on common laptop computers in seconds to minutes of computation time enabling, e.g., screening of extended compound libraries.},

abstract = {In order to calculate the average value of a physical quantity containing also many-particle interactions in a system of N antisymmetric particles, a set of generalized density matrices are defined. In order to permit the investigation of the same physical situation in two complementary spaces, the Hermitean density matrix of order k has two sets of indices of each k variables, and it is further antisymmetric in each set of these indices. Every normalizable antisymmetric wave function may be expanded in a series of determinants of order N over all ordered configurations formed from a basic complete set of one-particle functions k, which gives a representation of the wave function and its density matrices also in the discrete k-space. The coefficients in an expansion of an eigenfunction to a particular operator may be determined by the variation principle, leading to the ordinary secular equation of the method of configurational interaction. It is shown that the first-order density matrix may be brought to diagonal form, which defines the "natural spin-orbitals" associated with the system. The situation is then partly characterized by the corresponding occupation numbers, which are shown to lie between 0 and 1 and to assume the value 1, only if the corresponding spin-orbital occurs in all configurations necessary for describing the situation. If the system has exactly N spin-orbitals which are fully occupied, the total wave function may be reduced to a single Slater determinant. However, due to the mutual interaction between the particles, this limiting case is never physically realized, but the introduction of natural spin-orbitals leads then instead to a configurational expansion of most rapid convergence. In case the basic set is of finite order M, the best choice of this set is determined by a form of extended Hartree-Fock equations. It is shown that, in this case, the natural spin-orbitals approximately fulfill some equations previously proposed by Slater. {\textcopyright} 1955 The American Physical Society.},

Although both approximations contain topologically identical diagrams, the nonlocality and frequency dependence of the GW self-energy crucially influence the different energy contributions to the total energy as compared to the use of a static local potential in the RPA. The latter leads to significantly larger correlation energies, which allow for a better description of static correlation at intermediate bond distances. The substantial error found in GW is further analyzed by comparing spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted calculations. At large but finite nuclear separation, their difference gives an estimate of the so-called fractional spin error normally determined only in the dissociation limit. Furthermore, a calculation of the dipole moment of the LiH molecule at dissociation reveals a large delocalization error in GW making the fractional charge error comparable to the RPA. The analyses are supplemented by explicit formulas for the GW Green's function and total energy of a simplified two-level model providing additional insights into the dissociation limit.},

abstract = {The description of ground state charge-transfer complexes is highly challenging. Illustrative examples include large overestimations of charge-transfer by local and semilocal density functional approximations as well as inaccurate binding energies. It is demonstrated here that standard density functionals fail to accurately describe interaction energies of charge-transfer complexes not only because of the missing long-range exchange as generally assumed but also as a result of the neglect of weak interactions. Thus, accounting for the missing van der Waals interactions is of key importance. These assertions, based on the evaluation of the extent of stabilization due to dispersion using both DFT coupled with our recent density-dependent dispersion correction (dDsC) and high-level ab initio computations, reflect the imperfect error-cancellation between the overestimation of charge-transfer and the missing long-range interactions. An in-depth energy decomposition analysis of an illustrative series of four small ambidentate molecules (HCN, HNC, HF, and ClF) bound together with NF 3 provides the main conclusions, which are validated on a prototypical organic charge-transfer complex (i.e., tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane, TTF-TCNQ).

Apparently, green analytical chemistry is a key part of green chemistry and an important trend in analytical chemistry in modern society. It is an emerging area of increasing importance both in green chemistry and in analytical chemistry. In this report, green analytical chemistry is systematically discussed and then defined with seven principles. Firstly, the aspects of green analytical chemistry are discussed in detail with regard to the whole analytical process; i.e., from sample collection, sample preparation, to sample analysis, and some other related issues such as process analysis. Secondly, some naturally green or possibly green analytical techniques are discussed. Presently, spectroscopic methods dominate the area of green analytical chemistry. The purpose of this report is to arouse more attention to green analytical chemistry to serve the sustainable development of the modern society.},

Since the parquet language provides a convenient way of characterizing all two-body vertices, the Baym-Kadanoff algorithm for generating a conserving two-body vertex takes a very straightforward form. We present the general theory and then illustrate the results using many of the simple conserving vertices. We then analyze the parquet two-body vertex within the theory, concluding that parquet is not a conserving theory. We show that any conserving theory that generates the direct parquet diagrams must also generate an infinite number of irreducible diagrams and derive integral equations for the minimal set of irreducible diagrams that would be needed in a conserving theory that produced the direct parquet diagrams. We present an algorithm that enables one to determine, for any direct or exchange parquet diagram, the parquet diagram whose contribution to the self-energy, when functionally differentiated, will generate the original parquet diagram. We then show that any set of diagrams for the two-body vertex that includes the bare interaction and satisfies the important properties of being conserving and antisymmetric under exchange of the outgoing particles must necessarily include all diagrams. {\textcopyright} 1992 The American Physical Society.},

While semi-empirical approximations to DFT result in a reduction in computational time versus ab initio DFT, creating such approximations involves significant manual intervention and is highly inefficient for high-throughput electronic structure screening calculations. In this letter, we propose the use of machine-learning for fast and accurate prediction of DFT Hamiltonians. Using suitable representations of atomic neighborhoods and Kernel Ridge Regression, we show that an accurate and transferable prediction of DFT Hamiltonians for a variety of material environments can be achieved. Electronic transmission spectra computed using predicted Hamiltonians compare accurately with their DFT counterparts. The method is independent of the specifics of the DFT basis or material system used and can easily be automated and scaled for predicting Hamiltonians of any material system of interest.},

In this work, we have implemented a computationally efficient GW approach that calculates central properties within the Matsubara-time domain using the modified version of elk, the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) package. Continuous-pole expansion (CPE), a recently proposed analytic continuation method, has been incorporated and compared to the widely used Pad{\'{e}} approximation. Full crystal symmetry has been employed for computational speedup. We have applied our approach to 18 well-studied semiconductors/insulators that cover a wide range of band gaps computed at the levels of single-shot G0W0, partially self-consistent GW0, and fully self-consistent GW (full-GW), in conjunction with the diagonal approximation. Our calculations show that G0W0 leads to band gaps that agree well with experiment for the case of simple s-p electron systems, whereas full-GW is required for improving the band gaps in 3d electron systems. In addition, GW0 almost always predicts larger band gap values compared to full-GW, likely due to the substantial underestimation of screening effects as well as the diagonal approximation. Both the CPE method and Pad{\'{e}} approximation lead to similar band gaps for most systems except strontium titantate, suggesting that further investigation into the latter approximation is necessary for strongly correlated systems. Moreover, the calculated cation d band energies suggest that both full-GW and GW0 lead to results in good agreement with experiment. Our computed band gaps serve as important benchmarks for the accuracy of the Matsubara-time GW approach.},

For instance, since the BSE reduces in second order to M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, it is self-interaction free in second order. Results for the correlation energy are compared with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks and excellent agreement is observed. For low densities, however, we find imaginary eigenmodes in the polarization propagator. To avoid the occurrence of imaginary eigenmodes, an approximation to the BSE kernel is proposed that allows us to completely remove this issue in the low-electron-density region.

To overcome the key storage bottlenecks we utilized (1) a low-rank tensor approximation (specifically, the singular value decomposition) to compress the wave function, and (2) explicitly correlated R12-type terms in the wave function to regularize the Coulomb electron-electron singularities of the Hamiltonian. All operations necessary to solve the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation were expressed so that the reconstruction of the full-rank form of the wave function is never necessary.

abstract = {A revised version of the well-established B97-D density functional approximation with general applicability for chemical properties of large systems is proposed. Like B97-D, it is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parametrized by including the standard D3 semi-classical dispersion correction. The orbitals are expanded in a modified valence triple-zeta Gaussian basis set, which is available for all elements up to Rn. Remaining basis set errors are mostly absorbed in the modified B97 parametrization, while an established atom-pairwise short-range potential is applied to correct for the systematically too long bonds of main group elements which are typical for most semi-local density functionals. The new composite scheme (termed B97-3c) completes the hierarchy of "low-cost" electronic structure methods, which are all mainly free of basis set superposition error and account for most interactions in a physically sound and asymptotically correct manner. B97-3c yields excellent molecular and condensed phase geometries, similar to most hybrid functionals evaluated in a larger basis set expansion. Results on the comprehensive GMTKN55 energy database demonstrate its good performance for main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and non-covalent interactions, when compared to functionals of the same class. This also transfers to metal-organic reactions, which is a major area of applicability for semi-local functionals. B97-3c can be routinely applied to hundreds of atoms on a single processor and we suggest it as a robust computational tool, in particular, for more strongly correlated systems where our previously published "3c" schemes might be problematic.},

abstract = {The recently developed domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) delivers results that are closely approaching those of the parent canonical coupled cluster method at a small fraction of the computational cost. A recent extended benchmark study established that, depending on the three main truncation thresholds, it is possible to approach the canonical CCSD(T) results within 1 kJ (default setting, TightPNO), 1 kcal/mol (default setting, NormalPNO), and 2-3 kcal (default setting, LoosePNO). Although thresholds for calculations with TightPNO are 2-4 times slower than those based on NormalPNO thresholds, they are still many orders of magnitude faster than canonical CCSD(T) calculations, even for small and medium sized molecules where there is little locality. The computational effort for the coupled cluster step scales nearly linearly with system size. Since, in many instances, the coupled cluster step in DLPNO-CCSD(T) is cheaper or at least not much more expensive than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, it is useful to compare the method against modern density functional theory (DFT), which requires an effort comparable to that of Hartree-Fock theory (at least if Hartree-Fock exchange is part of the functional definition). Double hybrid density functionals (DHDF's) even require a MP2-like step. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the cost vs accuracy ratio of DLPNO-CCSD(T) against modern DFT (including the PBE, B3LYP, M06-2X, B2PLYP, and B2GP-PLYP functionals and, where applicable, their van der Waals corrected counterparts). To eliminate any possible bias in favor of DLPNO-CCSD(T), we have chosen established benchmark sets that were specifically proposed for evaluating DFT functionals. It is demonstrated that DLPNO-CCSD(T) with any of the three default thresholds is more accurate than any of the DFT functionals. Furthermore, using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set and the LoosePNO default settings, DLPNO-CCSD(T) is only about 1.2 times slower than B3LYP. With NormalPNO thresholds, DLPNO-CCSD(T) is about a factor of 2 slower than B3LYP and shows a mean absolute deviation of less than 1 kcal/mol to the reference values for the four different data sets used. Our conclusion is that coupled cluster energies can indeed be obtained at near DFT cost.},

We apply this method to several archetypical examples of strong correlation, such as a H32 finite lattice that displays a highly multireference electronic ground state even at equilibrium lattice spacing. In all cases, GF2 gives a physically meaningful description of the metal to insulator transition in these systems, without resorting to spin-symmetry breaking.

In this paper we suggest a physically-sound matrix formulation to split electron correlation into dynamic and nondynamic parts using the two-particle cumulant matrix and a measure of the deviation from idempotency of the first-order density matrix. These matrices are applied to a two-electron model, giving rise to a simplified electron correlation index that (i) depends only on natural orbitals and their occupancies, (ii) can be straightforwardly decomposed into orbital contributions and (iii) splits into dynamic and nondynamic correlation parts that (iv) admit a local version. These expressions are shown to account for dynamic and nondynamic correlation in a variety of systems containing different electron correlation regimes, thus providing the first separation of dynamic and nondynamic correlation using solely natural orbital occupancies.},

abstract = {One way to reduce the computational cost of electronic structure calculations is to use auxiliary basis expansions to approximate four-center integrals in terms of two- and three-center integrals, usually by using the variationally optimum Coulomb metric to determine the expansion coefficients. However, the long-range decay behavior of the auxiliary basis expansion coefficients has not been characterized. We find that this decay can be surprisingly slow. Numerical experiments on linear alkanes and a toy model both show that the decay can be as slow as 1/r in the distance between the auxiliary function and the fitted charge distribution. The Coulomb metric fitting equations also involve divergent matrix elements for extended systems treated with periodic boundary conditions. An attenuated Coulomb metric that is short-range can eliminate these oddities without substantially degrading calculated relative energies. The sparsity of the fit coefficients is assessed on simple hydrocarbon molecules and shows quite early onset of linear growth in the number of significant coefficients with system size using the attenuated Coulomb metric. Hence it is possible to design linear scaling auxiliary basis methods without additional approximations to treat large systems.},

DCI takes the strengths of both theories to balance static and dynamic correlation in a single, fully ab initio embedding concept. The theory adds dynamic correlation around a fixed active space of orbitals with efficient O(N5) scaling, while maintaining a multireference treatment of the active space. We show that treating high-energy correlation up to the GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation level is sufficient even for challenging multireference problems. Our theory treats ground and excited states on equal footing, and we compute the dissociation curve of N2, the vertical excitation energies of small molecules, and the ionization spectrum of benzene in excellent agreement with high-level quantum chemistry methods and experiment.},

We show that also excitations of deep valence, semi-core and unbound states match conventional schemes within 0.1 eV. The high accuracy is achieved by using minimax grids with 30 grid points and the resolution of the identity with the truncated Coulomb metric. We apply the low-scaling GW algorithm with improved accuracy to phosphorene nanosheets of increasing size. We find that their fundamental gap is strongly size-dependent varying from 4.0 eV (1.8 nm × 1.3 nm, 88 atoms) to 2.4 eV (6.9 nm × 4.8 nm, 990 atoms) at the evGW0@PBE level.},

These methods present a priori predictions of the absorption and linear dichroism spectra and include protein electrostatic effects, short range inductive effects, long-range and short-range exciton couplings, and superexchange effects involving aromatic residues and carotenes.

abstract = {Recently, a new type of orbital-dependent functional for the Kohn-Sham (KS) correlation energy, $\sigma$-functionals, was introduced. Technically, $\sigma$-functionals are closely related to the well-known direct random phase approximation (dRPA). Within the dRPA, a function of the eigenvalues $\sigma$ of the frequency-dependent KS response function is integrated over purely imaginary frequencies. In $\sigma$-functionals, this function is replaced by one that is optimized with respect to reference sets of atomization, reaction, transition state, and non-covalent interaction energies. The previously introduced $\sigma$-functional uses input orbitals and eigenvalues from KS calculations with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). Here, $\sigma$-functionals using input orbitals and eigenvalues from the meta-GGA TPSS and the hybrid-functionals PBE0 and B3LYP are presented and tested. The number of reference sets taken into account in the optimization of the $\sigma$-functionals is larger than in the first PBE based $\sigma$-functional and includes sets with 3d-transition metal compounds. Therefore, also a reparameterized PBE based $\sigma$-functional is introduced. The $\sigma$-functionals based on PBE0 and B3LYP orbitals and eigenvalues reach chemical accuracy for main group chemistry. For the 10 966 reactions from the highly accurate W4-11RE reference set, the B3LYP based $\sigma$-functional exhibits a mean average deviation of 1.03 kcal/mol compared to 1.08 kcal/mol for the coupled cluster singles doubles perturbative triples method if the same valence quadruple zeta basis set is used. For 3d-transition metal chemistry, accuracies of about 2 kcal/mol are reached. The computational effort for the post-self-consistent evaluation of the $\sigma$-functional is lower than that of a preceding PBE0 or B3LYP calculation for typical systems.},

This approach makes explicit use of the diagrammatic perturbation expansion for the polarization propagator, and reformulates the exact summation in terms of a simple algebraic scheme, referred to as the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC). The ADC defines in a natural way a set of approximation schemes (nth-order ADC schemes) which represent infinite partial summations exact up to nth order of perturbation theory. In contrast to the random-phase-approximation (RPA)-like schemes, the corresponding mathematical procedures are essentially Hermitian eigenvalue problems in limited configuration spaces of unperturbed excited configurations. Explicit equations for the first- and second-order ADC schemes are derived. These schemes are thoroughly discussed and compared with the Tamm-Dancoff approximation and RPA schemes. {\textcopyright} 1982 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A number of consequences of the presence of the exchange-correlation hole potential in the Kohn-Sham potential are elucidated. One consequence is that the HOMO-LUMO orbital energy difference in the KS-DFT model (the KS gap) is not "underestimated" or even "wrong", but that it is physically expected to be an approximation to the excitation energy if electrons and holes are close, and numerically proves to be so rather accurately. It is physically not an approximation to the difference between ionization energy and electron affinity I - A (fundamental gap or chemical hardness) and also numerically differs considerably from this quantity. The KS virtual orbitals do not possess the notorious diffuseness of the Hartree-Fock virtual orbitals, they often describe excited states much more closely as simple orbital transitions. The Hartree-Fock model does yield an approximation to I - A as the HOMO-LUMO orbital energy difference (in Koopmans' frozen orbital approximation), if the anion is bound, which is often not the case. We stress the spurious nature of HF LUMOs if the orbital energy is positive. One may prefer Hartree-Fock, or mix Hartree-Fock and (approximate) KS operators to obtain a HOMO-LUMO gap as a Koopmans' approximation to I - A (in cases where A exists). That is a different one-electron model, which exists in its own right. But it is not an "improvement" of the KS model, it necessarily deteriorates the (approximate) excitation energy property of the KS gap in molecules, and deteriorates the good shape of the KS virtual orbitals. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Owner Societies.},

@article{Penfold2018,
abstract = {Intersystem crossing (ISC), formally forbidden within nonrelativistic quantum theory, is the mechanism by which a molecule changes its spin state. It plays an important role in the excited state decay dynamics of many molecular systems and not just those containing heavy elements. In the simplest case, ISC is driven by direct spin-orbit coupling between two states of different multiplicities. This coupling is usually assumed to remain unchanged by vibrational motion. It is also often presumed that spin-allowed radiationless transitions, i.e. internal conversion, and the nonadiabatic coupling that drives them, can be considered separately from ISC and spin-orbit coupling owing to the vastly different time scales upon which these processes are assumed to occur. However, these assumptions are too restrictive. Indeed, the strong mixing brought about by the simultaneous presence of nonadiabatic and spin-orbit coupling means that often the spin, electronic, and vibrational dynamics cannot be described independently. Instead of considering a simple ladder of states, as depicted in a Jablonski diagram, one must consider the more complicated spin-vibronic levels. Despite the basic ideas being outlined in the 1960s, it is only with the advent of high-level theory and femtosecond spectroscopy that the importance of the spin-vibronic mechanism for ISC in both fundamental as well as applied research fields has been revealed with significant impact across chemistry, physics, and biology. In this review article, we present the theory and fundamental principles of the spin-vibronic mechanism for ISC. This is followed by empirical rules to estimate the rate of ISC within this regime. The most recent developments in experimental techniques, theoretical methods, and models for the spin-vibronic mechanism are discussed. These concepts are subsequently illustrated with examples, including the ISC mechanisms in transition metal complexes, small organic molecules, and organic chromophores.},

abstract = {We derive rigorous multipole-based integral estimates (MBIE) in order to account for the distance dependence occurring in atomic-orbital (AO) formulations of electron correlation theory, where our focus is on AO-MP2 theory within a Laplace scheme. We find for the exact transformed integral products an extremely early onset of a linear-scaling behavior and a very small number of significant products. To preselect the significant integral products we adapt our MBIE method as rigorous upper bound. In this way it is possible to exploit the favorable scaling behavior observed and to reduce the scaling of estimated products asymptotically to linear, without sacrificing accuracy or reliability. By separating Coulomb- and exchange-type contractions only half-transformed integrals need to be computed. Furthermore, our scheme of rigorously preselecting transformed integral products via MBIE seems to offer particularly interesting perspectives for a direct formation of half- or fully transformed integrals by using multipole expansions and auxiliary basis sets.},

abstract = {Quasiparticle (QP) excitations are extremely important for understanding and predicting charge transfer and transport in molecules, nanostructures, and extended systems. Since density functional theory (DFT) within the Kohn-Sham (KS) formulation does not provide reliable QP energies, many-body perturbation techniques such as the GW approximation are essential. The main practical drawback of GW implementations is the high computational scaling with system size, prohibiting its use in extended, open boundary systems with many dozens of electrons or more. Recently, a stochastic formulation of GW (sGW) was presented (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2014, 113, 076402) with a near-linear-scaling complexity, illustrated for a series of silicon nanocrystals reaching systems of more than 3000 electrons. This advance provides a route for many-body calculations on very large systems that were impossible with previous approaches. While earlier we have shown the gentle scaling of sGW, its accuracy was not extensively demonstrated. Therefore, we show that this new sGW approach is very accurate by calculating the ionization energies of a group of sufficiently small molecules where a comparison to other GW codes is still possible. Using a set of 10 such molecules, we demonstrate that sGW provides reliable vertical ionization energies in close agreement with benchmark deterministic GW results (J. Chem. Theory Comput, 2015, 11, 5665), with mean (absolute) deviation of 0.05 and 0.09 eV. For completeness, we also provide a detailed review of the sGW theory and numerical implementation.},

The OO-MP2 isotropic hfccs for a series of small radicals are almost of CCSD quality but are obtained with iterative O (N⁵) effort. The dipolar hfccs are less well predicted by the OO-MP2 methods, whereas spin-component scaling improves the description of the hyperfine structure. The spin contamination in the OO-MP2 wave function is drastically reduced compared to the standard unrestricted Hartree-Fock wave function. The applicability of the OO-MP2 to fairly large systems is demonstrated for the solvated p-benzosemiquinone radical anion, where calculations with almost 2000 basis functions have been performed.},

We show that many operations, including convolutions, Fourier transforms, and the solution of the Dyson equation, can straightforwardly be expressed in terms of the series expansion coefficients.

The origin can be traced back to the structural difference in the CD helix.

In this work we remedy this situation by including a simple vertex correction that is consistent with a local-density approximation starting point. We analyze the effect of the self-energy by splitting it into short-range and long-range terms which are shown to govern, respectively, the center and size of the band gap. The vertex mainly improves the short-range correlations and therefore has a small effect on the band gap, while it shifts the band gap center up in energy by around 0.5 eV, in good agreement with experiments. Our analysis also explains how the relative importance of short- and long-range interactions in structures of different dimensionality is reflected in their QP energies. Inclusion of the vertex comes at practically no extra computational cost and even improves the basis set convergence compared to GW. Taken together, the method provides an efficient and rigorous improvement over the GW approximation.},

In addition, the WCCR10 test set, which comprises ten reactions, is revisited, and reaction energies for the reaction of a $\mu$-chloride-bridged palladacyclic dimer with phosphane ligands are presented. RPA yields results that are on average within 2–3 kcal/mol of the theoretical benchmark with a maximum deviation of 5 kcal/mol.

It is demonstrated that counterpoise-corrected SOS-MP2 results, extrapolated towards the complete basis set (CBS) limit using a two-point extrapolation scheme, can yield association energies that are reasonably close to the best available numbers, when the single scale factor is chosen as 1.55 for extrapolating results at the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ levels.

Partial inclusion of these corrections leads to very different band gaps.

The theory shows what functions should be added to the basis set to improve the rate of convergence, and gives explicit formulas for estimating corrections to variational energies and wave functions. An application of this general theory to a CI calculation on the ground state of the helium atom yields an explicit large L asymptotic formula for the "L"-limit energies EL. The increments are found to obey the formula EL- EL-1= - 3C1(L + 1/2)-4- 4C2(L + 1/2)-5+ O (L-6) where the constants C1and C2are given by explicit integrals over the exact wave function evaluated at r12= 0.

abstract = {Live-coding is defined as "the process of designing and implementing a [coding] project in front of class during lecture period"[5]. In this article we present our research design and results regarding the effectiveness of live-coding to teach introductory programming. The research design includes two experimental groups spread across four sections of an introductory C++ course at Colorado School of Mines. In the control group, students were taught using static code, meaning that instructors never typed, but instead viewed, compiled, and executed code examples. In the experimental or "live-coding" group, instructors started each lecture with a blank screen, and taught code examples by systematically typing, compiling, and testing code to solve example problems. To assess the effectiveness of live-coding, we administered four surveys and analyzed final grades. Two of the surveys were given at the beginning of the course, and were used to measure baseline programming knowledge and student learning preferences (i.e., VARK [2]). The other two surveys, given at the end of the course, were designed to measure the amount of programming knowledge obtained as well as preferences towards live coding. Lastly, final grades were analyzed in terms of its subcomponents: the assignments, exams, final project, and overall grade. Based on our results, we conclude that teaching via live-coding is as good as if not better than using static code examples. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {Activation barriers and reaction energetics for the three main classes of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, including nine different reactions, were evaluated with the MPW1K and B3LYP density functional methods, MP2, and the multicomponent CBS-QB3 method. The CBS-QB3 values were used as standards for 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition activation barriers and reaction energetics, and the density functional theory (DFT) and MP2 methods were benchmarked against these values. The MPW1K/6-31G* method and basis set performs best for activation barriers, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) value of 1.1 kcal/mol. The B3LYP/6-31G* method and basis set performs best for reaction enthalpies, with a MAD value of 2.4 kcal/mol, while the MPW1K method shows large errors for reaction energetics. The MP2 method gives the expected systematic underestimation of barriers. Concerted and nearly synchronous transition structures are predicted by all DFT and MP2 methods. Also reported are revised estimated 0 K experimental activation enthalpies for a standard set of hydrocarbon pericyclic reactions and updated comparisons to experiment for DFT, ab initio, and multicomponent methods. B3LYP and MPW1K methods with MAD values of 1.5 and 2.1 kcal/mol, respectively, fortuitously outperform the multicomponent CBS-QB3 method, which has a MAD value of 2.3. The MAD value of the O3LYP functional improves to 2.4 kcal/mol from the previously reported 3.0 kcal/mol. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Dyson orbitals, their electron-binding energies, and probability factors provide descriptions of electrons in molecules that are experimentally verifiable and that generalize qualitatively useful concepts of uncorrelated, molecular-orbital theory to the exact limit of Schr{\"{o}}dinger's time-independent equation. Dyson orbitals are defined as overlaps between initial, N-electron states and final states with N ± 1 electrons and therefore are useful in the prediction and interpretation of many kinds of spectroscopic and scattering experiments. They also are characteristic of N-electron initial states and may be used to construct electron densities, one-electron properties, and total energies with correlated Aufbau procedures that include probability factors between zero and unity. Relationships with natural orbitals, Kohn-Sham orbitals, and Hartree-Fock orbitals facilitate insights into the descriptive capabilities of Dyson orbitals. Electron-propagator approximations that employ the Dyson quasiparticle equation or super-operator secular equations enable direct determination of Dyson orbitals and obviate the need for many-electron wavefunctions of initial or final states. Numerical comparisons of the amplitudes and probability factors of Dyson orbitals calculated with several self-energy approximations reveal the effects of electron correlation on these uniquely defined, one-electron wavefunctions.},

abstract = {We study the carbon-dimer defect in a hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) monolayer using the GW and Bethe-Salpeter many-body perturbation theories within a finite-size cluster approach. While quasiparticle energies converge very slowly with system size due to missing long-range polarization effects, optical excitations converge much faster, with a 1/R 3 scaling law with respect to cluster average radius. We obtain a luminescence zero-phonon energy of 4.36 eV, including significant 0.13 eV zero-point vibrational energy and 0.15 eV reorganization energy contributions. Interlayer screening decreases further the emission energy by about 0.3 eV. These results bring support to the recent identification of the substitutional carbon dimer as the likely source of the zero-phonon 4.1 eV luminescence line. Finally, the GW quasiparticle energies are extrapolated to the infinite h-BN monolayer limit, leading to a predicted defect highest occupied molecular orbital to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital photoemission gap of 7.6 eV. Comparison with the optical gap yields a very large excitonic binding energy of 3 eV for the associated localized Frenkel exciton.},

In particular we measure the scaling behavior of the sample variance and probe whether this stochastic approach is competitive if accuracies well below 1 meV per valence orbital are required, as it is necessary for calculations of adsorption, binding, or surface energies. The algorithm is based on the Laplace transformed MP2 (LTMP2) formulation in the plane wave basis. The time-dependent Hartree-Fock orbitals, appearing in the LTMP2 formulation, are stochastically rotated in the occupied and unoccupied Hilbert space. This avoids a full summation over all combinations of occupied and unoccupied orbitals, as inspired by the work of D. Neuhauser, E. Rabani, and R. Baer in J. Chem. Theory Comput. 9, 24 (2013). Additionally, correlated sampling is introduced, accelerating the statistical convergence significantly.},

We show that the imaginary frequency grids developed for second order also perform well for the correlation energy in the direct random phase approximation. Furthermore, we show that the polarizabilities on the imaginary time axis can be Fourier-transformed to the imaginary frequency domain, since the time and frequency Minimax grids are dual to each other. The same duality is observed for the least-squares grids.

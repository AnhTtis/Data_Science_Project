    "abstract": "In this paper, we first obtain a refined version of the Bohr inequality of norm-type for holomorphic mappings with lacunary series on the polydisk in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ under some restricted conditions. Next, we determine the refined version of the Bohr inequality for holomorphic functions defined on a balanced domain $ G $ of a complex Banach space $ X $ and take values from the unit disk $ \\mathbb{D} $. Furthermore, as a consequence of one of this results, we obtain a refined version of the Bohr-type inequalities for harmonic functions $ f=h+\\bar{g} $ defined on a balanced domain $ G\\subset X $. All the results are proved to be sharp.",

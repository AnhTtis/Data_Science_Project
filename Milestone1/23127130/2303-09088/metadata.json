    "abstract": "Deep learning based methods provide efficient solutions to medical image registration, including the challenging problem of diffeomorphic image registration. However, most methods register normal image pairs, facing difficulty handling those with missing correspondences, e.g., in the presence of pathology like tumors. We desire an efficient solution to jointly account for spatial deformations and appearance changes in the pathological regions where the correspondences are missing, i.e., finding a solution to metamorphic image registration. Some approaches are proposed to tackle this problem, but they cannot properly handle large pathological regions and deformations around pathologies. In this paper, we propose a deep metamorphic image registration network (MetaRegNet), which adopts time-varying flows to drive spatial diffeomorphic deformations and generate intensity variations. We evaluate MetaRegNet on two datasets, i.e., BraTS 2021 with brain tumors and 3D-IRCADb-01 with liver tumors, showing promising results in registering a healthy and tumor image pair. The source code is available online.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we study the topological Hochschild homology of $\\mathbf{E}_3$-forms of truncated Brown-Peterson spectra, taken relative to certain Thom spectra $X(p^n)$ (introduced by Ravenel and used by Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith in the proof of the nilpotence theorem). We prove analogues of Bökstedt's calculations $\\mathrm{THH}(\\mathbf{F}_p) \\simeq \\mathbf{F}_p[ΩS^3]$ and $\\mathrm{THH}(\\mathbf{Z}_p) \\simeq \\mathbf{Z}_p[ΩS^3\\langle{3}\\rangle]$. We also construct a topological analogue of the Sen operator of Bhatt-Lurie-Drinfeld, and study a higher chromatic extension. The behavior of these \"topological Sen operators\" is dictated by differentials in the Serre spectral sequence for Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer fibrations.",

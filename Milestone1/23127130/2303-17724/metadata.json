    "abstract": "We present a method to simulate ultrafast pump-probe time-resolved circular dichroism (TRCD) spectra based on time-dependent density functional theory trajectory surface hopping. The method is applied to simulate the TRCD spectrum along the photoinduced ring-opening of provitamin D. Simulations reveal that the initial decay of the signal is due to excited state relaxation, forming the rotationally flexible previtamin D. We further show that oscillations in the experimental TRCD spectrum arise from isomerizations between previtamin D rotamers with different chirality, which are associated with the helical conformation of the triene unit. We give a detailed description of the formation dynamics of different rotamers, playing a key role in the natural regulation vitamin D photosynthesis. Going beyond the sole extraction of decay rates, simulations greatly increase the amount of information that can be retrieved from ultrafast TRCD, making it a sensitive tool to unravel details in the sub-picosecond dynamics of photoinduced chirality changes.",

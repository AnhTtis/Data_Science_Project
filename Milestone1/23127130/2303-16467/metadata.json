    "abstract": "A $k$-transversal to family of sets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is a $k$-dimensional affine subspace that intersects each set of the family. In 1957 Hadwiger provided a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of pairwise disjoint, planar convex sets to have a $1$-transversal. After a series of three papers among the authors Goodman, Pollack, and Wenger from 1988 to 1990, Hadwiger's Theorem was extended to necessary and sufficient conditions for $(d-1)$-transversals to finite families of convex sets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with no disjointness condition on the family of sets. However, no such conditions for a finite family of convex sets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to have a $k$-transversal for $0<k<d-1$ has previously been proven or conjectured. We make progress in this direction by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite family of convex sets in $\\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ to have a $(2d-2)$-transversal.",

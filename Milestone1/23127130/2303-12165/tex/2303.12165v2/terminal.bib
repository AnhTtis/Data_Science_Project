abstract = {Spectral analysis of hot luminous stars requires adequate model atmospheres which take into account the effects of NLTE and radiation driven winds properly. Here we present significant improvements of our approach in constructing detailed atmospheric models and synthetic spectra for hot luminous stars. Moreover, as we regard our solution method in its present stage already as a standard procedure, we make our program package WM-basic available to the community (download is possible from the URL given below). The most important model improvements towards a realistic description of stationary wind models concern: (i) A sophisticated and consistent description of line blocking and blanketing. Our solution concept to this problem renders the line blocking influence on the ionizing fluxes emerging from the atmospheres of hot stars - mainly the spectral ranges of the EUV and the UV are affected - in identical quality as the synthetic high resolution spectra representing the observable region. In addition, the line blanketing effect is properly accounted for in the energy balance. (ii) The atomic data archive which has been improved and enhanced considerably, providing the basis for a detailed multilevel NLTE treatment of the metal ions (from C to Zn) and an adequate representation of line blocking and the radiative line acceleration. (iii) A revised inclusion of EUV and X-ray radiation produced by cooling zones which originate from the simulation of shock heated matter. This new tool not only provides an easy-to-use method for O-star diagnostics, whereby physical constraints on the properties of stellar winds, stellar parameters, and abundances can be obtained via a comparison of observed and synthetic spectra, but also allows the astrophysically important information about the ionizing fluxes of hot stars to be determined automatically. Results illustrating this are discussed by means of a basic model grid calculated for O-stars with solar metallicity. To further demonstrate the astrophysical potential of our new method, we first provide a detailed spectral diagnostic determination of the stellar parameters, the wind parameters, and the abundances by an exemplary application to one of our grid-stars, the O9.5Ia O-supergiant $\alpha$ Cam. Our abundance determinations of the light elements indicate that these deviate considerably from the solar values.},

abstract = {We present the first automated fitting method for the quantitative spectroscopy of O- and early B-type stars with stellar winds. The method combines the non-LTE stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND from Puis et al. (2005, A{\&}A, 435, 669) with the genetic algorithm based optimization routine PIKAIA from Charbonneau (1995, ApJS, 101, 309), allowing for a homogeneous analysis of upcoming large samples of early-type stars (e.g. Evans et al. 2005, A{\&}A, 437, 467). In this first implementation we use continuum normalized optical hydrogen and helium lines to determine photospheric and wind parameters. We have assigned weights to these lines accounting for line blends with species not taken into account, lacking physics, and/or possible or potential problems in the model atmosphere code. We find the method to be robust, fast, and accurate. Using our method we analysed seven O-type stars in the young cluster Cyg OB2 and five other Galactic stars with high rotational velocities and/or low mass loss rates (including 10 Lac, $\zeta$ Oph, and $\tau$ Sco) that have been studied in detail with a previous version of FASTWIND. The fits are found to have a quality that is comparable or even better than produced by the classical "by eye" method. We define errorbars on the model parameters based on the maximum variations of these parameters in the models that cluster around the global optimum. Using this concept, for the investigated dataset we are able to recover mass-loss rates down to ∼6 × 10-8 M ⊙ yr-1 to within an error of a factor of two, ignoring possible systematic errors due to uncertainties in the continuum normalization. Comparison of our derived spectroscopic masses with those derived from stellar evolutionary models are in very good agreement, i.e. based on the limited sample that we have studied we do not find indications for a mass discrepancy. For three stars we find significantly higher surface gravities than previously reported. We identify this to be due to differences in the weighting of Balmer line wings between our automated method and "by eye" fitting and/or an improved multidimensional optimization of the parameters. The empirical modified wind momentum relation constructed on the basis of the stars analysed here agrees to within the error bars with the theoretical relation predicted by Vink et al. (2000, A{\&}A, 362, 295), including those cases for which the winds are weak (i.e. less than a few times 10-7 M ⊙ yr-1). {\textcopyright} ESO 2005.},

abstract = {Context. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray radiation emitted from wind-embedded shocks in hot, massive stars can affect the ionization balance in their outer atmospheres and can be the mechanism responsible for producing highly ionized atomic species detected in stellar wind UV spectra. Aims. To allow for these processes in the context of spectral analysis, we have implemented the emission from wind-embedded shocks and related physics into our unified, NLTE model atmosphere/spectrum synthesis code FASTWIND. Methods. The shock structure and corresponding emission is calculated as a function of user-supplied parameters (volume filling factor, radial stratification of shock strength, and radial onset of emission). We account for a temperature and density stratification inside the postshock cooling zones, calculated for radiative and adiabatic cooling in the inner and outer wind, respectively. The high-energy absorption of the cool wind is considered by adding important K-shell opacities, and corresponding Auger ionization rates have been included in the NLTE network. To test our implementation and to check the resulting effects, we calculated a comprehensive model grid with a variety of X-ray emission parameters. Results. We tested and verified our implementation carefully against corresponding results from various alternative model atmosphere codes, and studied the effects from shock emission for important ions from He, C, N, O, Si, and P. Surprisingly, dielectronic recombination turned out to play an essential role for the ionization balance of O iv/O v (particularly in dwarfs with Teff{\~{}} 45 000 K). Finally, we investigated the frequency dependence and radial behavior of the mass absorption coefficient, $\kappa$$\nu$(r), which is important in the context of X-ray line formation in massive star winds. Conclusions. In almost all of the cases considered, direct ionization is of major influence because of the enhanced EUV radiation field, and Auger ionization only affects N vi and O vi significantly. The approximation of a radially constant $\kappa$$\nu$ is justified for r ≳ 1.2 R and $\lambda$ ≲ 18 {\AA} and also for many models at longer wavelengths. To estimate the actual value of this quantity, however, the He ii opacities need to be calculated from detailed NLTE modeling, at least for wavelengths longer than 18 to 20 {\AA}, and information on the individual CNO abundances has to be present.},

@article{MacLow2004,
abstract = {Observations have suggested substantial departures from pressure equilibrium in the interstellar medium (ISM) in the plane of the Galaxy, even on scales under 50 pc. Nevertheless, multiphase models of the ISM assume at least locally isobaric gas. The pressure then determines the density reached by gas cooling to stable thermal equilibrium. We use numerical models of the magnetized ISM to examine the consequences of supernova driving for interstellar pressures. In this paper we examine a (200 pc)3 periodic domain threaded by magnetic fields. Individual parcels of gas at different pressures reach widely varying points on the thermal equilibrium curve: no unique set of phases is found but rather a dynamically determined continuum of densities and temperatures. A substantial fraction of the gas remains entirely out of thermal equilibrium. Our results appear consistent with observations of interstellar pressures. They also suggest that the high pressures observed in molecular clouds may be due to ram pressures in addition to gravitational forces. Much of the gas in our model lies far from equipartition between thermal and magnetic pressures, with ratios ranging from 0.1 to 104 and ratios of uniform to fluctuating magnetic field of 0.5-1. Our models show broad pressure probability distribution functions with log-normal functional forms produced by both shocks and rarefaction waves rather than power-law distributions produced by isolated supernova remnants. The width of the distribution can be described quantitatively by a formula derived from the work of Padoan, Nordlund, {\&} Jones. {\textcopyright} 2005. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {Context. The evolutionary state of blue supergiants is still unknown. Stellar wind mass loss is one of the dominant processes determining the evolution of massive stars, and it may provide clues to the evolutionary properties of blue supergiants. As the H$\alpha$ line is the most oft-used mass-loss tracer in the OB-star regime, we investigate H$\alpha$ line formation as a function of Teff. Aims. We provide a detailed analysis of the H$\alpha$ line for OB supergiant models over an Teff range between 30 000 and 12 500 K, with the aim of understanding the mass-loss properties of blue supergiants. Methods. We model the H$\alpha$ line using the non-LTE code cmfgen, in the context of the bi-stability jump at Teff {\~{}} 22 500 K. Results. We find a maximum in the H$\alpha$ equivalent width at 22 500 K exactly at the location of the bi-stability jump. The H$\alpha$ line-profile behaviour is characterised by two branches of effective temperature: (i) a hot branch between 30 000 and 22 500 K, where H$\alpha$ emission becomes stronger with decreasing Teff; and (ii) a cool branch between 22 500 and 12 500 K, where the H$\alpha$ line becomes weaker. Our models show that this non-monotonic H$\alpha$ behaviour is related to the optical depth of Ly$\alpha$, finding that at the "cool" branch the population of the 2nd level of hydrogen is enhanced in comparison to the 3rd level. This is expected to increase line absorption, leading to weaker H$\alpha$ flux when Teff drops from 22 500 K downwards. We also show that for late B supergiants (at Teff below {\~{}}15 000 K), the differences in the H$\alpha$ line between homogeneous and clumpy winds becomes insignificant. Moreover, we show that, at the bi-stability jump, H$\alpha$ changes its character completely, from an optically thin to an optically thick line, implying that macro-clumping should play an important role at temperatures below the bi-stability jump. This would not only have consequences for the character of observed H$\alpha$ line profiles, but also for the reported discrepancies between theoretical and empirical mass-loss rates. {\textcopyright} 2014 ESO.},

abstract = {The authors describe results of numerical radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the nonlinear evolution of instabilities in radiatively driven stellar winds. The wind is idealized as a spherically symmetric, isothermal flow driven by pure absorption of stellar radiation in a fixed ensemble of spectral lines. The simulations indicate that there is a strong tendency for the unstable flow to form rather sharp rarefactions in which the highest speed material has very low density. The growth of wave perturbations thus remains nearly exponential well beyond the linear regime, until the waves are kinematically steepened into strong shocks. The strongest shocks here are reverse shocks that arise to decelerate high-speed, rarefied flow as it impacts slower material that has been compressed into dense shells. The subsequent wind evolution shows a slow decay of the shocks and the gradual thermal decompression and interaction of the dense shells.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of how best to correct astronomical data for the wavelength-dependent effects of Galactic interstellar extinction. The main general features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along with the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of extinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral region, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the wavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between extinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships provide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction. Several strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the uncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the wavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR through the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction law varies with the parameter R = A(V)/E(B-V). These curves represent the true monochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable for dereddening IR--UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution, and can be used to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.},

@article{Sundqvist2009,
abstract = {Context. The mass-loss rate is a key parameter of hot, massive stars. Small-scale inhomogeneities (clumping) in the winds of these stars are conventionally included in spectral analyses by assuming optically thin clumps, a void inter-clump medium, and a smooth velocity field. To reconcile investigations of different diagnostics (in particular, unsaturated UV resonance lines vs. H$\alpha$ radio emission) within such models, a highly clumped wind with very low mass-loss rates needs to be invoked, where the resonance lines seem to indicate rates an order of magnitude (or even more) lower than previously accepted values. If found to be realistic, this would challenge the radiative line-driven wind theory and have dramatic consequences for the evolution of massive stars. Aims. We investigate basic properties of the formation of resonance lines in small-scale inhomogeneous hot star winds with non-monotonic velocity fields. Methods. We study inhomogeneous wind structures by means of 2D stochastic and pseudo-2D radiation-hydrodynamic wind models, constructed by assembling 1D snapshots in radially independent slices. A Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, which treats the resonance line formation in an axially symmetric spherical wind (without resorting to the Sobolev approximation), is presented and used to produce synthetic line spectra. Results. The optically thin clumping limit is only valid for very weak lines. The detailed density structure, the inter-clump medium, and the non-monotonic velocity field are all important for the line formation. We confirm previous findings that radiation-hydrodynamic wind models reproduce observed characteristics of strong lines (e.g., the black troughs) without applying the highly supersonic "microturbulence" needed in smooth models. For intermediate strong lines, the velocity spans of the clumps are of central importance. Current radiation-hydrodynamic models predict spans that are too large to reproduce observed profiles unless a very low mass-loss rate is invoked. By simulating lower spans in 2D stochastic models, the profile strengths become drastically reduced, and are consistent with higher mass-loss rates. To simultaneously meet the constraints from strong lines, the inter-clump medium must be non-void. A first comparison to the observed Phosphorus V doublet in the O6 supergiant $\lambda$ Cep confirms that line profiles calculated from a stochastic 2D model reproduce observations with a mass-loss rate approximately ten × higher than that derived from the same lines but assuming optically thin clumping. Tentatively this may resolve discrepancies between theoretical predictions, evolutionary constraints, and recent derived mass-loss rates, and suggests a re-investigation of the clump structure predicted by current radiation-hydrodynamic models. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2010.},

abstract = {Mass loss is a key process in the evolution of massive stars, and must be understood quantitatively to be successfully included in broader astrophysical applications. In this review, we discuss various aspects of radiation driven mass loss, both from the theoretical and the observational side. We focus on winds from OB-stars, with some excursions to the Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf- Rayet stars, A-supergiants and Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae. After reca- pitulating the 1-D, stationary standard model of line-driven wind, extensions accounting for rotation and magnetic fields are discussed. The relevance of the so-called bi-stability jump is outlined. We summarize diagnostical methods to infer wind properties from observations, and compare the results with theore- tical predictions, featuring the massloss-metallicity dependence. Subsequently, we concentrate on two urgent problems which challenge our present understanding of radiation driven winds: weak winds and wind- clumping. We discuss problems of measuring mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of NIR- spectroscopy. Wind-clumping has severe implications for the interpretation of observational diagnostics, as derived mass-loss rates can be overestimated by factors of 2 to 10 if clumping is ignored, and we describe ongoing attempts to allow for more uniform results. We point out that independent arguments from stellar evolution favor a moderate reduction of present- day mass-loss rates. We also consider larger scale wind structure, interpreted in terms of co-rotating interacting regions, and complete this review with a discussion of recent progress on the X-ray line emission from massive stars, highlighting as to how far the analysis of such X-ray line emission can give further clues regarding an adequate description of wind clumping.

Unambiguous constraints on the fraction of massive stars affected by binary interaction were lacking. We simultaneously measured all relevant binary characteristics in a sample of Galactic massive O stars and quantified the frequency and nature of binary interactions. Over seventy per cent of all massive stars will exchange mass with a companion, leading to a binary merger in one third of the cases. These numbers greatly exceed previous estimates and imply that binary interaction dominates the evolution of massive stars, with implications for populations of massive stars and their supernovae.},

abstract = {The high ionization level and nonzero metallicity ({\~{}}1{\%} Z☉) of the intergalactic gas at redshifts z 5 implies that nonlinear structure had started to form in the universe at earlier times than we currently probe. In cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies, the first generation of baryonic objects emerges at redshifts z {\~{}} 10-50. Here we examine the observable consequences of the possibility that an early generation of stars reionized the universe and resulted in the observed metallicity of the Ly$\alpha$ forest. Forthcoming microwave anisotropy experiments will be sensitive to the damping of anisotropies caused by scattering off free electrons from the reionization epoch. For a large range of CDM models with a Scalo stellar mass function, we find that reionization occurs at a redshift z 10 and damps the amplitude of anisotropies on angular scales 10° by a detectable amount, {\~{}}10{\%}-25{\%}. However, reionization is substantially delayed if the initial stellar mass function transformed most of the baryons into low-mass stars. In this case, the mass fraction of pregalactic stars could be constrained from the statistics of microlensing events in galactic halos or along lines of sight to quasars. Deep infrared imaging with future space telescopes (such as the Space Infrared Telescope Facility or the Next Generation Space Telescope) will be able to detect bright star clusters at z 5. The cumulative bremsstrahlung emission from these star clusters yields a measurable distortion to the spectrum of the microwave background.},

abstract = {Context. The Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is our closest view of a starburst region and is the ideal environment to investigate important questions regarding the formation, evolution and final fate of the most massive stars. Aims. We analyze the multiplicity properties of the massive O-type star population observed through multi-epoch spectroscopy in the framework of the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey. With 360 O-type stars, this is the largest homogeneous sample of massive stars analyzed to date. Methods. We use multi-epoch spectroscopy and variability analysis to identify spectroscopic binaries. We also use a Monte-Carlo method to correct for observational biases. By modeling simultaneously the observed binary fraction, the distributions of the amplitudes of the radial velocity variations and the distribution of the time scales of these variations, we constrain the intrinsic current binary fraction and period and mass-ratio distributions. Results.We observe a spectroscopic binary fraction of 0:35±0.03, which corresponds to the fraction of objects displaying statistically significant radial velocity variations with an amplitude of at least 20 km s-1.We compute the intrinsic binary fraction to be 0.51±0:04. We adopt power-laws to describe the intrinsic period and mass-ratio distributions: f (log10 P=d) ∼ (log10 P=d)$\pi$ (with log10 P=d in the range 0.15-3.5) and f (q) ∼ q$\kappa$ with 0.1 ≤ q = M2=M1 {\textless} 1.0. The power-law indexes that best reproduce the observed quantities are $\pi$ = -0.45 ± 0.30 and $\kappa$ = -1.0 ± 0.4. The period distribution that we obtain thus favours shorter period systems compared to an {\"{O}}pik law ($\pi$ = 0). The mass ratio distribution is slightly skewed towards low mass ratio systems but remains incompatible with a random sampling of a classical mass function ($\kappa$ = -2.35). The binary fraction seems mostly uniform across the field of view and independent of the spectral types and luminosity classes. The binary fraction in the outer region of the field of view (r {\textgreater} 7.8', i.e. ≈117 pc) and among the O9.7 I/II objects are however significantly lower than expected from statistical fluctuations. The observed and intrinsic binary fractions are also lower for the faintest objects in our sample (Ks {\textgreater} 15.5 mag), which results from observational effects and the fact that our O star sample is not magnitude-limited but is defined by a spectral-type cutoff. We also conclude that magnitude-limited investigations are biased towards larger binary fractions. Conclusions. Using the multiplicity properties of the O stars in the Tarantula region and simple evolutionary considerations, we estimate that over 50{\%} of the current O star population will exchange mass with its companion within a binary system. This shows that binary interaction is greatly affecting the evolution and fate of massive stars, and must be taken into account to correctly interpret unresolved populations of massive stars. {\textcopyright} ESO 2013.},

abstract = {Winds from young massive stars contribute a large amount of energy to their host molecular clouds. This has consequences for the dynamics and observable structure of star-forming clouds. In this paper, we present radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of turbulent molecular clouds that form individual stars of 30, 60 and 120 solar masses emitting winds and ultraviolet radiation following realistic stellar evolution tracks. We find that winds contribute to the total radial momentum carried by the expanding nebula around the star at 10{\%} of the level of photoionisation feedback, and have only a small effect on the radial expansion of the nebula. Radiation pressure is largely negligible in the systems studied here. The 3D geometry and evolution of wind bubbles is highly aspherical and chaotic, characterised by fast-moving “chimneys” and thermally-driven “plumes”. These plumes can sometimes become disconnected from the stellar source due to dense gas flows in the cloud. Our results compare favourably with the findings of relevant simulations, analytic models and observations in the literature while demonstrating the need for full 3D simulations including stellar winds. However, more targeted simulations are needed to better understand results from observational studies.},

abstract = {Analysis of late O-type stars observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS) revealed a discrepancy between the physical properties estimated from model-atmosphere analysis and those expected from their morphological classifications. Here we revisit the analysis of 32 of these puzzling objects using new hydrogen-helium-silicon FASTWIND models and a different fitting approach to re-evaluate their physical properties. Our new analysis confirms that these stars indeed have properties that are typical of late O-type dwarfs. We also present the first estimates of silicon abundances for O-type stars in the 30 Dor clusters NGC 2060 and NGC 2070, with a weighted mean abundance for our sample of 7.05 +/- 0.03. Our values are about 0.20 dex lower than those previously derived for B-type stars in the LMC clusters N 11 and NGC 2004 using TLUSTY models. Various possibilities (e.g. differences in the analysis methods, effects of microturbulence, and real differences between stars in different clusters) were considered to account for these results. We also used our grid of FASTWIND models to reassess the impact of using the Galactic classification criteria for late O-type stars in the LMC by scrutinising their sensitivity to different stellar properties. At the cool edge of the O star regime the HeII 4686/HeI 4713 ratio used to assign luminosity class for Galactic stars can mimic giants or bright giants in the LMC, even for objects with high gravities (log{\_}g {\textgreater} 4.0 dex). We argue that this line ratio is not a reliable luminosity diagnostic for late O-type stars in the LMC, and that the SiIV 4989/HeI4026 ratio is more robust for these types.},

A hypothesized X-ray emitting shock front is predicted to produce P Cygni line profiles that, when saturated, are not reproducible with a monotonic wind. Extended absorption troughs with essentially zero residual intensities have been proposed as a useful spectroscopic diagnostic of nonmonotonic flow. Applied to observed profiles, this diagnostic does indeed indicate the existence of multiply nonmonotonic velocity fields in the outer parts of these winds, wherein the bulk of the X-ray emission is in fact predicted to originate. A quantitative analysis of the N V resonance line in the spectrum of one star reveals its absorption trough to be in strong contradiction with the hypothesis of a monotonic wind but not in contradiction with a nonmonotonic wind.},

abstract = {For application to surveys of interstellar matter and Galactic structure, we compute new spectrophotometric distances to 139 OB stars frequently used as background targets for UV spectroscopy. Many of these stars have updated spectral types and digital photometry with reddening corrections from the Galactic O-Star (GOS) spectroscopic survey. We compare our new photometric distances to values used in previous IUE and FUSE surveys and to parallax distances derived from Gaia-DR2, after applying a standard (0.03 mas) offset from the quasar celestial reference frame. We find substantial differences between photometric and parallax distances (at d {\textgreater} 1.5 kpc) with increasing dispersion when parallax errors exceed 8{\%}. Differences from previous surveys arise from new GOS stellar classifications, especially luminosity classes, and from reddening corrections. We apply our methods to two OB associations. For Perseus OB1 (nine O-stars) we find mean distances of {\$}2.47\backslashpm0.57{\$} kpc (Gaia parallax) and {\$}2.99\backslashpm0.14{\$} kpc (photometric) using a standard grid of absolute magnitudes (Bowen et al. 2008). For 29 O-stars in Car OB1 associated with Trumpler-16, Trumpler-14, Trumpler-15, and Collinder-228 star clusters, we find {\$}2.87\backslashpm0.73{\$} kpc (Gaia parallax) and {\$}2.60\backslashpm0.28{\$} kpc (photometric). Using an alternative grid of O-star absolute magnitudes (Martins et al. 2005) shifts these photometric distances 7{\%} closer. Improving the distances to OB-stars will require attention to spectral types, photometry, reddening, binarity, and the grid of absolute magnitudes. We anticipate that future measurements in Gaia-DR3 will improve the precision of distances to massive star-forming regions in the Milky Way.},

@article{Bowman2018,
abstract = {After stars formed in the early Universe, their ultraviolet light is expected, eventually, to have penetrated the primordial hydrogen gas and altered the excitation state of its 21-centimetre hyperfine line. This alteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave background, producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at radio frequencies of less than 200 megahertz. Here we report the detection of a flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged radio spectrum, which is centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width at half-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is largely consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by early stars; however, the best-fitting amplitude of the profile is more than a factor of two greater than the largest predictions. This discrepancy suggests that either the primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background radiation temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical phenomena (such as radiation from stars and stellar remnants) are unlikely to account for this discrepancy; of the proposed extensions to the standard model of cosmology and particle physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions between dark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed amplitude. The low-frequency edge of the observed profile indicates that stars existed and had produced a background of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons by 180 million years after the Big Bang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the gas was heated to above the radiation temperature less than 100 million years later.},

In particular, I will highlight some important observational facts explained by means of massive stars in galaxies of different morphological type: the Milky Way, ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. I will describe first the time-delay model and its interpretation in terms of abundance ratios in galaxies, then I will discuss the importance of mass loss in massive stars to reproduce the data in the Galactic bulge and disk. I will discuss also how massive stars can be important producers of primary nitrogen if rotation in stellar models is taken into account. Concerning elliptical galaxies, I will show that to reproduce the observed [Mg/Fe] versus Mass relation in these galaxies it is necessary to assume a more important role of massive stars in more massive galaxies and that this can be achieved by means of downsizing in star formation. I will discuss how massive stars are responsible in triggering galactic winds both in ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. These latter systems show a low overabundance of -elements relative to Fe with respect to Galactic stars of the same [Fe/H]: this is interpreted as due to a slow star formation coupled with very efficient galactic winds. Finally, I will show a comparison between the predicted Type Ib/c rates in galaxies and the observed GRB rate and how we can impose constraints on the mechanism of galaxy formation by studying the GRB rate at high redshift. {\textcopyright} 2008 Copyright International Astronomical Union 2008.},

abstract = {The members of the scarce category of Of+ supergiants present properties that are intermediate between regular O-stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Significant similarities between these transitional stars and WN-type objects are now clearly established, at least in the visible and near-infrared domains, pointing to common stellar wind properties. In this study, we report on the first dedicated X-ray observations of HD 16691 (O4If+) and HD 14947 (O5f+), revealing a soft thermal spectrum in agreement with the expected X-ray emission from a single O-type star. However, the X-ray luminosity of our targets is slightly lower than expected for single O-type stars, suggesting that the particular properties of their stellar wind has also a significant impact on the X-ray emission of these objects on the way to the WN category. We argue that the X-ray under-luminosity of HD 16691 and HD 14947 may be interpreted as the signature in X-rays of the intermediate stage between O and WR stars, as a consequence of enhanced wind density. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Context. The Tarantula region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) contains the richest population of spatially resolved massive O-Type stars known so far. This unmatched sample offers an opportunity to test models describing their main-sequence evolution and mass-loss properties. Aims. Using ground-based optical spectroscopy obtained in the framework of the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS), we aim to determine stellar, photospheric and wind properties of 72 presumably single O-Type giants, bright giants and supergiants and to confront them with predictions of stellar evolution and of line-driven mass-loss theories. Methods. We apply an automated method for quantitative spectroscopic analysis of O stars combining the non-LTE stellar atmosphere model fastwind with the genetic fitting algorithm pikaia to determine the following stellar properties: effective temperature, surface gravity, mass-loss rate, helium abundance, and projected rotational velocity. The latter has been constrained without taking into account the contribution from macro-Turbulent motions to the line broadening. Results. We present empirical effective temperature versus spectral subtype calibrations at LMC-metallicity for giants and supergiants. The calibration for giants shows a +1kK offset compared to similar Galactic calibrations; a shift of the same magnitude has been reported for dwarfs. The supergiant calibrations, though only based on a handful of stars, do not seem to indicate such an offset. The presence of a strong upturn at spectral type O3 and earlier can also not be confirmed by our data. In the spectroscopic and classical Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, our sample O stars are found to occupy the region predicted to be the core hydrogen-burning phase by state-of-The-Art models. For stars initially more massive than approximately 60 M, the giant phase already appears relatively early on in the evolution; the supergiant phase develops later. Bright giants, however, are not systematically positioned between giants and supergiants at M 25 M. At masses below 60 M, the dwarf phase clearly precedes the giant and supergiant phases; however this behavior seems to break down at M 18 M. Here, stars classified as late O III and II stars occupy the region where O9.5-9.7 V stars are expected, but where few such late O V stars are actually seen. Though we can not exclude that these stars represent a physically distinct group, this behavior may reflect an intricacy in the luminosity classification at late O spectral subtype. Indeed, on the basis of a secondary classification criterion, the relative strength of Si iv to He i absorption lines, these stars would have been assigned a luminosity class IV or V. Except for five stars, the helium abundance of our sample stars is in agreement with the initial LMC composition. This outcome is independent of their projected spin rates. The aforementioned five stars present moderate projected rotational velocities (i.e., $\nu$esini {\textless} 200kms-1) and hence do not agree with current predictions of rotational mixing in main-sequence stars. They may potentially reveal other physics not included in the models such as binary-interaction effects. Adopting theoretical results for the wind velocity law, we find modified wind momenta for LMC stars that are {\~{}}0.3 dex higher than earlier results. For stars brighter than 105 L, that is, in the regime of strong stellar winds, the measured (unclumped) mass-loss rates could be considered to be in agreement with line-driven wind predictions if the clump volume filling factors were fV 1/8 to 1/6.},

abstract = {The first generation of redshifted 21 cm detection experiments, carried out with arrays like Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and Giant Metrewave Telescope (GMRT), will have a very low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per resolution element (≲0.2). In addition, whereas the variance of the cosmological signal decreases on scales larger than the typical size of ionization bubbles, the variance of the formidable galactic foregrounds increases, making it hard to disentangle the two on such large scales. The poor sensitivity on small scales, on the one hand, and the foregrounds effect on large scales, on the other hand, make direct imaging of the Epoch of Reionization of the Universe very difficult, and detection of the signal therefore is expected to be statistical. Despite these hurdles, in this paper we argue that for many reionization scenarios low-resolution images could be obtained from the expected data. This is because at the later stages of the process one still finds very large pockets of neutral regions in the intergalactic medium, reflecting the clustering of the large-scale structure, which stays strong up to scales of ≈120 h-1 comovingMpc (≈1°). The coherence of the emission on those scales allows us to reach sufficient S/N (≳3) so as to obtain reionization 21 cm images. Such images will be extremely valuable for answering many cosmological questions but above all they will be a very powerful tool to test our control of the systematics in the data. The existence of this typical scale (≈120 h-1 comovingMpc) also argues for designing future EoR experiments, e.g. with Square Kilometre Array, with a field of view of at least 4°.},

abstract = {Spectral analysis of hot luminous stars requires adequate model atmospheres which take into account the effects of NLTE and radiation driven winds properly. Here we present significant improvements of our approach in constructing detailed atmospheric models and synthetic spectra for hot luminous stars. Moreover, as we regard our solution method in its present stage already as a standard procedure, we make our program package WM-basic available to the community (download is possible from the URL given below). The most important model improvements towards a realistic description of stationary wind models concern: (i) A sophisticated and consistent description of line blocking and blanketing. Our solution concept to this problem renders the line blocking influence on the ionizing fluxes emerging from the atmospheres of hot stars - mainly the spectral ranges of the EUV and the UV are affected - in identical quality as the synthetic high resolution spectra representing the observable region. In addition, the line blanketing effect is properly accounted for in the energy balance. (ii) The atomic data archive which has been improved and enhanced considerably, providing the basis for a detailed multilevel NLTE treatment of the metal ions (from C to Zn) and an adequate representation of line blocking and the radiative line acceleration. (iii) A revised inclusion of EUV and X-ray radiation produced by cooling zones which originate from the simulation of shock heated matter. This new tool not only provides an easy-to-use method for O-star diagnostics, whereby physical constraints on the properties of stellar winds, stellar parameters, and abundances can be obtained via a comparison of observed and synthetic spectra, but also allows the astrophysically important information about the ionizing fluxes of hot stars to be determined automatically. Results illustrating this are discussed by means of a basic model grid calculated for O-stars with solar metallicity. To further demonstrate the astrophysical potential of our new method, we first provide a detailed spectral diagnostic determination of the stellar parameters, the wind parameters, and the abundances by an exemplary application to one of our grid-stars, the O9.5Ia O-supergiant $\alpha$ Cam. Our abundance determinations of the light elements indicate that these deviate considerably from the solar values.},

The method is based on the Smooth Source Function (SSF) formalism for nonlocal evaluation of the radial line-force, implemented separately within each of a set of radiatively isolated azimuthal grid zones. The results show that radially compressed "shells" that develop initially from the LDI are systematically broken up by Rayleigh-Taylor or thin-shell instabilities as these structures are accelerated outward. Through radial feedback of backscattered radiation, this leads ultimately to a flow structure characterized by nearly complete lateral incoherence, with structure extending down to the lateral grid scale, which here corresponds to angle sizes of order a fifth of a degree. We briefly discuss the implications for interpreting various observational diagnostics of wind structure, but also emphasize the importance of future extensions to include lateral line-drag effects of diffuse radiation, which may set a minimum lateral scale for break-up of flow structure.},

abstract = {Context. Evolutionary models of massive stars predict a surface enrichment of nitrogen, due to rotational mixing. Recent studies within the VLT-FLAMES survey of massive stars have challenged (part of) these predictions. Such systematic determinations of nitrogen abundances, however, have been mostly performed only for cooler (B-type) objects. For the most massive and hottest stars, corresponding results are scarce. Aims. This is the first paper in a series dealing with optical nitrogen spectroscopy of O-type stars, aiming at the analysis of nitrogen abundances for stellar samples of significant size, to place further constraints on the early evolution of massive stars. Here we concentrate on the formation of the optical N III lines at $\gamma$$\gamma$ 4634?4640?4642 that are fundamental for the definition of the different morphological "f"-classes. Methods.We implement a new nitrogen model atom into the NLTE atmosphere/spectrum synthesis code fastwind, and compare the resulting optical N III spectra with other predictions, mostly from the seminal work by Mihalas {\&} Hummer (1973, ApJ, 179, 827, "MH"), and from the alternative code cmfgen. Results. Using similar model atmospheres as MH (not blanketed and wind-free), we are able to reproduce their results, in particular the optical triplet emission lines. According to MH, these should be strongly related to dielectronic recombination and the drain by certain two-electron transitions. However, using realistic, fully line-blanketed atmospheres at solar abundances, the key role of the dielectronic recombinations controlling these emission features is superseded-for O-star conditions-by the strength of the stellar wind and metallicity. Thus, in the case of wind-free (weak wind) models, the resulting lower ionizing EUV-fluxes severely suppress the emission. As the mass loss rate is increased, pumping through the N III resonance line(s) in the presence of a near-photospheric velocity field (i.e., the Swings-mechanism) results in a net optical triplet line emission. A comparison with results from cmfgen is mostly satisfactory, except for the range 30 000 K≤ Teff ≤ 35 000 K, where CMFGEN triggers the triplet emission at lower T eff than fastwind. This effect could be traced down to line overlap effects between the N III and O III resonance lines that cannot be simulated by fastwind so far, due to the lack of a detailed O III model atom. Conclusions. Since the efficiency of dielectronic recombination and "two electron drain" strongly depends on the degree of lineblanketing/-blocking, we predict the emission to become stronger in a metal-poor environment, though lower wind-strengths and nitrogen abundances might counteract this effect. Weak winded stars (if existent in the decisive parameter range) should display less triplet emission than their counterparts with "normal" winds. {\textcopyright} 2011 ESO.},

abstract = {Context. Recent studies of O-type stars have demonstrated that discrepant mass-loss rates are obtained when different diagnostic methods are employed. Fitting the unsaturated UV resonance lines (e.g., P v) gives drastically lower values than obtained from the H$\alpha$ emission. Wind inhomogeneity (so-called "clumping") may be the main cause of this discrepancy. Aims. In a previous paper, we presented 3D Monte-Carlo calculations for the formation of scattering lines in a clumped stellar wind. In the present paper we select five O-type supergiants (from O4 to O7) and test whether the reported discrepancies can be resolved this way. Methods. In the first step, the analyses started with simulating the observed spectra with Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) non-LTE model atmospheres. The mass-loss rates are adjusted to fit to the observed H$\alpha$ emission lines best. For the unsaturated UV resonance lines (i.e., P v) we then applied our 3D Monte-Carlo code, which can account for wind clumps of any optical depths ("macroclumping"), a non-void interclump medium, and a velocity dispersion inside the clumps. The ionization stratifications and underlying photospheric spectra were adopted from the PoWR models. The properties of the wind clumps were constrained by fitting the observed resonance line profiles. Results. Our results show that with the mass-loss rates that fit H$\alpha$ (and other Balmer and He ii lines), the UV resonance lines (especially the unsaturated doublet of P v) can also be reproduced with no problem when macroclumping is taken into account. There is no need to artificially reduce the mass-loss rates or to assume a subsolar phosphorus abundance or an extremely high clumping factor, unlike what was claimed by other authors. These consistent mass-loss rates are lower by a factor of 1.3 to 2.6, compared to the mass-loss rate recipe from Vink et al. Conclusions. Macroclumping resolves the previously reported discrepancy between H$\alpha$ and P v mass-loss diagnostics. {\textcopyright} 2013 ESO.},

We surveyed these O star systems in I-band, typically being able to detect a companion with a magnitude difference of about 6 in the projected separation range of 0.5 to 1.0 arcseconds, and of about 9.5 in the range of 1.0 to 5.0 arcseconds. In the course of the survey, we discovered 40 new companions among 31 of the 116 objects examined and made astrometric and differential magnitude measurements of 24 additional known pairs, several of them being confirmation detections. We present new astrometric orbits for two binaries, BU 1032AB (WDS 05387-0236; sig Ori AB) and SEE 322 (WDS 17158-3344; HD 155889AB). We lack magnitude differences for other filter bands, so it is difficult to determine physical from line-of-sight companions, but we present empirical arguments for the limiting magnitude difference where field contamination is significant.},

abstract = {We quantitatively investigate the extent of wind absorption signatures in the X-ray grating spectra of all non-magnetic, effectively single O stars in the Chandra archive via line profile fitting. Under the usual assumption of a spherically symmetric wind with embedded shocks, we confirm previous claims that some objects show little or no wind absorption. However, many other objects do show asymmetric and blueshifted line profiles, indicative of wind absorption. For these stars, we are able to derive wind mass-loss rates from the ensemble of line profiles, and find values lower by an average factor of 3 than those predicted by current theoretical models, and consistent with H$\alpha$ if clumping factors of fcl ≈ 20 are assumed. The same profile fitting indicates an onset radius of X-rays typically at r ≈ 1.5R*, and terminal velocities for the X-ray emitting wind component that are consistent with that of the bulk wind. We explore the likelihood that the stars in the sample that do not show significant wind absorption signatures in their line profiles have at least some X-ray emission that arises from colliding wind shocks with a close binary companion. The one clear exception is $\zeta$ Oph, a weak-wind star that appears to simply have a very low mass-loss rate. We also reanalyse the results from the canonical O supergiant $\zeta$ Pup, using a solar-metallicity wind opacity model and find Ṁ = 1.8 × 10-6 M⊙yr-1, consistent with recent multiwavelength determinations. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {Context. O stars are excellent tracers of the intervening ISM because of their high luminosity, blue intrinsic SED, and relatively featureless spectra. We are currently conducting the Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS), which is generating a large sample of O stars with accurate spectral types within several kpc of the Sun. Aims. We aim to obtain a global picture of the properties of dust extinction in the solar neighborhood based on optical-NIR photometry of O stars with accurate spectral types. Methods. We have processed a carefully selected photometric set with the CHORIZOS code to measure the amount [E(4405 - 5495)] and type [R5495] of extinction towards 562 O-type stellar systems. We have tested three different families of extinction laws and analyzed our results with the help of additional archival data. Results. The Ma{\'{i}}z Apell{\'{a}}niz et al. (2014, A{\&}A, 564, A63) family of extinction laws provides a better description of Galactic dust that either the Cardelli et al. (1989, ApJ, 345, 245) or Fitzpatrick (1999, PASP, 111, 63) families, so it should be preferentially used when analysing samples similar to the one in this paper. In many cases O stars and late-type stars experience similar amounts of extinction at similar distances but some O stars are located close to the molecular clouds left over from their births and have larger extinctions than the average for nearby late-type populations. In qualitative terms, O stars experience a more diverse extinction than late-type stars, as some are affected by the small-grain-size, low-R5495 effect of molecular clouds and others by the large-grain-size, high-R5495 effect of H II regions. Late-type stars experience a narrower range of grain sizes or R5495, as their extinction is predominantly caused by the average, diffuse ISM. We propose that the reason for the existence of large-grain-size, high-R5495 regions in the ISM in the form of H II regions and hot-gas bubbles is the selective destruction of small dust grains by EUV photons and possibly by thermal sputtering by atoms or ions.},

abstract = {Processes that promote the formation of dense cold clouds in the interstellar media of galaxies are reviewed. Those that involve background stellar mass include two-fluid instabilities, spiral density wave shocking, and bar accretion. Young stellar pressures trigger gas accumulation on the periphery of cleared cavities, which often take the form of rings by the time new stars form. Stellar pressures also trigger star formation in bright-rim structures, directly squeezing the pre-existing clumps in nearby clouds and clearing out the lower density gas between them. Observations of these processes are common. How they fit into the empirical star formation laws, which relate the star formation rate primarily to the gas density, is unclear. Most likely, star formation follows directly from the formation of cold dense gas, whatever the origin of that gas. If the average pressure from the weight of the gas layer is large enough to produce a high molecular fraction in the ambient medium, then star formation should follow from a variety of processes that combine and lose their distinctive origins. Pressurized triggering might have more influence on the star formation rate in regions with low average molecular fraction. This implies, for example, that the arm/interarm ratio of star formation efficiency should be higher in the outer regions of galaxies than in the main disks. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Astronomical Union.},

abstract = {Context. Recent observational studies indicate that a large number of OB stars are found within binary systems which may be expected to interact during their lifetimes. Significant mass transfer or indeed merger of both components is expected to modify evolutionary pathways, facilitating the production of exceptionally massive stars which will present as blue stragglers. Identification and characterisation of such objects is crucial if the efficiency of mass transfer is to be established; a critical parameter in determining the outcomes of binary evolutionary channels. Aims. The young and coeval massive cluster Westerlund 1 hosts a rich population of X-ray bright OB and Wolf-Rayet stars where the emission is attributed to shocks in the wind collision zones of massive binaries. Motivated by this, we instigated a study of the extremely X-ray luminous O supergiants Wd1-27 and-30a. Methods. We subjected a multi-wavelength and-epoch photometric and spectroscopic dataset to quantitative non-LTE model atmosphere and time-series analysis in order to determine fundamental stellar parameters and search for evidence of binarity. A detailed examination of the second Gaia data release was undertaken to establish cluster membership. Results. Both stars were found to be early/mid-O hypergiants with luminosities, temperatures and masses significantly in excess of other early stars within Wd1, hence qualifying as massive blue stragglers. The binary nature of Wd1-27 remains uncertain but the detection of radial velocity changes and the X-ray properties of Wd1-30a suggest that it is a binary with an orbital period =10 days. Analysis of Gaia proper motion and parallactic data indicates that both stars are cluster members; we also provide a membership list for Wd1 based on this analysis. Conclusions. The presence of hypergiants of spectral types O to M within Wd1 cannot be understood solely via single-star evolution. We suppose that the early-B and mid-O hypergiants formed via binary-induced mass-stripping of the primary and mass-transfer to the secondary, respectively. This implies that for a subset of objects massive star-formation may be regarded as a two-stage process, with binary-driven mass-transfer or merger yielding stars with masses significantly in excess of their initial "birth" mass.},

abstract = {We have analyzed the far-ultraviolet spectrum of two Galactic 04 stars, the O4If+ supergiant HD 190429A and the O4V((f)) dwarf HD 96715, using archival FUSE and IUE data. We have conducted a quantitative analysis using the two NLTE model atmosphere and wind codes, TLUSTY and CMFGEN, which incorporate a detailed treatment of NLTE metal line blanketing. From the far-UV spectrum, we have derived the stellar and wind parameters and the surface composition of the two stars. The surface of HD 190429A has a composition typical of an evolved O supergiant (nitrogen-rich, carbon and oxygen-poor), while HD 96715 exhibits surface nitrogen enhancement similar to the enrichment found in SMC O dwarfs which has been attributed to rotationally-induced mixing. Following studies of Magellanic Cloud O stars, we find that homogeneous wind models could not match the observed profile of 0 v$\lambda$ 1371 and require very low phosphorus abundance to fit the P V$\lambda$$\lambda$1118-1128 resonance lines. We show, on the other hand, that we are able to match the O V and P V lines using clumped wind models. In addition to these lines, we find that N IV/$\lambda$718 is also sensitive to wind clumping. For both stars, we have calculated clumped wind models that match well all these lines from different species and that remain consistent with H$\alpha$ data. In particular, we have achieved an excellent match of the P v resonance doublet, indicating that our physical description of clumping is adequate. These fits therefore provide a coherent and thus much stronger evidence of wind clumping in O stars than earlier claims. We show that the success of the clumped wind models in matching these lines results from increased recombination in the clumps, hence from a better description of the wind ionization structure. We find that the wind of these two stars is highly clumped, as expressed by very small volume filling factors, namely f ∞ = 0.04 for HD 190429A and f∞ = 0.02 for HD 96715. In agreement with our analysis of SMC stars, clumping starts deep in the wind, just above the sonic point. The most crucial consequence of our analysis is that the mass loss rates of O stars need to be revised downward significantly, by a factor of 3 and more. These lower mass loss rates will affect substantially the evolution of massive stars. Accounting for wind clumping is essential when determining the wind properties of O stars. Our study therefore calls for a fundamental revision in our understanding of mass loss and of O-type star stellar winds. {\textcopyright} ESO 2005.},

abstract = {Context. Massive stars likely played an important role in the reionization of the Universe, and the formation of the first black holes. They are potential progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts, seen up to redshifts of about ten. Massive stars in low-metallicity environments in the local Universe are reminiscent of their high redshift counterparts, emphasizing the importance of the study of their properties and evolution. In a previous paper, we reported on indications that the stellar winds of low-metallicity O stars may be stronger than predicted, which would challenge the current paradigm of massive star evolution. Aims. In this paper, we aim to extend our initial sample of six O stars in low-metallicity environments by four. The total sample of ten stars consists of the optically brightest sources in IC? 1613, WLM, and NGC? 3109. We aim to derive their stellar and wind parameters, and compare these to radiation-driven wind theory and stellar evolution models. Methods. We have obtained intermediate-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectra of our sample of stars. We derive the stellar parameters by fitting synthetic fastwindline profiles to the VLT/X-shooter spectra using a genetic fitting algoritm. We compare our parameters to evolutionary tracks and obtain evolutionary masses and ages. We also investigate the effective temperature versus spectral type calibration for SMC and lower metallicities. Finally, we reassess the wind momentum versus luminosity diagram. Results. The derived parameters of our target stars indicate stellar masses that reach values of up to 50 M. The wind strengths of our stars are, on average, stronger than predicted from radiation-driven wind theory and reminiscent of stars with an LMC metallicity. We discuss indications that the iron content of the host galaxies is higher than originally thought and is instead SMC-like. We find that the discrepancy with theory is reduced, but remains significant for this higher metallicity. This may imply that our current understanding of the wind properties of massive stars, both in the local universe as well as at cosmic distances, remains incomplete.},

abstract = {We have studied the optical spectra of a sample of 31 O- and early B-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, 21 of which are associated with the young massive cluster NGC 346. Stellar parameters are determined using an automated fitting method (Mokiem et al. 2005, A{\&}A, 441, 711), which combines the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND (Puls et al. 2005, A{\&}A, 435, 669) with the genetic algorithm based optimisation routine PIKAIA (Charbonneau 1995, ApJS, 101, 309). Comparison with predictions of stellar evolution that account for stellar rotation does not result in a unique age, though most stars are best represented by an age of 1-3 Myr. The automated method allows for a detailed determination of the projected rotational velocities. The present day v r sin i distribution of the 21 dwarf stars in our sample is consistent with an underlying rotational velocity (vr) distribution that can be characterised by a mean velocity of about 160-190 km s-1 and an effective half width of 100-150 km s-1. The vr distribution must include a small percentage of slowly rotating stars. If predictions of the time evolution of the equatorial velocity for massive stars within the environment of the SMC are correct (Maeder {\&} Meynet 2001, A{\&}A, 373, 555), the young age of the cluster implies that this underlying distribution is representative for the initial rotational velocity distribution. The location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the stars showing helium enrichment is in qualitative agreement with evolutionary tracks accounting for rotation, but not for those ignoring vr. The mass loss rates of the SMC objects having luminosities of log L*/L⊙ ≳5.4 are in excellent agreement with predictions by Vink et al. (2001, A{\&}A, 369, 574). However, for lower luminosity stars the winds are too weak to determine Ṁ accurately from the optical spectrum. Three targets were classifiedas Vz stars, two of which are located close to the theoretical zero-age main sequence. Three lower luminosity targets that were not classified as Vz stars are also found to lie near the ZAMS. We argue that this is related to a temperature effect inhibiting cooler from displaying the spectral features required for the Vz luminosity class. {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

@article{Puls2005,
abstract = {We present new or improved methods for calculating NLTE, line-blanketed model atmospheres for hot stars with winds (spectral types A to O), with particular emphasis on fast performance. These methods have been implemented into a previous, more simple version of the model atmosphere code FASTWIND (Santolaya-Rey et al. 1997) and allow us to spectroscopically analyze large samples of massive stars in a reasonable time-scale, using state-of-the-art physics. Although this updated version of the code has already been used in a number of recent investigations, the corresponding methods have not been explained in detail so far, and no rigorous comparison with results from alternative codes has been performed. This paper intends to address both topics. In particular, we describe our (partly approximate) approach to solve the equations of statistical equilibrium for those elements that are primarily responsible for line-blocking and blanketing, as well as an approximate treatment of the line-blocking itself, which is based on a simple statistical approach using suitable means of line opacities and emissivities. Both methods are validated by specific tests. Furthermore, we comment on our implementation of a consistent temperature structure. In the second part, we concentrate on a detailed comparison with results from two codes used in alternative spectroscopical investigations, namely CMFGEN (Hillier {\&} Miller 1998) and WM-Basic (Pauldrach et al. 2001). All three codes predict almost identical temperature structures and fluxes for $\lambda$ {\textgreater} 400 {\AA}, whereas at lower wavelengths a number of discrepancies are found. Particularly in the HeII continua, where fluxes and corresponding numbers of ionizing photons react extremely sensitively to subtle differences in the models, we consider any uncritical use of these quantities (e.g., in the context of nebula diagnostics) as unreliable. Optical H/He lines as synthesized by FASTWIND are compared with results from CMFGEN, obtaining a remarkable coincidence, except for the HeI singlets in the temperature range between 36 000 to 41 000 K for dwarfs and between 31 000 to 35 000 K for supergiants, where CMFGEN predicts much weaker lines. Consequences of these discrepancies are discussed. Finally, suggestions are presented as to adequately parameterize model-grids for hot stars with winds, with only one additional parameter compared to standard grids from plane-parallel, hydrostatic models. {\textcopyright} ESO 2005.},

abstract = {Extensive modiÐcations to the non-LTE radiative transfer code of Hillier have been made in order to improve the spectroscopic analysis of stars with stellar winds. The main improvement to the code is the inclusion of blanketing due to thousands of overlapping lines. To implement this e ect, we have used the idea of super levels Ðrst pioneered by Anderson. In our approach, levels with similar excitation energies and levels are grouped together. Within this group, we assume that the departure coefficients are identi-cal. Only the population (or equivalently, the departure coefficient) of the super level need be solved in order to fully specify the populations of the levels within a super level. Our approach is a natural exten-sion of the single-level LTE assumption, and thus LTE is recovered exactly at depth. In addition to the line blanketing modiÐcations, the code has been improved signiÐcantly in other regards. In particular, the new code incorporates the e ect of level dissolution, the in{\~{N}}uence of reso-nances in the photoionization cross sections, and the e ect of Auger ionization. Electron scattering with a thermal redistribution can be considered, although it is normally treated coherently in the comoving frame (which still leads to redistribution in the observer{\"{I}}s frame). Several example calculations are described to demonstrate the importance of line blanketing on spec-troscopic analysis. We Ðnd that the inclusion of blanketing modiÐes the strengths of some optical CNO lines in Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars by factors of 2{\`{E}}5. In particular, the strengths of the WC classiÐcation lines C III j5696 and C IV j5805 are both increased because of iron blanketing. This should help alleviate problems found with nonblanketed models, which were incapable of matching the strengths of these lines. We also Ðnd that, in the UV (1100{\`{E}}1800 the in{\~{N}}uence of Fe is readily seen in both emission A ), and absorption. The emission is sensitive to the iron abundance and should allow, for the Ðrst time, Fe abundances to be deduced in W-R stars. The improvements made to our code should greatly facilitate the spectroscopic analysis of stars with stellar winds. We will be able to determine the importance and in{\~{N}}uence of line blanketing, as well as of several other e ects that have been included in the new code.

abstract = {Context. Clumping in the radiation-driven winds of hot, massive stars arises naturally due to the strong, intrinsic instability of line-driving (the line-deshadowing instability, hereafter LDI). But LDI wind models have so far mostly been limited to 1D, mainly because of the severe computational challenges regarding calculation of the multi-dimensional radiation force. Aim. In this paper we simulate and examine the dynamics and multi-dimensional nature of wind structure resulting from the LDI. Methods. We introduce a pseudo-planar, box-in-a-wind method that allows us to efficiently compute the line force in the radial and lateral directions, and then use this approach to carry out 2D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the time-dependent wind. Results. Our 2D simulations show that the LDI first manifests itself by mimicking the typical shell structure seen in 1D models, but that these shells quickly break up into complex 2D density and velocity structures, characterized by small-scale density "clumps" embedded in larger regions of fast and rarefied gas. Key results of the simulations are that density variations in the well-developed wind are statistically quite isotropic and that characteristic length scales are small; a typical clump size is ? cl? R∗∼ 0.01 at 2R∗, thus also resulting in rather low typical clump masses mcl ∼ 1017 g. Overall, our results agree well with the theoretical expectation that the characteristic scale for LDI generated wind-structure is on the order of the Sobolev length l Sob. We further confirm some earlier results that lateral "filling in" of radially compressed gas leads to somewhat lower clumping factors in 2D simulations than in comparable 1D models. We conclude by discussing an extension of our method toward rotating LDI wind models that exhibit an intriguing combination of large- and small-scale structures extending down to the wind base.},

abstract = {Context. Stellar evolution models of massive stars are very sensitive to the adopted mass-loss scheme. The magnitude and evolution of mass-loss rates significantly affect the main sequence evolution, and the properties of post-main sequence objects, including their rotational velocities. Aims. Driven by potential discrepancies between theoretically predicted and observationally derived mass-loss rates in the OB star range, we aim in particular to investigate the response to mass-loss rates that are lower than currently adopted, in parallel with the mass-loss behavior at the "first" bi-stability jump. Methods. We performed 1D hydrodynamical model calculations of single 20-60 M{\textperiodcentered} Galactic (Z = 0.014) stars where the effects of stellar winds are already significant in the main sequence phase. We have developed an experimental wind routine to examine the behavior and response of the models under the influence of different mass-loss rates. This observationally guided, simple and flexible wind routine is not a new mass-loss description but a useful tool based on the wind-momentum luminosity relation and other scaling relations, and provides a meaningful base for various tests and comparisons. Results. The main result of this study indicates a dichotomy between solutions of currently debated problems regarding mass-loss rates of hot massive stars. In a fully diffusive approach, and for commonly adopted initial rotational velocities, lower mass-loss rates than theoretically predicted require to invoke an additional source of angular momentum loss (either due to bi-stability braking, or yet unidentified) to brake down surface rotational velocities. On the other hand, a large jump in the mass-loss rates due to the bi-stability mechanism (a factor of 5-7 predicted by Vink et al. (2000, A{\&}A, 362, 295), but a factor of 10-20 in modern models of massive stars) is challenged by observational results, and might be avoided if the early mass-loss rates agreed with the theoretically predicted values. Conclusions. We conclude that simultaneously adopting lower mass-loss rates and a significantly smaller jump in the mass-loss rates over the bi-stability region (both compared to presently used prescriptions) would require an additional mechanism for angular momentum loss to be present in massive stars. Otherwise, the observed rotational velocities of a large population of B supergiants, that are thought to be the evolutionary descendants of O stars, would remain unexplained.},

abstract = {Context. Radiation-driven mass loss plays a key role in the life-cycles of massive stars. However, basic predictions of such mass loss still suffer from significant quantitative uncertainties. Aims. We develop new radiation-driven, steady-state wind models for massive stars with hot surfaces, suitable for quantitative predictions of global parameters like mass-loss and wind-momentum rates. Methods. The simulations presented here are based on a self-consistent, iterative grid-solution to the spherically symmetric, steady-state equation of motion, using full NLTE radiative transfer solutions in the co-moving frame to derive the radiative acceleration. We do not rely on any distribution functions or parametrization for computation of the line force responsible for the wind driving. The models start deep in the subsonic and optically thick atmosphere and extend up to a large radius at which the terminal wind speed has been reached. Results. In this first paper, we present models representing two prototypical O-stars in the Galaxy, one with a higher stellar mass M∗/M⊙ = 59 and luminosity log10 L∗/L⊙ = 5.87 (spectroscopically an early O supergiant) and one with a lower M∗/M⊙ = 27 and log10 L∗/L⊙ = 5.1 (a late O dwarf). For these simulations, basic predictions for global mass-loss rates, velocity laws, and wind momentum are given, and the influence from additional parameters like wind clumping and microturbulent speeds discussed. A key result is that although our mass-loss rates agree rather well with alternative models using co-moving frame radiative transfer, they are significantly lower than those predicted by the mass-loss recipes normally included in models of massive-star evolution. Conclusions. Our results support previous suggestions that Galactic O-star mass-loss rates may be overestimated in present-day stellar evolution models, and that new rates thus might be needed. Indeed, future papers in this series will incorporate our new models into such simulations of stellar evolution, extending the very first simulations presented here toward larger grids covering a range of metallicities, B supergiants across the bistability jump, and possibly also Wolf-Rayet stars.},

However, the origin of this connection is unknown. To probe the nature of the rotation connection, several of the attendees at the workshop on Instability and Variability of Hot-Star Winds drafted an IUE observing proposal. The goal of this program was to follow three stars for several rotations to determine whether the rotation connection is correlative or causal. The stars selected for monitoring all have rotation periods {\textless}=5 days. They were HD 50896 (WN5), HD 64760 (B0.5 Ib), and HD 66811 [ zeta Pup; O4 If(n)]. During 16 days of nearly continuous observations in 1995 January (dubbed the "MEGA" campaign), 444 high-dispersion IUE spectra of these stars were obtained. This Letter presents an overview of the results of the MEGA campaign and provides an introduction to the three following Letters, which discuss the results for each star.},

abstract = {We present a generalized formalism for treating the porosity-associated reduction in continuum opacity that occurs when individual clumps in a stochastic medium become optically thick. As in previous work, we concentrate on developing bridging laws between the limits of optically thin and thick clumps. We consider geometries resulting in either isotropic or anisotropic effective opacity, and, in addition to an idealized model in which all clumps have the same local overdensity and scale, we also treat an ensemble of clumps with optical depths set by Markovian statistics. This formalism is then applied to the specific case of bound-free absorption of X-rays in hot star winds, a process not directly affected by clumping in the optically thin limit. We find that the Markov model gives surprisingly similar results to those found previously for the single-clump model, suggesting that porous opacity is not very sensitive to details of the assumed clump distribution function. Further, an anisotropic effective opacity favours escape of X-rays emitted in the tangential direction (the 'venetian blind' effect), resulting in a 'bump' of higher flux close to line centre as compared to profiles computed from isotropic porosity models. We demonstrate how this characteristic line shape may be used to diagnose the clump geometry, and we confirm previous results that for optically thick clumping to significantly influence X-ray line profiles, very large porosity lengths, defined as the mean free path between clumps, are required. Moreover, we present the first X-ray line profiles computed directly from line-driven instability simulations using a 3D patch method, and find that porosity effects from such models also are very small. This further supports the view that porosity has, at most, a marginal effect on X-ray line diagnostics in O stars, and therefore that these diagnostics do indeed provide a good 'clumping insensitive' method for deriving O star mass-loss rates. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

These three stars have T* = 140 kK and 200 kK, the last two being well above the bulk of WR stars with T* {\~{}} 40-120 kK. This full temperature range for WR stars is much broader than that of their O-star progenitors ({\~{}}30-50 kK), so is better suited to look for any temperature dependence of wind clumping. We have obtained multiple observations with high signal-to-noise, moderate-resolution spectroscopy in search of smallscale variability in the strong emission lines from the dense winds of these three extreme stars, and find a very low-level of variability in both stars. Temperature and terminal velocity are correlated, so faster winds show a lower variability, though this trend goes against any predictions made involving Line Deshadowing Instability (LDI) only, implying that instabilities intrinsic to LDI are not the main source of wind clumping. Instead, it could be taken as support for the suggestion that clumps are caused by a sub-surface convection zone (SSCZ) at T {\~{}} 170 kK, since such an SSCZ would have little opportunity to operate under the hydrostatic surface of these hottest WR stars. It is still possible, however, that an SSCZ-related driver could interact with nonlinear line instability effects to enhance or possibly even produce clumps.},

abstract = {We perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the structure and dynamics of the radiationdominated envelopes of massive stars at the location of the iron opacity peak. One-dimensional hydrostatic calculations predict an unstable density inversion at this location, whereas our simulations reveal a complex interplay of convective and radiative transport whose behavior depends on the ratio of the photon diffusion time to the dynamical time. The latter is set by the ratio of the optical depth per pressure scale height, t0, to tc = c cg, where cg 50 kms-1 is the isothermal sound speed in the gas alone. When , t0 蠑 tc convection reduces the radiation acceleration and removes the density inversion. The turbulent energy transport in the simulations agrees with mixing length theory and provides its first numerical calibration in the radiation-dominated regime. When t0 蠐 tc, convection becomes inefficient and the turbulent energy transport is negligible. The turbulent velocities exceed cg, driving shocks and large density fluctuations that allow photons to preferentially diffuse out through low-density regions. However, the effective radiation acceleration is still larger than the gravitational acceleration so that the time average density profile contains a modest density inversion. In addition, the simulated envelope undergoes large-scale oscillations with periods of a few hours. The turbulent velocity field may affect the broadening of spectral lines and therefore stellar rotation measurements in massive stars, while the time variable outer atmosphere could lead to variations in their mass loss and stellar radius.},

abstract = {Context.The mass-loss rate is a key parameter of massive stars. Adequate stellar atmosphere models are required for spectral analyses and mass-loss determinations. Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity of stellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are optically thin. Compared to previous homogeneous models, this treatment of " microclumping" has led to reducing empirical mass-loss rates by factors of two to three. Further reductions are presently discussed in the literature, with far-reaching consequences e.g. for stellar evolution and stellar yields.Aims.Stellar wind clumps can be optically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this "macroclumping" influences the radiative transfer and the emergent line spectra and discuss its impact on empirical mass-loss rates.Methods.The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code is generalized in the "formal integral" to account for clumps that are not necessarily optically thin. The stellar wind is characterized by the filling factor of the dense clumps and by their average separation. An effective opacity is obtained by adopting a statistical distribution of clumps and applied in the radiative transfer.Results.Optically thick clumps reduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent spectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant $\zeta$ Puppis reveals that the optically thin H line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the $\zeta$ v resonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into account. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and recombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping modeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. In the case of Wolf-Rayet stars, we demonstrate for two representative models that stronger lines are typically reduced by a factor of two in intensity, while weak lines remain unchanged by porosity effects.Conclusions.Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H line in O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of optically thick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore, neglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimating empirical mass-loss rates. {\textcopyright} 2007 ESO.},

abstract = {We have studied superionization and X-ray line formation in the spectra of Zeta Pup using our new stellar atmosphere code (XCMFGEN) that can be used to simultaneously analyze optical, UV, and X-ray observations. Here, we present results on the formation of the O VI ll1032, 1038 doublet. Our simulations, supported by simple theoretical calculations, show that clumped wind models that assume void in the interclump space cannot reproduce the observed O VI profiles. However, enough O VI can be produced if the voids are filled by a low density gas. The recombination of O VI is very efficient in the dense material but in the tenuous interclump region an observable amount of O VI can be maintained. We also find that different UV resonance lines are sensitive to different density regimes in Zeta Pup : C IV is almost exclusively formed within the densest regions, while the majority of O VI resides between clumps. N V is an intermediate case, with contributions from both the tenuous gas and clumps.},

abstract = {The evolution and fate of very massive stars (VMS) is tightly connected to their mass-loss properties. Their initial and final masses differ significantly as a result of mass loss. VMS have strong stellar winds and extremely high ionising fluxes, which are thought to be critical sources of both mechanical and radiative feedback in giant H{\^{a}}‰ ii regions. However, how VMS mass-loss properties change during stellar evolution is poorly understood. In the framework of the VLT-Flames Tarantula Survey (VFTS), we explore the mass-loss transition region from optically thin O star winds to denser WNh Wolf-Rayet star winds, thereby testing theoretical predictions. To this purpose we select 62 O, Of, Of/WN, and WNh stars, an unprecedented sample of stars with the highest masses and luminosities known. We perform a spectral analysis of optical VFTS as well as near-infrared VLT/SINFONI data using the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN to obtain both stellar and wind parameters. For the first time, we observationally resolve the transition between optically thin O star winds and optically thick hydrogen-rich WNh Wolf-Rayet winds. Our results suggest the existence of a "kink" between both mass-loss regimes, in agreement with recent Monte Carlo simulations. For the optically thick regime, we confirm the steep dependence on the classical Eddington factor $\Gamma$e from previous theoretical and observational studies. The transition occurs on the main sequence near a luminosity of 106.1L{\^{a}}{\v{S}}™, or a mass of 80. 90 M. Above this limit, we find that-even when accounting for moderate wind clumping (with fv = 0.1)-wind mass-loss rates are enhanced with respect to standard prescriptions currently adopted in stellar evolution calculations. We also show that this results in substantial helium surface enrichment. Finally, based on our spectroscopic analyses, we are able to provide the most accurate ionising fluxes for VMS known to date, confirming the pivotal role of VMS in ionising and shaping their environments.},

The stellar and wind parameters of these sources allow us, for the first time, to probe the mass loss versus metallicity dependence of stellar winds at metallicities below that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (at Z 1/5 Z) by means of a modified wind momentum versus luminosity diagram. The wind strengths that we obtain for the objects in WLM and NGC3109 are unexpectedly high and do not agree with theoretical predictions. The objects in IC1613 tend toward a higher than expected mass-loss rate, but remain consistent with predictions within their error bars. We discuss potential systematic uncertainties in the mass-loss determinations to explain our results. However, if further scrutinization of these findings point towards an intrinsic cause for this unexpected sub-SMC mass-loss behavior, implications would include a higher than anticipated number of Wolf-Rayet stars and Ib/Ic supernovae in low-metallicity environments, but a reduced number of long-duration gamma-ray bursts produced through a single-star evolutionary channel. {\textcopyright} 2011.

We have conducted a quantitative analysis using the two NLTE model atmosphere and wind codes, TLUSTY and CMFGEN, which incorporate a detailed treatment of NLTE metal line blanketing. From the far-UV spectrum, we have derived the stellar and wind parameters and the surface composition of the two stars. The surface of HD 190429A has a composition typical of an evolved O supergiant (nitrogen-rich, carbon and oxygen-poor), while HD 96715 exhibits surface nitrogen enhancement similar to the enrichment found in SMC O dwarfs which has been attributed to rotationally-induced mixing. Following studies of Magellanic Cloud O stars, we find that homogeneous wind models could not match the observed profile of 0 v$\lambda$ 1371 and require very low phosphorus abundance to fit the P V$\lambda$$\lambda$1118-1128 resonance lines. We show, on the other hand, that we are able to match the O V and P V lines using clumped wind models. In addition to these lines, we find that N IV/$\lambda$718 is also sensitive to wind clumping. For both stars, we have calculated clumped wind models that match well all these lines from different species and that remain consistent with H$\alpha$ data. In particular, we have achieved an excellent match of the P v resonance doublet, indicating that our physical description of clumping is adequate. These fits therefore provide a coherent and thus much stronger evidence of wind clumping in O stars than earlier claims. We show that the success of the clumped wind models in matching these lines results from increased recombination in the clumps, hence from a better description of the wind ionization structure. We find that the wind of these two stars is highly clumped, as expressed by very small volume filling factors, namely f ∞ = 0.04 for HD 190429A and f∞ = 0.02 for HD 96715. In agreement with our analysis of SMC stars, clumping starts deep in the wind, just above the sonic point. The most crucial consequence of our analysis is that the mass loss rates of O stars need to be revised downward significantly, by a factor of 3 and more. These lower mass loss rates will affect substantially the evolution of massive stars. Accounting for wind clumping is essential when determining the wind properties of O stars. Our study therefore calls for a fundamental revision in our understanding of mass loss and of O-type star stellar winds. {\textcopyright} ESO 2005.},

@article{Sundqvist2011a,
abstract = {Context. Mass loss is essential for massive star evolution, thus also for the variety of astrophysical applications relying on its predictions. However, mass-loss rates currently in use for hot, massive stars have recently been seriously questioned, mainly because of the effects of wind clumping. Aims. We investigate the impact of clumping on diagnostic ultraviolet resonance and optical recombination lines often used to derive empirical mass-loss rates of hot stars. Optically thick clumps, a non-void interclump medium, and a non-monotonic velocity field are all accounted for in a single model. The line formation is first theoretically studied, after which an exemplary multi-diagnostic study of an O-supergiant is performed. Methods. We used 2D and 3D stochastic and radiation-hydrodynamic wind models, constructed by assembling 1D snapshots in radially independent slices. To compute synthetic spectra, we developed and used detailed radiative transfer codes for both recombination lines (solving the "formal integral") and resonance lines (using a Monte-Carlo approach). In addition, we propose an analytic method to model these lines in clumpy winds, which does not rely on optically thin clumping. Results. The importance of the "vorosity" effect for line formation in clumpy winds is emphasized. Resonance lines are generally more affected by optically thick clumping than recombination lines. Synthetic spectra calculated directly from current radiation-hydrodynamic wind models of the line-driven instability are unable to in parallel reproduce strategic optical and ultraviolet lines for the Galactic O-supergiant $\lambda$ Cep. Using our stochastic wind models, we obtain consistent fits essentially by increasing the clumping in the inner wind. A mass-loss rate is derived that is approximately two times lower than what is predicted by the line-driven wind theory, but much higher than the corresponding rate derived when assuming optically thin clumps. Our analytic formulation for line formation is used to demonstrate the potential importance of optically thick clumping in diagnostic lines in so-called weak-winded stars and to confirm recent results that resonance doublets may be used as tracers of wind structure and optically thick clumping. Conclusions. We confirm earlier results that a re-investigation of the structures in the inner wind predicted by line-driven instability simulations is needed. Our derived mass-loss rate for $\lambda$ Cep suggests that only moderate reductions of current mass-loss predictions for OB-stars are necessary, but this nevertheless prompts investigations on feedback effects from optically thick clumping on the steady-state, NLTE wind models used for quantitative spectroscopy. {\textcopyright} 2011 ESO.},

Agreement between the observed and new theoretical wind momenta increases confidence in the possibility to derive distances to luminous stars in distant stellar systems using the Wind momentum Luminosity Relation. For the winds of the B stars there is an inconsistency in the literature between various mass-loss rate determinations from observations by different methods. One group of M determinations of B stars does follow the new theoretical relation, while another group does not. The lack of agreement between the observed mass-loss rates derived by different methods may point to systematic errors in mass-loss determinations from observations for B stars.

abstract = {Extensive modiÐcations to the non-LTE radiative transfer code of Hillier have been made in order to improve the spectroscopic analysis of stars with stellar winds. The main improvement to the code is the inclusion of blanketing due to thousands of overlapping lines. To implement this e ect, we have used the idea of super levels Ðrst pioneered by Anderson. In our approach, levels with similar excitation energies and levels are grouped together. Within this group, we assume that the departure coefficients are identi-cal. Only the population (or equivalently, the departure coefficient) of the super level need be solved in order to fully specify the populations of the levels within a super level. Our approach is a natural exten-sion of the single-level LTE assumption, and thus LTE is recovered exactly at depth. In addition to the line blanketing modiÐcations, the code has been improved signiÐcantly in other regards. In particular, the new code incorporates the e ect of level dissolution, the in{\~{N}}uence of reso-nances in the photoionization cross sections, and the e ect of Auger ionization. Electron scattering with a thermal redistribution can be considered, although it is normally treated coherently in the comoving frame (which still leads to redistribution in the observer{\"{I}}s frame). Several example calculations are described to demonstrate the importance of line blanketing on spec-troscopic analysis. We Ðnd that the inclusion of blanketing modiÐes the strengths of some optical CNO lines in Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars by factors of 2{\`{E}}5. In particular, the strengths of the WC classiÐcation lines C III j5696 and C IV j5805 are both increased because of iron blanketing. This should help alleviate problems found with nonblanketed models, which were incapable of matching the strengths of these lines. We also Ðnd that, in the UV (1100{\`{E}}1800 the in{\~{N}}uence of Fe is readily seen in both emission A ), and absorption. The emission is sensitive to the iron abundance and should allow, for the Ðrst time, Fe abundances to be deduced in W-R stars. The improvements made to our code should greatly facilitate the spectroscopic analysis of stars with stellar winds. We will be able to determine the importance and in{\~{N}}uence of line blanketing, as well as of several other e ects that have been included in the new code. It will also allow us to better determine W-R star parameters, such as luminosity, elemental abundances, wind velocity, and mass-loss rate. With future application to related objects, such as novae and supernovae, our new code should also improve our understanding of these objects with extended out{\~{N}}owing atmospheres.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of AV 83, an O7 Iaf+ supergiant, and AV 69 [OC7.5 III((f))] in the SMC. The stars have similar effective temperatures and luminosities but show very different wind signatures. For our study we have used the non-LTE line-blanketed atmosphere code developed by Hillier and Miller, which explicitly allows for line blanketing by C, N, O, S, Ar, Ne, Fe, and other elements. Our study finds that AV 83 has an effective temperature of approximately 33,000 K and logg{\~{}}3.25. It has an extended photosphere as a result of a ``low'' effective surface gravity and a much denser wind than main-sequence O stars. We can match the spectrum only by using a slow velocity law with $\beta${\~{}}2, a value that is much larger than the values of around 1 predicted by standard radiation wind theory. Further, we show that the H$\alpha$ emission profile in AV 83 is sensitive to the adopted surface gravity. To fit the spectrum of AV 83, we have considered conventional models in which the wind is smooth and alternate models in which the winds are highly clumped. Both types of winds yield a satisfactory fit to the majority of lines in the observed spectrum; however, strong UV photospheric lines and the P V resonance transitions favor a clumped wind. If clumping is important, it must begin at relatively low velocities (i.e., 30 km s-1, not 300 km s-1). In the smooth wind, the line force is too small to drive the wind. In the clumped wind, the line force is generally sufficient to drive the wind, although there are still some discrepancies around the sonic point. In AV 83, the N abundance is substantially enhanced relative to normal SMC abundances, while both C and O are SMC-like, consistent with the presence of internally processed CNO material at the stellar surface. The N III $\lambda$4640 multiplet, which is known to be produced by dielectronic recombination, is well reproduced by the models. These lines, and the adjacent C III $\lambda$4649 multiplet, show a significant sensitivity to surface gravity, as well as the usual sensitivity to abundance and effective temperature. Incoherent electron scattering, occurring within the photosphere, can explain the broad wings seen on these lines. We have modeled the Fe spectrum (Fe IV-Fe VI) in the UV in both AV 83 and AV 69. For stars with an effective temperature around 33,000 K, the Fe IV-to-Fe V line ratios form a useful effective temperature diagnostic and give results consistent with those found from optical and UV line diagnostics. The derived iron abundance, which is sensitive to the adopted microturbulent velocity, is 0.2-0.4 times the solar iron abundance in AV 83, while 0.2 solar gives a good fit for AV 69. The wind of AV 69 is substantially less dense than that of AV 83. Because of the lack of suitable diagnostics, it is impossible to constrain the mass-loss rate and velocity law independently. Its spectrum indicates that it has a similar effective temperature to AV 83 (Teff{\~{}}34,000 K), a substantially higher gravity (logg=3.5) than AV 83, and a CNO abundance pattern that has not been influenced by internal CNO processing. We show that the N/C abundance ratio is substantially below solar, in agreement with SMC nebular and stellar abundance studies. The differences between the spectra of AV 83 and AV 69, and between the derived masses and surface abundances, are striking. We have examined possible causes, and only one seems consistent with the observations and our current understanding of massive star evolution. AV 83 was most likely a fast rotator that experienced rotationally enhanced mass loss. The presence of enhanced N but almost normal C and O abundances is a direct indication of rotationally induced mixing. On the other hand, AV 69 is a slow rotator. As part of our analyses, we have systematically examined the influence of the H/He abundance ratio, the mass-loss rate, the velocity law, the Fe abundance, microturbulence, and clumping on the theoretical spectrum. We illustrate which lines provide useful diagnostics and highlight some of the difficulties associated with spectroscopic analyses of O stars. The spectrum of AV 83 shows the presence of photospheric absorption lines, the presence of lines formed at the base of the wind, and numerous wind lines. Since these lines sample the photosphere and the entire wind, extreme O If supergiants, such as AV 83, are ideal candidates to probe conditions in stellar winds and hence further our knowledge of O star winds.

abstract = {We present non-LTE analyses of high quality spectra for two B-type supergiants, $\kappa$ Orionis {\&} ∈ Orionis (spectral types B0.5 Ia {\&} B0 Ia respectively). We investigate the effect of including a microturbulent velocity in the H I, He II and He I line broadening on the derived stellar atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g and y). Its inclusion has a significant effect on the profiles of the lines of neutral helium and leads to approximately normal estimates for the helium fractional abundances for both supergiants. By contrast, adopting zero microturbulence implies significant helium overabundances, if we adopt the mean abundance of all the lines considered here. The He I lines at 4437, 4387 and 5047{\AA} are found to be rather insensitive to microturbulence and hence are more reliable indicators of helium abundance. There are some remaining unresolved discrepancies, such as a systematic difference between singlet and triplet transitions which we attribute to the neglect of line blocking, while the 5015{\AA} 21S - 31P transition remains much stronger than predicted. This latter problem we tentatively attribute to the neglect of sphericity; the generalized dilution effect discussed by Voels et al. (1989). We suggest that a judicious choice of He I lines, and the use of an appropriate microturbulent velocity, may contribute to resolving the 'helium discrepancy' in O-type stars. The question of the origin of a perceived microturbulence in supergiants is also briefly discussed in the context of stellar winds. That two normal supergiants have close to solar helium abundances clearly implies that they have not undergone dredge-up in a previous red supergiant phase of evolution, supporting the contention that massive stars do not perform blue loops in the HR diagram at solar metallicity. Marginal evidence for a mild helium overabundance in $\kappa$ Ori however could be interpreted as being due to mixing processes, perhaps during its main sequence lifetime.},

@article{Feldmeier1995,
abstract = {We present time-dependent hydrodynamical models of radiation driven hot$\backslash$nstar winds, which are subject to a strong instability intrinsic to the$\backslash$nradiative line force. The calculations are done using a newly developed$\backslash$nradiation hydrodynamics code applying the Smooth Source Function method$\backslash$n(Owocki 1991) to calculate the radiative acceleration. Assuming$\backslash$nspherical symmetry, the wind consists of a sequence of narrow, dense$\backslash$nshells, where each shell is bounded by a pair of reverse and forward$\backslash$nshocks, in good agreement with comparable models by Owocki (1992). We$\backslash$nfind frequent encounters of two shells with subsequent merging of the$\backslash$nshells into one. For small periodic base perturbations, the wind$\backslash$nstructure is also periodic, without a stochastic component. For large$\backslash$nbase perturbations, on the other hand, a continuous spectrum of wave$\backslash$nfrequencies is excited in the wind. Furthermore, our models show the$\backslash$nshock decay to set in from about 5 stellar radii on. The major theme of$\backslash$nthis paper is the energy transfer in the wind. Time-dependent supergiant$\backslash$nwind models up to now simply assume radiative cooling to be efficient,$\backslash$nand hence the shocks to be isothermal. To test this assumption and to$\backslash$ncalculate the X-ray emission, the energy equation is included in the$\backslash$nsimulations. A severe numerical shortcoming is then encountered, whereby$\backslash$nall radiative cooling zones collapse and the shocks become isothermal$\backslash$nagain. We propose a new method to hinder this defect. Simulations of$\backslash$ndense winds then prove radiative cooling to indeed be efficient up to 5$\backslash$nto 7 R{\_}*{\_}. Shock temperatures are between 10{\^{}}6{\^{}} to 10{\^{}}7{\^{}}K, depending on$\backslash$nthe base perturbation. Beyond these radii, however, the cooling zones of$\backslash$nstrong shocks become broad and thereby alter the wind structure$\backslash$ndrastically: all reverse shocks disappear, leaving regions of previously$\backslash$nheated gas. This gas cools as it advects to larger radii. Since,$\backslash$nmoreover, shell-shell collisions only occur up to 6 to 7 R{\_}*{\_}, the wind$\backslash$ncan be divided into two regions: an inner, active one with frequent$\backslash$nshocks and shell-shell collisions; and an outer, quiescent region with$\backslash$n''old'' hot material, and with no further shell collisions.$\backslash$n},

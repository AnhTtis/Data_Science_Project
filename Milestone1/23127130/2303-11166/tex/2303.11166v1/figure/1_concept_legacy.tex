    \caption{Illustration of \Algname (\ALGname). The key ingredient of \ALGname is twofold: (a) self-imitation via planning and (b) subgoal skipping. For (a), we distill a subgoal-conditioned policy into the target-conditioned policy via our proposed loss term $\mathcal{L}_{\mathtt{\ALGname}}$. For (b), when we execute a policy along with a graph-based planning, we provide a subgoal depending on the strength of a current policy, measured by our proposed loss term $\mathcal{L}_{\mathtt{\ALGname}}$.}

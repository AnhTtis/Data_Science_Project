    "abstract": "Exoplanet atmospheric retrieval is a computational technique widely used to infer properties of planetary atmospheres from remote spectroscopic observations. Retrieval codes typically employ Bayesian sampling algorithms or machine learning approaches to explore the range of atmospheric properties (e.g., chemical composition, temperature structure, aerosols) compatible with an observed spectrum. However, despite the wide adoption of exoplanet retrieval techniques, there is currently no systematic summary of exoplanet retrieval codes in the literature. Here, we provide a catalogue of the atmospheric retrieval codes published to date, alongside links to their respective code repositories where available. Our catalogue will be continuously updated via a Zenodo archive.",

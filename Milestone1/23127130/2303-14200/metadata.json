    "abstract": "The BFSS matrix model relates flat space M-theory to a large N limit of matrix quantum mechanics describing N D0-branes. M-theory, being a theory of gravity in flat space, has a rich infrared structure that includes various soft theorems and an infinite set of conserved charges associated to asymptotic symmetries. In this work, we ask: to what extent is this infrared structure present in BFSS? We find that all the salient features concerning the infrared structure of M-theory carry over naturally to the quantum mechanics dual. Moreover, we demonstrate that the dual statement of the soft graviton theorem in the matrix model implies that D0-brane scattering amplitudes in BFSS enjoy the full 11d Lorentz symmetry of M-theory, a claim which has been long anticipated. We also offer several first-principle consistency checks for our findings, including a computation of the soft theorem which does not presuppose the BFSS duality and a non-trivial match between several known symmetries of M-theory and BFSS that appear naturally in this formalism. These calculations give non-perturbative evidence in support of the BFSS duality as a model of flat space holography.",

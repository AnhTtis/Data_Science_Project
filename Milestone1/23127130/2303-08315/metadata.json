    "abstract": "Existing electromagnetic inverse design methods are often established in the spacial domain. This communication presents an inverse design method, which can design aperture field for the desired phaseless radiation pattern, from the spectral domain perspective. In addition, it naturally adapts to the polarization constraint. Specifically, the inverse design can be converted into solving the first kind of Fredholm integral equation, using the spectral domain method. To deal with the ill-posedness of such integral equation, we apply modal expansion to the integrand. To cope with the non-linearity introduced by phaseless, we use a multi-objective optimization algorithm to obtain the coefficients in the modal expansion. Finally, we use this method to break the cosine rule that the directivity of 2D arrays drops as cosine of the angle, which is a puzzle in wide-angle scanning. The numerical simulation results meet expectations and illustrate the feasibility of the method.",

    "abstract": "We study an incompressible viscous flow around an obstacle with an oscillating boundary that moves by a translational periodic motion, and we show existence of strong time-periodic solutions for small data in different configurations: If the mean velocity of the body is zero, existence of time-periodic solutions is provided within a framework of Sobolev functions with isotropic pointwise decay. If the mean velocity is non-zero, this framework can be adapted, but the spatial behavior of flow requires a setting of anisotropically weighted spaces. In the latter case, we also establish existence of solutions within an alternative framework of homogeneous Sobolev spaces. These results are based on the time-periodic maximal regularity of the associated linearizations, which is derived from suitable R-bounds for the Stokes and Oseen resolvent problems. The pointwise estimates are deduced from the associated time-periodic fundamental solutions.",

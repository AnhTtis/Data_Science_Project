abstract = {Context:
An excessive number of code smells make a software system hard to evolve and maintain. Machine learning methods, in addition to metric-based and heuristic-based methods, have been recently applied to detect code smells; however, current methods are considered far from mature.
Objective:
First, explore the feasibility of applying deep learning models to detect smells without extensive feature engineering. Second, investigate the possibility of applying transfer-learning in the context of detecting code smells.
Methods:
We train smell detection models based on Convolution Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks as their principal hidden layers along with autoencoder models. For the first objective, we perform training and evaluation on C# samples, whereas for the second objective, we train the models from C# code and evaluate the models over Java code samples and vice-versa.
Results:
We find it feasible to detect smells using deep learning methods though the models’ performance is smell-specific. Our experiments show that transfer-learning is definitely feasible for implementation smells with performance comparable to that of direct-learning. This work opens up a new paradigm to detect code smells by transfer-learning especially for the programming languages where the comprehensive code smell detection tools are not available.}

ABSTRACT = {Context: Code smells are associated to poor design and programming style, which often degrades code quality and hampers code comprehensibility and maintainability. Goal: identify published studies that provide evidence of the influence of code smells on the occurrence of software bugs. Method: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to reach the stated goal. Results: The SLR selected studies from July 2007 to September 2017, which analyzed the source code of open source software projects and several code smells. Based on evidence of 16 studies covered in this SLR, we conclude that 24 code smells are more influential in the occurrence of bugs relative to the remaining smells analyzed. In contrast, three studies reported that at least 6 code smells are less influential in such occurrences. Evidence from the selected studies also point out tools, techniques, and procedures that should be applied to analyze the influence of the smells. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLR to target this goal. This study provides an up-to-date and structured understanding of the influence of code smells on the occurrence of software bugs based on findings systematically collected from a list of relevant references in the latest decade.},

abstract = {Context Research on code smells accelerates and there are many studies that discuss them in the machine learning context. However, while data sets used by researchers vary in quality, all which we encountered share visible shortcomings---data sets are gathered from a rather small number of often outdated projects by single individuals whose professional experience is unknown.Aim This study aims to provide a new data set that addresses the aforementioned issues and, additionally, opens new research opportunities.Method We collaborate with professional software developers (including the code quest company behind the codebeat automated code review platform integrated with GitHub) to review code samples with respect to bad smells. We do not provide additional hints as to what do we mean by a given smell, because our goal is to extract professional developers' contemporary understanding of code smells instead of imposing thresholds from the legacy literature. We gather samples from active open source projects manually verified for industry-relevance and provide repository links and revisions. Records in our MLCQ data set contain the type of smell, its severity and the exact location in source code, but do not contain any source code metrics which can be calculated using various tools. To open new research opportunities, we provide results of an extensive survey of developers involved in the study including a wide range of details concerning their professional experience in software development and many other characteristics. This allows us to track each code review to the developer's background. To the best of our knowledge, this is a unique trait of the presented data set.Conclusions The MLCQ data set with nearly 15000 code samples was created by software developers with professional experience who reviewed industry-relevant, contemporary Java open source projects. We expect that this data set should stay relevant for a longer time than data sets that base on code released years ago and, additionally, will enable researchers to investigate the relationship between developers' background and code smells' perception.},

abstract = {Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of specifying computing system configurations through code, and managing them through traditional software engineering methods. The wide adoption of configuration management and increasing size and complexity of the associated code, prompt for assessing, maintaining, and improving the configuration code's quality. In this context, traditional software engineering knowledge and best practices associated with code quality management can be leveraged to assess and manage configuration code quality. We propose a catalog of 13 implementation and 11 design configuration smells, where each smell violates recommended best practices for configuration code. We analyzed 4,621 Puppet repositories containing 8.9 million lines of code and detected the cataloged implementation and design configuration smells. Our analysis reveals that the design configuration smells show 9\% higher average co-occurrence among themselves than the implementation configuration smells. We also observed that configuration smells belonging to a smell category tend to co-occur with configuration smells belonging to another smell category when correlation is computed by volume of identified smells. Finally, design configuration smell density shows negative correlation whereas implementation configuration smell density exhibits no correlation with the size of a configuration management system.},

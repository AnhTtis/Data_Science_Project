    "abstract": "Early screening for anxiety and appropriate interventions are essential to reduce the incidence of self-harm and suicide in patients. Due to limited medical resources, traditional methods that overly rely on physician expertise and specialized equipment cannot simultaneously meet the needs for high accuracy and model interpretability. Multimodal data can provide more objective evidence for anxiety screening to improve the accuracy of models. The large amount of noise in multimodal data and the unbalanced nature of the data make the model prone to overfitting. However, it is a non-differentiable problem when high-dimensional and multimodal feature combinations are used as model inputs and incorporated into model training. This causes existing anxiety screening methods based on machine learning and deep learning to be inapplicable. Therefore, we propose a multimodal data-driven anxiety screening framework, namely MMD-AS, and conduct experiments on the collected health data of over 200 seafarers by smartphones. The proposed framework's feature extraction, dimension reduction, feature selection, and anxiety inference are jointly trained to improve the model's performance. In the feature selection step, a feature selection method based on the Improved Fireworks Algorithm is used to solve the non-differentiable problem of feature combination to remove redundant features and search for the ideal feature subset. The experimental results show that our framework outperforms the comparison methods.",

Despite the various vibronic transitions (S1(v{${'}$})~\textrightarrow ~S0(v)) available for frequency tuning of fluorescence, the molecular emissions near metals reported to date have been subject to Kasha's rule, with radiative decay from the lowest excited state (S1(0)) (refs~6\textendash 10). Here, we show resonant hot electroluminescence arising directly from higher vibronic levels of the singlet excited state (S1(v{${'}~>~$}0)) for porphyrin molecules confined inside a nanocavity in a scanning tunnelling microscope, by spectrally tuning the frequency of plasmons. We also demonstrate the generation of unexpected upconversion electroluminescence. These observations suggest that the local nanocavity plasmons behave like a strong coherent optical source with tunable energy, and can be used to actively control the radiative channels of molecular emitters by means of intense resonance enhancement of both excitation and emission.},

The fundamental mechanisms occurring at the level of a single molecule have been difficult to probe. We used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to characterize and control the fluorescence of a single zinc-phthalocyanine radical cation adsorbed on a sodium chloride\textendash covered gold (111) sample. The neutral and oxidized states of the molecule were identified on the basis of their fluorescence spectra, which revealed very different emission energies and vibronic fingerprints. The emission of the charged molecule was controlled by tuning the thickness of the insulator and the plasmons localized at the apex of the STM tip. In addition, subnanometric variations of the tip position were used to investigate the charging and electroluminescence mechanisms.},

However, the mechanism remains controversial because of the difficulty of direct observation of the chemical reactions in the plasmonic field, which is strongly localized near the metal surface. We used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to achieve real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced chemical reaction at the single-molecule level. A single dimethyl disulfide molecule on silver and copper surfaces was dissociated by the optically excited plasmon at the STM junction. The STM study combined with theoretical calculations shows that this plasmon-induced chemical reaction occurred by a direct intramolecular excitation mechanism.}

  abstract = {Scanning tunneling microscope (STM)-induced luminescence provides an ideal platform for electrical generation and the atomic-scale manipulation of nonclassical states of light. However, despite its extreme importance in quantum technologies, squeezed light emission with reduced quantum fluctuations has hitherto not been demonstrated in such a platform. Here, we theoretically predict that the emitted light from the plasmon mode can be squeezed in an STM single molecular junction subject to an external laser drive. Going beyond the traditional paradigm that generates squeezing with the quadratic interaction of photons, our prediction explores the molecular coherence involved in an anharmonic energy spectrum of a coupled plasmon\textendash molecule\textendash exciton system. Furthermore, we show that, by selectively exciting the energy ladder, the squeezed plasmon can show either sub- or super-Poissonian statistical properties. We also demonstrate that, following the same principle, the molecular excitonic mode can be squeezed simultaneously.},

The method is applied to a number of systems including one-dimensional chains, a benzene ring junction, and carbon nanotubes. Mean-field calculations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model are compared with classical molecular dynamics simulations using a generalized Langevin heat bath. We find that nonlinearity suppresses thermal transport even at moderately high temperatures.},

The atomically resolved molecular structures enable a precise determination of the characteristics of hydrogen bonding networks, including the bonding sites, orientations, and lengths. The observation of bond contrast was interpreted by ab initio density functional calculations, which indicated the electron density contribution from the hybridized electronic state of the hydrogen bond. Intermolecular coordination between the dehydrogenated 8-hq and Cu adatoms was also revealed by the submolecular resolution AFM characterization. The direct identification of local bonding configurations by NC-AFM would facilitate detailed investigations of intermolecular interactions in complex molecules with multiple active sites.}

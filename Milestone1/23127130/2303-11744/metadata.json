    "abstract": "We compute the light antiquark flavor asymmetry in the proton using the Chiral Quark Model ($χ_{\\rm QM}$). The distribution functions for the light antiquarks $\\bar{d}(x)$ and $\\bar{u}(x)$ have been extracted with the help of experimental data from NuSea/E866 and HERMES for the Bjorken$-x$ range $0.015 < x < 0.35$ as well from the most recent SeaQuest data for an extended $x$ range $0.13 < x < 0.45$. Our results on the $\\bar{d}(x)-\\bar{u}(x)$, $\\frac{\\bar{d}(x)}{\\bar{u}(x)}$ and Gottfried Integral $I_G$ are in agreement with the experimental data and confirm the presence of enhanced $\\bar{d}$ sea whose origin is purely non-perturbative based on chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the soft dipole resonance in the proton-rich nucleus $^8_6$C$_2$, which is a collective dipole oscillation of four valence protons against the $α$ core,and discuss the isospin symmetry with the mirror nucleus $^8_2$He$_6$. We use the $α+N+N+N+N$ five-body cluster model and many-body resonances are obtained using the complex-scaling method. The $1^-$ resonance of $^8_6$C$_2$ is confirmed at the excitation energy of 13 MeV with a large decay width of 24 MeV, and its structure is similar to the soft dipole resonance in $^8_2$He$_6$, such as the configuration mixing and the spatial properties. These results indicate a good isospin symmetry in the soft dipole resonances of two nuclei with a common collective excitation of multiproton and multineutron, while the ground states of two nuclei show different properties due to the Coulomb repulsion of valence protons in $^8_6$C$_2$, leading to the symmetry breaking. In conclusion, the appearance of the isospin symmetry differs depending on the states of $^8_6$C$_2$ and $^8_2$He$_6$.",

   abstract = {The paper presents a two-stage approach for designing optimal reconfiguration maneuvers for multiple spacecraft in close proximity. These maneuvers involve well-coordinated and highly-coupled motions of the entire fleet of spacecraft while satisfying an arbitrary number of constraints. This problem is complicated by the nonlinearity of the attitude dynamics, the non-convexity of some of the constraints, and the coupling that exists in some of the constraints between the positions and attitudes of all spacecraft. While there has been significant research to solve for the translation and/or rotation trajectories for the multiple spacecraft reconfiguration problem, the approach presented in this paper is more general and on a larger scale than the problems considered previously. The essential feature of the solution approach is the separation into two stages, the first using a simplified planning approach to obtain a feasible solution, which is then significantly improved using a smoothing stage. The first stage is solved using a bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner. Then the second step optimizes the trajectories by solving an optimal control problem using the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM). Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for designing spacecraft reconfiguration maneuvers.},

   abstract = {A pseudospectral method, called the Gauss pseudospectral method, for solving nonlinear op- timal control problems is presented. In the method presented here, orthogonal collocation of the dynamics is performed at the Legendre-Gauss points. This form of orthogonal collocation leads a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) whose Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) multipliers can be mapped to the costates of the continuous-time optimal control problem. In particular the Legendre-Gauss collocation leads to a costate mapping at the boundary points. The method is demonstrated on an example problem where it is shown that highly accurate costates are ob- tained. The results presented in this paper show that the Gauss pseudospectral method is a viable apprach for direct trajectory optimization and costate estimation.},

Space exploration provided the impetus by presenting scientists and engineers with challenging technical problems. The digital computer provided the tool for solving these new problems. The goal of this paper is to review the state of the art in the field loosely referred to as trajectory optimization. Presenting a survey of a field as diverse as trajectory optimization is a daunting task. The author focuses on the two types of methods most widely used today, namely, direct and indirect. I begin the discussion with a brief review of the underlying mathematics in both direct and indirect methods. I then discuss the complications that occur when path and boundary constraints are imposed on the problem description. Finally, I describe unresolved issues that are the subject of ongoing research},

   abstract = {Given a set of n vertices in the plane together with a set of noncrossing edges, the constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) is the triangulation of the vertices with the following properties: (1) the prespecified edges are included in the triangulation, and (2) it is as close as possible to the Delaunay triangulation. We show that the CDT can be built in optimal O(n log n) time using a divide-and-conquer technique. This matches the time required to build an arbitrary (unconstrained) Delaunay triangulation and the time required to build an arbitrary constrained (nonDelaunay) triangulation. CDTs, because of their relationship with Delaunay triangulations, have a number of properties that should make them useful for the finite-element method. Applications also include motion planning in the presence of polygonal obstacles in the plane and constrained Euclidean minimum spanning trees, spanning trees subject to the restriction that some edges are prespecified.},

   abstract = {There has been significant progress in the development of numerical methods for the determination of optimal trajectories for continuous dynamic systems, especially in the last 20 years. In the 1980s, the principal contribution was new methods for discretizing the continuous system and converting the optimization problem into a nonlinear programming problem. This has been a successful approach that has yielded optimal trajectories for very sophisticated problems. In the last 15–20 years, researchers have applied a qualitatively different approach, using evolutionary algorithms or metaheuristics, to solve similar parameter optimization problems. Evolutionary algorithms use the principle of “survival of the fittest” applied to a population of individuals representing candidate solutions for the optimal trajectories. Metaheuristics optimize by iteratively acting to improve candidate solutions, often using stochastic methods. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of these recently developed methods are described and an attempt is made to answer the question of what is now the best extant numerical solution method.},

   abstract = {In this article, we present a new strategy to determine an unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory that minimizes its flight time in presence of avoidance areas and obstacles. The method combines classical results from optimal control theory, i.e. the Euler-Lagrange Theorem and the Pontryagin Minimum Principle, with a continuation technique that dynamically adapts the solution curve to the presence of obstacles. We initially consider the two-dimensional path planning problem and then move to the three-dimensional one, and include numerical illustrations for both cases to show the efficiency of our approach.},

   abstract = {A new methodology for creating highly accurate, static nonlinear maps from scattered, multivariate data is presented. This new methodology uses the B-form polynomials of multivariate simplex splines in a new linear regression scheme. This allows the use of standard parameter estimation techniques for estimating the B-coefficients of the multivariate simplex splines. We present a generalized least squares estimator for the B-coefficients, and show how the estimated B-coefficient variances lead to a new model quality assessment measure in the form of the B-coefficient variance surface. The new modeling methodology is demonstrated on a nonlinear scattered bivariate dataset. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We first assume that the target is stationary and propose an estimator to localize the target and a control law that forces the agent to move on a circular trajectory around the target such that both the estimator and the control system are exponentially stable. Then the case where the target might experience slow but possibly steady movement is studied.},

   abstract = {A unified framework is presented for the numerical solution of optimal control problems using collocation at LegendreGauss (LG), LegendreGaussRadau (LGR), and LegendreGaussLobatto (LGL) points. It is shown that the LG and LGR differentiation matrices are rectangular and full rank whereas the LGL differentiation matrix is square and singular. Consequently, the LG and LGR schemes can be expressed equivalently in either differential or integral form, while the LGL differential and integral forms are not equivalent. Transformations are developed that relate the Lagrange multipliers of the discrete nonlinear programming problem to the costates of the continuous optimal control problem. The LG and LGR discrete costate systems are full rank while the LGL discrete costate system is rank-deficient. The LGL costate approximation is found to have an error that oscillates about the true solution and this error is shown by example to be due to the null space in the LGL discrete costate system. An example is considered to assess the accuracy and features of each collocation scheme. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This work develops and analyzes a control algorithm for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to circumnavigate an unknown target at a fixed radius when the UAV is unable to determine its location and heading. Using a relationship between range-rate and bearing angle (from the target), we formulate a control algorithm that uses the range-rate as a proxy for the bearing angle and adjusts the heading of the UAV accordingly. We consider the addition of measurement errors and model the system with a stochastic differential equation to carry out the analysis. A recurrence result is proven, establishing that the UAV will reach a neighborhood of the desired orbit in finite time, and a mollified control is presented to eliminate a portion of the recurrent set about the origin. Simulation studies are presented to support the analysis and compare the performance against other algorithms for the circumnavigation task.},

Besides revealing connections between the minimum paths under these three distance functions, the framework provided by the universal cover leads to simplified linear-time algorithms for shortest path trees, for minimum-link paths in simple polygons, and for paths restricted to c given orientations. ?? 1994.},

   abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to systematically evaluate the current state of research on human-system interfaces for users controlling semi-autonomous swarms composed of groups of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAV swarms pose several human factors challenges, such as high cognitive demands, non-intuitive behavior, and serious consequences for errors. This article presents findings from a meta-analysis of 27 UAV swarm management papers focused on the human-system interface and human factors concerns, providing an overview of the advantages, challenges, and limitations of current UAV management interfaces, as well as information on how these interfaces are currently evaluated. In general allowing user and mission-specific customization to user interfaces and raising the swarm's level of autonomy to reduce operator cognitive workload are beneficial and improve situation awareness (SA). It is clear more research is needed in this rapidly evolving field.},

   abstract = {As optimal control problems become increasingly complex, innovative numerical methods are needed to solve them. Direct transcription methods, and in particular, methods involving orthogonal collocation have become quite popular in several field areas due to their high accuracy in approximating non-analytic solutions with relatively few discretization points. Several of these methods, known as pseudospectral methods in the aerospace engineering community, have also established costate estimation procedures which can be used to verify the optimality of the resulting solution. This work examines three of these pseudospectral methods in detail, specifically the Legendre, Gauss, and Radau pseudospectral methods, in order to assess their accuracy, efficiency, and applicability to optimal control problems of varying complexity. Emphasis is placed on improving the Gauss pseudospectral method, where advancements to the method include a revised pseudospectral transcription for problems with path constraints and differential dynamic constraints, a new algorithm for the computation of the control at the boundaries, and an analysis of a local versus global implementation of the method. The Gauss pseudospectral method is then applied to solve current problems in the area of tetrahedral spacecraft formation flying. These optimal control problems involve multiple finite-burn maneuvers, nonlinear dynamics, and nonlinear inequality path constraints that depend on both the relative and inertial positions of all four spacecraft. Contributions of this thesis include an improved numerical method for solving optimal control problems, an analysis and numerical comparison of several other competitive direct methods, and a greater understanding of the relative motion of tetrahedral formation flight.},

It begins with a comprehensive study and comparison of the various path planning methods currently in use. It then provides an analysis of the optimal control method, including vehicle and obstacle modeling techniques, several different problem formulations, and a number of important insights on unmanned ground vehicle motion planning. The new algorithm is then utilized on a collection of motion planning scenarios with varying levels of information; the performance of the planner and the solution accuracies under these varying levels of information are studied for both single and multi-vehicle scenarios. The multi-vehicle scenarios compare and contrast centralized, decentralized, decoupled, coordinated, cooperative, and prioritized control methods. Finally, the versatility of the planner (and the optimal control technique) is demonstrated, as it is used as both a path follower and trajectory planner in a collection of scenarios, including multi-vehicle formations and sector keeping.},

   abstract = {To support the U.S. Air Force's global reach concept, a Common Aero Vehicle is being designed to support the global strike mission. Waypoints are specified for reconnaissance or multiple payload deployments and no-fly zones are specified for geopolitical restrictions or threat avoidance. Because of time critical targets and multiple scenario analysis, an autonomous solution is preferred over a time-intensive, manually iterative one. Thus, a real-time or near real-time autonomous trajectory optimization technique is presented to minimize the fight time, satisfy terminal and intermediate constraints, and remain within the specified vehicle heating and control limitations. This research uses the hypersonic cruise vehicle as a simplified two-dimensional platform to compute an optimal analytical solution. An up-and-coming numerical technique is a direct solution method involving discretization and then dualization, with pseudospectral methods and nonlinear programming used to converge to the optimal solution. This numerical technique is first compared to the previously derived 2-D hypersonic cruise vehicle analytical results to demonstrate convergence to the optimal solution. Then, the numerical approach is applied to the 3-D Common Aero Vehicle as the test platform for the flat Earth three-dimensional reentry trajectory optimization problem. The culmination of this research is the verification of the optimality of this proposed numerical technique, as shown for both the two dimensional and three-dimensional models. Additionally, user implementation strategies are presented to improve accuracy, enhance solution convergence, and facilitate autonomous implementation. Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.},

   abstract = {The Local Clearance Triangulation (LCT) of polygonal obstacles is a cell decomposition designed for the efficient computation of locally shortest paths with clearance. This article presents a revised definition of LCTs, new theoretical results and optimizations, and new algorithms introducing dynamic updates and robustness. Given an input obstacle set with n vertices, a theoretical analysis is proposed showing that LCTs generate a triangular decomposition of O(n) cells, guaranteeing that discrete search algorithms can compute paths in optimal times. In addition, several examples are presented indicating that the number of triangles is low in practice, close to 2n, and a new technique is described for reducing the number of triangles when the maximum query clearance is known in advance. Algorithms for repairing the local clearance property dynamically are also introduced, leading to efficient LCT updates for addressing dynamic changes in the obstacle set. Dynamic updates automatically handle intersecting and overlapping segments with guaranteed robustness, using techniques that combine one exact geometric predicate with adjustment of illegal floating-point coordinates. The presented results demonstrate that LCTs are efficient and highly flexible for representing dynamic polygonal environments with clearance information.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of efficiently computing optimal paths of arbitrary clearance from a polygonal representation of a given virtual environment. Key to the proposed method is a new type of triangulated navigation mesh, called a Local Clearance Triangulation, which enables the efficient and correct determination if a disc of arbitrary size can pass through any narrow passages of the mesh. The proposed approach uniquely balances speed of computation and optimality of paths by first computing high-quality locally shortest paths efficiently in optimal time. Only in case global optimality is needed, an extended search will gradually improve the current path (if not already the global optimal) until the globally shortest one is determined. The presented method represents the first solution correctly extracting shortest paths of arbitrary clearance directly from a triangulated environment.},

   abstract = {The ever-increasing applicability of interactive virtual worlds in industry and academia has given rise to the need for robust, versatile autonomous virtual humans to inject life into these environments. There are two fundamental problems that must be addressed to produce functional, purposeful autonomous populaces: (1)Navigation: finding a collision-free global path from an agent's start position to its target in large complex environments, and (2) Steering: moving an agent along the path while avoiding static and dynamic threats such as other agents. In this review, we survey the large body of contributions in steering and navigation for autonomous agents in dynamic virtual worlds. We describe the benefits and limitations of different proposed solutions and identify potential future research directions to meet the needs for the next generation of interactive virtual world applications.

   abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is\r\npresented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a\r\nquery phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is\r\nconstructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to\r\ncollision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible\r\npaths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a\r\nsimple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and\r\ngoal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the\r\nroadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two\r\nnodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to\r\nvirtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain\r\nparameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values\r\ndepend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these\r\nvalues turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency\r\ncan also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g.,\r\nthe local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is\r\napplied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom.\r\nExperimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction\r\nof a second on a contemporary workstation (&amp;ap;150 MIPS), after learning\r\nfor relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds)},

Ground-based and rotary-wing aerial vehicles can be staged at their mission initial conditions until a mission is commenced but fixed-wing aerial vehicles, which must maintain a minimum forward airspeed at all times, can only be positioned approximately. A computationally simple algorithm for these vehicles that determines simultaneous arrival paths from arbitrary starting points is presented. The algorithm is based on planar B-spline curves so that fully defined feasible trajectories can be quickly determined, compactly encoded, and precisely executed. © 2014 IEEE.},

We consider formulation and give solution to the problems of monitoring, flying over territories and extinguishing fires as task of delivering a payload to target points. The expediency of using unmanned aerial vehicles capable to monitor and participate directly in extinguishing fires in the presence of wind loads and impassable obstacles is shown. A heuristic search algorithm is developed that allows planning locally optimal routes for flying around the given area. We consider the route planning problem, which is complicated by the presence of wind flows affecting the speed and trajectory of a UAV. We conduct experimental studies in MATLAB Simulink program simulating the solution to the problem of flying around given area containing obstacles with the use of the mathematical models of a UAV and wind disturbances.},

   abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) as a randomized data structure that is designed for a broad class of path planning problems. While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

This problem had been solved earlier for polygonal obstacles with the aid of the visibility graph. This approach however, has an Ω(n2) time lower bound, if n is the total number of vertices of the obstacles. Our goal is to find interesting cases for which the solution can be obtained without the explicit construction of the entire visibility graph. The two cases are (i) the path must lie within an n-vertex simple polygon; (ii) the obstacles are n disjoint and parallel line segments. In both instances greedy O(n log n) time algorithms can be developed which solve the problems by constructing the shortest-path tree from the source to all the vertices of the obstacles and to the destination.},

The vehicle was assumed to be an air-breathing reconnaissance aircraft that has specified takeoff/landing locations, airborne refueling constraints, specified no-fly zones, and specified targets for sensor data collections. The aircraft model included fight dynamics, aerodynamics, and thermal constraints. This model was incorporated into an optimal control formulation that includes constraints on both the vehicle as well as mission parameters, such as avoidance of no-fly zones and coverage of high-value targets. Optimal trajectories were be developed using several different performance costs in the optimal control formulation--minimum time, minimum time with control penalties, and maximum range. The resulting analysis demonstrated that optimal trajectories that meet specified mission parameters and constraints can be determined and used for larger-scale operational and campaign planning.},

   abstract = {Preface This document serves a user's guide for Version 2.0 of the MATLAB optimal control software GPOPS − II: a general-pupose software for solving optimal control problems using variable-order adaptive orthogonal collocation methods together with sparse nonlinear programming. The class of problems that GPOPS − II can solve is very broad and include applications in engineering, economics, and medicine. GPOPS − II uses some of the latest advancements in the area of orthogonal collocation methods along with the state-of-the-art in nonlinear optimization. Specifically, GPOPS − II employs a variable-order adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature collocation method. GPOPS − II has been designed to work with the nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers SNOPT and IPOPT, and MATLAB mex files for IPOPT are included with the software (users must obtain SNOPT on their own, but the complete interface for using SNOPT is included with GPOPS − II. The software has been designed to be extremely flexible, allowing a user to formulate an optimal control problem in a way that makes sense for the problem being solved. Few, if any, restrictions have been placed on the manner in which a problem needs to be modeled. As stated, the software is general-purpose, that is, it has not been developed for any specific type of problem. While the developers of GPOPS − II make no guarantee as to the fitness of the software for any particular purpose, it is certainly hoped that software is useful for a variety of applications. The new version of GPOPS − II described in this user's guide differs from the first release of May 2013 in the follows ways. First, some of the input syntax has been modified to be more elegant than it was previously. Second, the software now includes a complete input checker that provides errors and warnings regarding user-defined inputs. Third, from an algorithmic standpoint the major change is the way in which NLP solver derivatives can now be obtained. In addition to the original sparse finite-differencing method (which is still included), the user now has the choice of generating derivative source code using the open-source automatic differentiation software ADiGator 1 (written by Matthew J. Weinstein and available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/adigator) or by providing user-supplied (analytic) derivatives. These improvements have been made to increase both computational efficiency and reliability of the software.},

   abstract = {We study the problem of computing conditional probabilities, a fundamental operation in statistics and machine learning. In the elementary discrete setting, a ratio of probabilities defines conditional probability. In the abstract setting, conditional probability is defined axiomatically and the search for more constructive definitions is the subject of a rich literature in probability theory and statistics. In the discrete or dominated setting, under suitable computability hypotheses, conditional probabilities are computable. However, we show that in general one cannot compute conditional probabilities. We do this by constructing a pair of computable random variables in the unit interval whose conditional distribution encodes the halting problem at almost every point. We show that this result is tight, in the sense that given an oracle for the halting problem, one can compute this conditional distribution. On the other hand, we show that conditioning in abstract settings is computable in the presence of certain additional structure, such as independent absolutely continuous noise.},

   abstract = {The advent of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) has created opportunities for expensive capital assets to be replaced by these small, yet capable, platforms. Tasks that are identified as able to be performed by UAS may also benefit from the ability of a collection of UAS to operate in a cooperative and parallel manner. Parallelization also means that several parts of the search area can be covered at the same time, reducing the overall task completion time. In this paper we investigate how to divide the maritime search and rescue task in a way that it can be performed by a set of UAS. Our investigation covers the detection of multiple mobile objects by a heterogeneous collection of UAS. Three methods (two that are not informed by object location probabilities and one that is) for dividing the space are proposed, and their relative strengths and weaknesses investigated. To facilitate simulation a model for object detection by an aerial camera is proposed. The topic is approached holisti-cally to account for contingencies such as airspace deconfliction. Results are produced using simulation to verify the capability of the proposed method and to compare the various partitioning methods. Results from this simulation show that great gains in search efficiency can be made when the search space is partitioned using a method based on object location probability. For search areas of 3km x 3km detection probability gains of 40 percent are achievable. For larger areas these gains can approach 80 percent.},

For N points distri-buted randomly within a square domain, the expected run time for the algorithm is approxi-mately 0(NS/4). Empirical tests, for N up to 10 000, indicate that the actual run time is substantially less than this prediction and is generally better than 0(NX'a). Excluding the memory required to store the co-ordinates, the algorithm requires slightly greater than 14N words of integer memory to complete a typical triangulation. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing its performance with other Delaunay triangulation procedures. Uses of the algorithm include the generation of f'mite element meshes and the con-struction of contour plots.},

   abstract = {Dijkstra’s Algorithm is one of the most popular algo- rithms in computer science. It is also popular in operations research. It is generally viewed and presented as a greedy algorithm. In this paper we attempt to change this perception by providing a dynamic programming perspective on the algorithm. In particular, we are re- minded that this famous algorithm is strongly inspired by Bellman’s Principle of Optimality and that both conceptually and technically it constitutes a dynamic programming successive approximation pro- cedure par excellence. One of the immediate implications of this perspective is that this popular algorithm can be incorporated in the dynamic programming syllabus and in turn dynamic program- ming should be (at least) alluded to in a proper exposition/teaching of the algorithm},

   abstract = {Several potentially important science targets have been observed in extreme terrains (steep or vertical slopes, possibly covered in loose soil or granular media) on other planets. Robots which can access these extreme terrains will likely use tethers to provide climbing and stabilizing force. To prevent tether entanglement during descent and subsequent ascent through such terrain, a motion planning procedure is needed. Abad-Manterola, Nesnas, and Burdick [1] previously presented such a motion planner for the case in which the geometry of the terrain is known a priori with high precision. Their algorithm finds ascent/descent paths of fixed homotopy, which minimizes the likelihood of tether entanglement. This paper presents an extension of the algorithm to the case where the terrain is poorly known prior to the start of the descent. In particular, we develop new results for how the discovery of previously unknown obstacles modifies the homotopy classes underlying the motion planning problem. We also present a planning algorithm which takes the modified homotopy into account. An example illustrates the methodology.},

This hands-on introduction is built around forty short and powerful MATLAB programs, which the reader can download from the World Wide Web. This book presents the key ideas along with many figures, examples, and short, elegant MATLAB programs for readers to adapt to their own needs. It covers ODE and PDE boundary value problems, eigenvalues and pseudospectra, linear and nonlinear waves, and numerical quadrature.},

   abstract = {© 2016 ACM.A navigation mesh is a representation of a 2D or 3D virtual environment that enables path planning and crowd simulation for walking characters. Various state-of-the-art navigation meshes exist, but there is no standardized way of evaluating or comparing them. Each implementation is in a different state of maturity, has been tested on different hardware, uses different example environments, and may have been designed with a different application in mind. In this paper, we conduct the first comparative study of navigation meshes. First, we give general definitions of 2D and 3D environments and navigation meshes. Second, we propose theoretical properties by which navigation meshes can be classified. Third, we introduce metrics by which the quality of a navigation mesh implementation can be measured objectively. Finally, we use these metrics to compare various state-of-the-art navigation meshes in a range of 2D and 3D environments. We expect that this work will set a new standard for the evaluation of navigation meshes, that it will help developers choose an appropriate navigation mesh for their application, and that it will steer future research on navigation meshes in interesting directions.},

   abstract = {A novel method for aircraft system identification is presented that is based on a new multivariate spline type; the multivariate multiplex B-spline. The multivariate multiplex B-spline is a generalization of the recently introduced tensor-simplex B-spline. Multivari-ate multiplex splines obtain similar or better approximation accuracy using less parameters (B-coefficients) than standard multivariate simplex B-splines which are currently used for aircraft system identification. The multiplex spline allows the user to incorporate a-priori knowledge of the modelled system in the definition of the model structure. In particular, while the standard simplex B-splines use a multi-dimensional triangulation in which all dimensions are coupled, the multiplex spline enables the user to decouple specific model dimensions based on expert knowledge of the system. The new method is used to ap-proximate a 4-dimensional nonlinear quadrotor inflow dataset. The results show that the multiplex B-spline obtains a relative root mean square error of 0.672% using 1440 B-coefficients. This compares favorably to results obtained with the standard 4-dimensional simplex B-spline on the same dataset, which resulted in an relative root mean square error of 1.608% using 1540 B-coefficients.

   abstract = {In this paper we provide an extension of barycentric coordinates from simplices to arbitrary convex sets. Barycentric coordinates over convex 2D polygons have found numerous applications in various fields as they allow smooth interpolation of data located on vertices. However, no explicit formulation valid for arbitrary convex polytopes has been proposed to extend this interpolation in higher dimensions. Moreover, there has been no attempt to extend these functions into the continuous domain, where barycentric coordinates are related to Green’s functions and construct functions that satisfy a boundary value problem. First, we review the properties and construction of barycentric coordinates in the discrete domain for convex polytopes. Next, we show how these concepts extend into the continuous domain to yield barycentric coordinates for continuous functions. We then provide a proof that our functions satisfy all the desirable properties of barycentric coordinates in arbitrary dimensions. Finally, we provide an example of constructing such barycentric functions over regions bounded by parametric curves and show how they can be used to perform freeform deformations.},

   abstract = {Querying visible points is a fundamental problem in computational geometry and spatial databases. With the development of new applications such as trip planning and near-est neighbors, querying visible points plays a key role in obstacle space and the result can be further used such as defining the shortest path. Thereby, efficiently finding the result is essentially important. However, the performance of current methods decrease substan-tially for large datasets. To solve the problem, we proposes a new and fast algorithm to find visible points for an arbitrary query location inside a large polygon containing obsta-cles. The method is based on polygon triangulation. By decomposing the polygon into a set of triangles, we manage the polygon by organizing triangles in an efficient way instead of maintaining a large number of vertices. We propose a data structure to partition the search-ing space into several parts, each of which is independently processed. Afterwards, by recursively calling a method we search visible points by accessing triangles and return the result in a progressive way. Through a theoretical analysis, assuming the polygon contains N vertices in total, the time complexity of our algorithm is O(N), improving the exist-ing method O(NlogN). We prove the correctness of the algorithm and analyze the space complexity, which is O(N). The technique is extended to return visible points less than a threshold distance to the query location. Using both synthetic and real datasets, we perform extensive experiments to test our algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness. Visible points are efficiently processed in a large obstacle space with over one million ver-tices. Experimental results show that our technique gains more than one order of magnitude speedup compared to competitive methods using large datasets.},

   abstract = {This work proposes a fast algorithm for generating obstacle-free and wind-efficient flight paths at a constant above-ground-level altitude in urban environments, because a fast flight path planning algorithm is an essential function or service needed for enabling small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) to operate in urban environments within Class G airspace. The proposed method first converts the 3D path planning problem to a 2D problem by constructing an obstacle map at a given above-ground-level altitude. A quad-tree decomposition is then used to build a search space in terms of obstacle occupancy and wind difference. The wind cost of traveling through each cell is defined based on energy consumption under various wind conditions. A repulsive potential is also adopted to make sure the flight plans stay away from obstacles. The Theta* search algorithm, a variant of A* algorithm, is applied to mitigate the path angle change constraints introduced by grid-based graphs. With the Theta* and post smoothing techniques, an obstacle-free, wind efficient, and constant above-ground-level flight plan can be quickly generated for small UAV operations in urban environments while meeting the lateral path angle constraints. The results showed that the path planning algorithm is efficient and can be finished within several seconds. With a proper choice of wind coefficient, the proposed path planning algorithm outperforms the multiple-shooting trajectory optimization method even in an obstacle-free environment. With the flexibility of incorporating other geo-related costs and the efficiency in computation, the proposed algorithm shows potential for real-time flight path planning in complex urban environments.},

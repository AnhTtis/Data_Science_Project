These studies are an exciting chance to learn about one system by studying the other. Here, we propose ideas on how to design, conduct, and interpret experiments such that they adequately support the investigation of mechanisms when comparing human and machine perception. We demonstrate and apply these ideas through three case studies. The first case study shows how human bias can affect the interpretation of results and that several analytic tools can help to overcome this human reference point. In the second case study, we highlight the difference between necessary and sufficient mechanisms in visual reasoning tasks. Thereby, we show that contrary to previous suggestions, feedback mechanisms might not be necessary for the tasks in question. The third case study highlights the importance of aligning experimental conditions. We find that a previously observed difference in object recognition does not hold when adapting the experiment to make conditions more equitable between humans and machines. In presenting a checklist for comparative studies of visual reasoning in humans and machines, we hope to highlight how to overcome potential pitfalls in design and inference. }",

	abstract = {The contrast sensitivity function (CSF) is a fundamental signature of the visual system that has been measured extensively in several species. It is defined by the visibility threshold for sinusoidal gratings at all spatial frequencies. Here, we investigated the CSF in deep neural networks using the same 2AFC contrast detection paradigm as in human psychophysics. We examined 240 networks pretrained on several tasks. To obtain their corresponding CSFs, we trained a linear classifier on top of the extracted features from frozen pretrained networks. The linear classifier is exclusively trained on a contrast discrimination task with natural images. It has to find which of the two input images has higher contrast. The network{\textquoteright}s CSF is measured by detecting which one of two images contains a sinusoidal grating of varying orientation and spatial frequency. Our results demonstrate characteristics of the human CSF are manifested in deep networks both in the luminance channel (a band-limited inverted U-shaped function) and in the chromatic channels (two low-pass functions of similar properties). The exact shape of the networks{\textquoteright} CSF appears to be task-dependent. The human CSF is better captured by networks trained on low-level visual tasks such as image-denoising or autoencoding. However, human-like CSF also emerges in mid- and high-level tasks such as edge detection and object recognition. Our analysis shows that human-like CSF appears in all architectures but at different depths of processing, some at early layers, while others in intermediate and final layers. Overall, these results suggest that (i) deep networks model the human CSF faithfully, making them suitable candidates for applications of image quality and compression, (ii) efficient/purposeful processing of the natural world drives the CSF shape, and (iii) visual representation from all levels of visual hierarchy contribute to the tuning curve of the CSF, in turn implying a function which we intuitively think of as modulated by low-level visual features may arise as a consequence of pooling from a larger set of neurons at all levels of the visual system.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Saturation discrimination is assumed to be dependent on the ratio of chromatic to achromatic components in the sensory response to a given wavelength. The usual methods of measurement do not, however, permit independent control of the chromatic and achromatic variables. On the basis of an opponent-colors theory of vision, a method is described for measuring directly and separately the spectral distributions of the chromatic components. A series of experiments is reported in which this method was used to obtain measures of the paired chromatic responses associated with the four primary spectral hues. Results are reported for two observers, 1{\textdegree} foveal test field, for an equal brightness spectrum (10 mL), and a neutral state of adaptation (10 mL). The measured chromatic responses, together with achromatic (luminosity) functions measured earlier for the same observers, are used to predict the form of the spectral saturation discrimination function.},

abstract="The same scene viewed under two different illuminants induces two different colour images. If the two illuminants are the same colour but are placed at different positions then corresponding rgb pixels are related by simple scale factors. In contrast if the lighting geometry is held fixed but the colour of the light changes then it is the individual colour channels (e.g. all the red pixel values or all the green pixels) that are a scaling apart. It is well known that the image dependencies due to lighting geometry and illuminant colour can be respectively removed by normalizing the magnitude of the rgb pixel triplets (e.g. by calculating chromaticities) and by normalizing the lengths of each colour channel (by running the `grey-world' colour constancy algorithm). However, neither normalization suffices to account for changes in both the lighting geometry and illuminant colour.",

	abstract = {In this work, we analyse and compare several linear and nonlinear colour representation spaces at different physiological levels, show the relationships between spaces and discuss the mathematical properties they should exhibit. At the photoreceptor level, we examine the cone excitation and the cone contrast spaces. We discuss the second-stage spaces, usually known as ATD- spaces, paying particular attention to Boynton's space and including a nonlinear space, the opponent modulation space. In addition, we approach third-stage transformations, which might take place at the cortical level. Finally, we analyse a perceptual ATD-type space, discussing how it might be derived as a third-stage transformation of an LGN-based ATD-space.

Résumé. Dans ce travail, nous analysons et comparons divers espaces linéaires et non linéaires de représentation de la couleur relativement à différents niveaux physiologiques, en montrant des relations entre espaces et en discutant quelles propriétés mathémathiques doivent posséder. Au niveau des photorécepteurs nous examinons l'espace d'excitation des cônes et l'espace de contraste des cônes. Parmi les espaces à deux niveaux, connus habituellement sous le nom d'espaces ATD, nous étudions notamment l'espace de Boynton et un espace nonlinear, l'espace des modulations opposantes. Nous considérons aussi les transformations de troisième niveau qui ont lieu au niveau cortical. Finallement, nous analysons un espace perceptif du type ATD, en discutant comment un tel espace pourrait être obtenu comme une transformée de troisième niveau d'un espace ATD basé sur le NGL.

abstract = {The red, green, yellow, and blue curve portions of chromatic valence functions (CVFs) were measured by an iso-cancellation technique using three or four different chromatic standards (cancellation stimuli of fixed intensity and chromaticity) for each of the four curve portions. Curve shapes of the red, green, and yellow CVF portions varied with different chromatic standards, while that of blue did not. These results of chromatic standard dependency in CVFs are discussed with respect to opponent equilibria in a color mixture space.}

abstract = {Thresholds for detecting changes in color are raised following viewing a field sinusoidally modulated in color over time. This effect is highly selective. For example, thresholds for detecting reddish and greenish changes from white are raised following viewing a field varying in a reddishgreenish direction, but not after viewing one varying in a yellowish-bluish direction. Similarly thresholds for yellowish and bluish changes from white are raised following viewing a field varying along a yellowish-bluish axis but are not altered by exposure to reddish-greenish variation. Thresholds for chromatic changes are not raised following viewing a field varying in luminance. Thresholds for changes in luminance are raised following viewing a field varying in luminance but not altered by exposure to purely chromatic variation. Since this selectivity is found only for these directions and not intermediate directions in color space we conclude that these directions are cardinal, that is, signals varying along these directions are carried along separate, fatiguable, second stage pathways. The results conform to the expectations of opponent process theory with the important exception that the yellowish-bluish cardinal direction is a tritanopic confusion line and not a red-green equilibrium line.}

volume = {357},
number = {1},
pages = {241-265},
abstract = {This paper introduces a new technique for the analysis of the chromatic properties of neurones, and applies it to cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) of macaque. The method exploits the fact that for any cell that combines linearly the signals from cones there is a restricted set of lights to which it is equally sensitive, and whose members can be exchanged for one another without evoking a response. Stimuli are represented in a three-dimensional space defined by an axis along which only luminance varies, without change in chromaticity, a 'constant B' axis along which chromaticity varies without changing the excitation of blue-sensitive (B) cones, a 'constant R \& G' axis along which chromaticity varies without change in the excitation of red-sensitive (R) or green-sensitive (G) cones. The orthogonal axes intersect at a white point. The isoluminant plane defined by the intersection of the 'constant B' and 'constant R \& G' axes contains lights that vary only in chromaticity. In polar coordinates the constant B axis is assigned the azimuth 0-180 deg, and the constant R \& G axis the azimuth 90-270 deg. Luminance is expressed as elevation above or below the isoluminant plane (-90 to +90 deg). For any cell that combines cone signals linearly, there is one plane in this space, passing through the white point, that contains all lights that can be exchanged silently. The position of this 'null plane' provides the 'signature' of the cell, and is specified by its azimuth (the direction in which it intersects the isoluminant plane of the stimulus space) and its elevation (its angle of inclination to the isoluminant plane). A colour television receiver was used to produce sinusoidal gratings whose chromaticity and luminance could be modulated along any vector passing through the white point in the space described. The spatial and temporal frequencies of modulation could be varied over a large range. When stimulated by patterns of low spatial and low temporal frequency, two groups of cells in the parvocellular laminae of the l.g.n. were distinguished by the locations of their null planes. The null planes of the larger group were narrowly distributed about an azimuth of 92.6 deg and more broadly about an elevation of 51.5 deg, which suggests that they receive opposed, but not equally balanced, inputs from only R and G cones. These we call R-G cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The data are expressed most simply in a logarithmic response space, wherein an orthogonal decorrelation robustly produces three principal axes, one corresponding to simple changes in radiance and two that are reminiscent of the blue--yellow and red--green chromatic-opponent mechanisms found in the primate visual system. Further inclusion of spatial stimulus dimensions demonstrates a complete spatial decorrelation of these three cone-space axes in natural cone responses.},

    abstract = {In vision science, cascades of Linear+Nonlinear transforms are very successful in modeling a number of perceptual experiences. However, the conventional literature is usually too focused on only describing the forward input-output transform. Instead, in this work we present the mathematics of such cascades beyond the forward transform, namely the Jacobian matrices and the inverse. The fundamental reason for this analytical treatment is that it offers useful analytical insight into the psychophysics, the physiology, and the function of the visual system. For instance, we show how the trends of the sensitivity (volume of the discrimination regions) and the adaptation of the receptive fields can be identified in the expression of the Jacobian w.r.t. the stimulus. This matrix also tells us which regions of the stimulus space are encoded more efficiently in multi-information terms. The Jacobian w.r.t. the parameters shows which aspects of the model have bigger impact in the response, and hence their relative relevance. The analytic inverse implies conditions for the response and model parameters to ensure appropriate decoding. From the experimental and applied perspective, (a) the Jacobian w.r.t. the stimulus is necessary in new experimental methods based on the synthesis of visual stimuli with interesting geometrical properties, (b) the Jacobian matrices w.r.t. the parameters are convenient to learn the model from classical experiments or alternative goal optimization, and (c) the inverse is a promising model-based alternative to blind machine-learning methods for neural decoding that do not include meaningful biological information. The theory is checked by building and testing a vision model that actually follows a modular Linear+Nonlinear program. Our illustrative derivable and invertible model consists of a cascade of modules that account for brightness, contrast, energy masking, and wavelet masking. To stress the generality of this modular setting we show examples where some of the canonical Divisive Normalization modules are substituted by equivalent modules such as the Wilson-Cowan interaction model (at the V1 cortex) or a tone-mapping model (at the retina).},

abstract = {The stabilized contrast-sensitivity function measured at a constant retinal velocity is tuned to a particular spatial frequency, which is inversely related to the velocity chosen. The Fourier transforms of these constant-velocity passbands have the same form as retinal receptive fields of various sizes. At low velocities, in the range of the natural drift motions of the eye, the stabilized contrast-sensitivity function matches the normal, unstabilized result. At higher velocities (corresponding to motions of objects in the environment), this curve maintains the same shape but shifts toward lower spatial frequencies. The constant-velocity passband is displaced across the spatio-temporal frequency domain in a manner that is almost symmetric about the constant-velocity plane at $\nu$ $=$ 2 deg/s. Interpolating these diagonal profiles by a suitable analytic expression, we construct the spatio-temporal threshold surface for stabilized vision, and display its properties in terms of the usual frequency parameters; e.g., at low spatial frequencies, the temporal response becomes nearly independent of spatial frequency, while at low temporal frequencies, the spatial response becomes independent of temporal frequency.},

    "abstract": "In functionally graded materials (FGMs) fabricated using directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM), cracks may form due to interdendritic stress during solidification, the formation of intermetallics, or the buildup of residual stresses. This study builds on our previously proposed concept of three-alloy FGM system feasibility diagrams for the identification of gradient pathways that avoid deleterious phases in FGMs by also considering solidification cracking. Here, five solidification cracking criteria were integrated into the feasibility diagrams, and equilibrium simulations were carried out based on Scheil results (termed Scheil-equilibrium simulation) to predict phase formation below the solidus temperature considering solidification microsegregation. The new feasibility diagrams were applied to four previously studied FGM systems, and the newly proposed approach predicted high crack susceptibility, detrimental phase formation, or interdendritic BCC phase formation in the experimentally observed cracking region. This demonstrates the utility of the proposed framework for crack prediction in the design of future FGMs gradient pathways.",

    "abstract": "We take a critical lens toward the pursuit of racially inclusive language technologies and identify several areas necessitating future work. We discuss the potential harms of conversational technologies, outline three challenges that arise in inclusive design, and lastly, argue that conversational user interface designers and researchers should go beyond racially inclusive design toward anti-racist and race positive designs.",

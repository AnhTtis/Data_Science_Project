I wish to express my gratitude to my supervisor Jean-Luc Lehners, who has been a constant source of inspiration and a guidance during these years. I am grateful for sharing with me his view on science and cosmology, for all the blackboard discussions and for helping me become an independent scientist and thinker.\\
It was a pleasure to collaborate with extraordinary scientists such as Laura Sberna, Michal Heller, Sebastian Bramberger, Neil Turok and Job Feldbrugge.\\
I would like to especially thank Paolo Benincasa and Michal Heller for being my mentors in this last year of important decisions.\\
I would also like to thank Ana Alonso-Serrano, Teresa Bautista Solans and all the Soapbox Science Berlin team for showing me that empowerment comes from sharing experiences and knowledge and for the effort we do together to increase the visibility and recognition of the work of women* in science.\\
Anika Rast, Darya Niakhaichyk, Matthias Blittersdorf, Christina Pappa and Brit Holland are the people that make the AEI a warm and welcoming place to be.\\
I am thankful to the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) for their continued support, in particular to the director Hermann Nicolai and Axel Kleinschmidt and Hadi Godazgar, organizers of the IMPRS program.\\
This work has benefited from numerous discussions with the members of the theoretical cosmology group Caroline Jonas, Shane Farnsworth, Ana Alonso-Serrano, George Lavrelashvili, Jerome Quintin,  Enno Mallwitz and Marc Schneider.\\
I am especially grateful to my friend, office mate and collegue Sebastian Bramberger for the endless conversations about the universe, from the mathematics to the philosophy of it.\\
I would like to thank my friends, which all became experts in cosmology during this journey, especially Roukaya Dekhil which knew already all about the world and helped me understand so much.\\
I wish to end by thanking my family which supported me in every single step. This thesis is dedicated to Bianca e Francesco, because we do science to make the world a better place for the next generation.

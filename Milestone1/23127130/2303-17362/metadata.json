    "abstract": "We consider the inverse problem of determining, the possibly anisotropic, conductivity of a body by means of the so called local Neumann to Dirichlet map on a curved portion $Σ$ of the boundary. Motivated by the uniqueness result for piecewise constant anisotropic conductivities proved in \\cite{Al-dH-G}, we provide a Hölder stability estimate on $Σ$ when the conductivity is a priori known to be a constant matrix near $Σ$.",

    "abstract": "Considering the boundary layer problem in the case of two-dimensional flow past a wedge with the wedge angle $\\varphi=π\\frac{2m}{m+1}$, Oleinik and Samokhin obtained the local well-posedness results for $m \\geq 1$. In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to the Prandtl systems for arbitrary $m>0$, which solves the steady case in Open problem 6 proposed by Oleinik and Samokhin. Our proof is based on the maximum principle technique at the Crocco coordinates and the most important observation that when the fluid approaches a sharp point, it seems the self-similar solutions. Then we obtain the existence and uniqueness of the solution with the help of the self-similar solutions by the Line Method. Furthermore, we similarly establish the well-posedness results of three-dimensional flow past a cone.",

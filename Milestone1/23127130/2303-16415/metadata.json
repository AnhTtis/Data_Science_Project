    "abstract": "A radially heated Taylor-Couette setup is considered where an incompressible, Boussinesq fluid is sheared in the annular region between two concentric, independently rotating cylinders maintained at different temperatures. The radius ratios chosen for the current study are 0.6 and 0.9 corresponding to wide-gap and thin-gap cases. A linear stability analysis assuming infinite axial extent over a range of Grashof numbers with Taylor number as the control parameter is performed. The fastest growing modes at the onset of instability are found to be oscillatory for the parameters considered. Depending on the ratio of angular velocities and Grashof numbers, both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes are found to be the fastest growing modes. Compared to the case where the outer cylinder is held stationary, the rotation of the outer cylinder is shown to have a general stabilizing effect on the linear stability threshold, except for a few cases. Additionally, at a Grashof number of 1000, unstable modes are located even in the Rayleigh-stable regime for both wide-gap and thin-gap cases.",

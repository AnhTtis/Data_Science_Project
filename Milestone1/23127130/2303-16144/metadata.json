    "abstract": "We identify a route for the production of $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules in the $\\textrm{X} \\, ^1Σ^+$ rovibronic ground state that is compatible with efficient mixing of the atoms in optical lattices. We first construct a model for the excited-state structure using constants found by fitting to spectroscopy of the relevant $\\textrm{a} \\, ^3Σ^+ \\rightarrow \\textrm{b} \\, ^3Π_1$ transitions at 181.5 G and 217.1 G. We then compare the predicted transition dipole matrix elements from this model to those found for the transitions that have been successfully used for STIRAP at 181.5 G. We form molecules by magnetoassociation on a broad interspecies Feshbach resonance at 352.7 G and explore the pattern of Feshbach states near 305 G. This allows us to navigate to a suitable initial state for STIRAP by jumping across an avoided crossing with radiofrequency radiation. We identify suitable transitions for STIRAP at 305 G. We characterize these transitions experimentally and demonstrate STIRAP to a single hyperfine level of the ground state with a one-way efficiency of 85(4)%.",

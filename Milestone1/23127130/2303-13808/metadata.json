    "abstract": "Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) have led to many exciting applications. These advancements have been driven by improvements in both algorithms and engineering, which have resulted in faster training of RL agents. We present marl-jax, a multi-agent reinforcement learning software package for training and evaluating social generalization of the agents. The package is designed for training a population of agents in multi-agent environments and evaluating their ability to generalize to diverse background agents. It is built on top of DeepMind's JAX ecosystem~\\cite{deepmind2020jax} and leverages the RL ecosystem developed by DeepMind. Our framework marl-jax is capable of working in cooperative and competitive, simultaneous-acting environments with multiple agents. The package offers an intuitive and user-friendly command-line interface for training a population and evaluating its generalization capabilities. In conclusion, marl-jax provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in exploring social generalization in the context of MARL. The open-source code for marl-jax is available at: \\href{https://github.com/kinalmehta/marl-jax}{https://github.com/kinalmehta/marl-jax}",

    "abstract": "The theoretical investigation of relevant turbulent transport mechanisms in H-mode pedestals is a great scientific and numerical challenge. In this study, we address this challenge by global, nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of a full pedestal up to the separatrix, supported by a detailed characterisation of gyrokinetic instabilities from just inside the pedestal top to pedestal centre and foot. We present ASDEX Upgrade pedestal simulations using an upgraded version of the gyrokinetic, Eulerian, delta-f code GENE (genecode.org) that enables stable global simulations at experimental plasma beta values. The turbulent transport is found to exhibit a multi-channel, multi-scale character throughout the pedestal with the dominant contribution transitioning from ion scale Trapped Electron Modes (TEMs)/Micro Tearing Modes (MTMs) at the pedestal top to electron scale Electron Temperature Gradient modes (ETG) in the steep gradient region. Consequently, the turbulent electron heat flux changes from ion to electron scales and the ion heat flux reduces to almost neoclassic values in the pedestal centre. ExB shear is found to strongly reduce heat flux levels in all channels (electron, ion, electrostatic, electromagnetic) and the interplay of magnetic shear and pressure gradient is found to locally stabilise ion scale instabilities.",

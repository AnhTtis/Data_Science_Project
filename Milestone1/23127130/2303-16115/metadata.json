    "abstract": "We investigate an inverse boundary value problem of determination of a nonlinear law for reaction-diffusion processes, which are modeled by general form semilinear parabolic equations. We do not assume that any solutions to these equations are known a priori, in which case the problem has a well known gauge symmetry. We determine, under additional assumptions, the semilinear term up to this symmetry in a time-dependent anisotropic case modeled on Riemannian manifolds, and for partial data measurements on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Moreover, we present cases where it is possible to exploit the nonlinear interaction to break the gauge symmetry. This leads to full determination results of the nonlinear term. As an application, we show that it is possible to give a full resolution to classes of inverse source problems of determining a source term and nonlinear terms simultaneously. This is in strict contrast to inverse source problems for corresponding linear equations, which always have the gauge symmetry. We also consider a Carleman estimate with boundary terms based on intrinsic properties of parabolic equations.",

In this work we derived a computationally testable characterization of a non-degenerate alignment of possibly noisy local views (Theorem~\ref{thm:non_deg_loc_min}), followed by a necessary and sufficient condition for a non-degenerate alignment of two views (Theorem~\ref{thm:non_deg_two_views_gen_setting}). A similar condition for the uniqueness of an optimal alignment of two views is revisited (Theorem~\ref{thm:uniq_two_views_gen_setting}).

Thereafter, we worked in the noiseless setting, and under a mild assumption on the structure of the local views (which is satisfied when the views are affinely non-degenerate), we established equivalence of non-degeneracy and uniqueness of a perfect alignment with the local and global rigidity of the resulting perfect realization (Theorems~\ref{thm:loc_rigid} and \ref{thm:glob_rigid}). Then we derived certain necessary and sufficient conditions on the overlapping structure of the views for a locally rigid realization (equivalently a non-degenerate perfect alignment) (Theorems~\ref{thm:nec_cond_loc_rigid_of_views} and \ref{thm:G_star_1}). Similar conditions for a globally rigid realization (equivalently a unique perfect alignment) were also presented (Theorems~\ref{thm:nec_cond_glob_rigid_views} and \ref{thm:overline_G_star_1}).

As a simple application of the above results, we showed that RGD to solve the alignment problem in Eq.~(\ref{eq:GPOP}) converges linearly to a non-degenerate alignment when initialized close to it (Theorem~\ref{thm:rgd_conv}). Using sufficient conditions for non-degeneracy in the noiseless setting, we obtained corollaries connecting the overlapping structure of the views and the local rigidity of the realization with the convergence speed of RGD.

The following questions remain unanswered and we aim to address them in future work.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item A non-degenerate alignment can be characterized using both $\mathbf{L}(\mathbf{S})$ and $\mathbb{L}(\mathbf{S})$ (see Theorem~\ref{thm:non_deg_loc_min}). The physically-interpretable consequences of the algebraic structure of $\mathbf{L}(\mathbf{S})$ (see Remark~\ref{rmk:C_hat_L_structure}) are founded in the results that connect the overlapping structure of the views with the non-degeneracy of a perfect alignment (Section~\ref{subsec:non_deg_noiseless_setting}). Although, Remark~\ref{rmk:mathbb_L_structure} and \ref{rmk:mathbbL_examples} reveal the algebraic structure of $\mathbb{L}(\mathbf{S})$, the physical ramifications are still unclear.
    \item Analogous to those presented in Section~\ref{sec:noiseless_non_deg_results}, necessary and sufficient conditions in the general setting when the views are noisy, on the overlapping structure of $m > 2$ views for a non-degenerate alignment and for a unique optimal alignment are still unknown.
    \item Requiring an alignment to be non-degenerate for the local linear convergence of RGD to it, is in a sense a strong ask. The authors of \citea{liu2019quadratic} presented a much stronger result where they essentially showed the local linear convergence of RGD to any critical point (not necessarily non-degenerate) in a similar setting as ours. An extension of their result in Eq.~(\ref{eq:GPOP}) to our problem seems unclear. We aim to work on a geometric approach based on \citeb[Section 6.2]{usevich2020approximate}.

  Abstract                 = {In this article we study invariance properties of shift-invariant spaces in higher dimensions. We state and prove several necessary and sufficient conditions for a shift-invariant space to be invariant under a given closed subgroup of $${\mathbb {R}^d}$$, and prove the existence of shift-invariant spaces that are exactly invariant for each given subgroup. As an application we relate the extra invariance to the size of support of the Fourier transform of the generators of the shift-invariant space. This work extends recent results obtained for the case of one variable to several variables.},

Next we describe the construction of a CWT on the upper sheet of two-sheeted hyperboloid. Final ly we give some indications on the CWT on a paraboloid and we introduce a unified approach to the CWT on conic sections.},

  abstract  = {One of the most challenging areas in the field of automatic control is the design of automatic control devices that 'learn' to improve their performamce based upon experience, i.e., that can adapt themselves to circumstances as they find them. The military and commercial implications of such devices are impressive, and interest in the two main areas of research in the field of control, the USA and the USSR, runs high. Unfortunately, though, both theory and construction of adaptive controllers are in their infancy, and some time may pass before they are commonplace. Nonetheless, development at this time of adequate theories of processes of this nature is essential. The purpose of our paper is to show how the functional equation technique of a new mathematical discipline, dynamic programming, can be used in the formulation and solution of a variety of optimization problems concerning the design of adaptive devices. Although, occasionally, a solution in closed form can be obtained, in general, numerical solution via the use of high-speed digital computers is contemplated. We discuss here the closely allied problems of formulating adaptive control processes in precise mathematical terms and of presenting feasible computational algoritbms for determining numerical solutioms. To illustrate the general concepts, consider a system which is governed by the inhomogeneous Van der Pol equationddot{x} + mu(x^{2} - 1) dot{x} + x = r(t), 0 leq t leq T, wherer(t)is a random function whose statistical properties are only partially known to a feedback control device which seeks to keep the system near the unstable equilibrium statex = 0, dot{x} = 0. It proposes to do this by selecting the value of #956; as a function of the state of the system at timet, and the timetitself. By observing the random processr(t), the controller may, with the passage of time, infer more and more concerning the statistical properties of the functionr(t)and thus may be expected to improve the quality of its control decisions. In this way the controller adapts itself to circumstances as it finds them. The process is thus an interesting example of adaptive control, and, conceivably, with some immediate ap- plications. Lastly, some areas of this general domain requiring additional research are indicated.},

  Abstract                 = {This study analyses the effect of mobile phone transmission on vowel formant frequencies, based on the study presented by Kuenzel (2001). Six male and six female speakers read a short passage into a mobile phone. Two simultaneous recordings were made, one at the far end of the phone line and the other via a microphone directly in front of the speaker. Measurements of F1, F2 and F3 were taken from between 15 and 25 stressed vowels per speaker in both sets of recordings. Due to the filtering effect of the phone transmission, F1 frequencies for most vowels were found to be higher than their counterparts in the direct recordings. The overall effect of the mobile phone on F1 frequencies was considerably greater than the landline telephone effect found by Kuenzel (2001): on average the F1 values in the mobile condition were 29 per cent higher than in the direct condition. On the whole F2 measures were not significantly affected, in line with Kuenzels findings. F3 frequencies were also generally unaffected by the mobile phone transmission. Exceptions were found, however, particularly for individual speakers with relatively high F3s. In these cases the mobile recordings tended to yield significantly lower values. The consequences of measurement errors arising from the different recording conditions are discussed with reference to forensic speaker identification.|},

A set of frame generators for V is a set of functions whose integer translates form a frame for V. In this note we give necessary and sufficient conditions in order that a minimal set of frame generators can be obtained by taking linear combinations of the given frame generators. Surprisingly the results are very different from the recently studied case when the property to be a frame is not required.},

(Eds.), Curves and Surfaces, Vanderbilt University Press, Nashville, TN, 2000, pp. 105-120; Candès and Donoho available at http://www-stat.stanford.edu/donoho/Reports/1998/curvelets.zip, 1999). These systems combine ideas of multiscale analysis and geometry. Inspired by some recent work on digital Radon transforms (Averbuch et al. available at http://www-stat.stanford.edu/[small tilde]donoho/Reports/index.html), we then present very effective and accurate numerical implementations with computational complexities of at most N log N. In the second part of the paper, we propose to combine these new expansions with the Total Variation minimization principle for the reconstruction of an object whose curvelet coefficients are known only approximately: quantized, thresholded, noisy coefficients, etc. We set up a convex optimization problem and seek a reconstruction that has minimum Total Variation under the constraint that its coefficients do not exhibit a large discrepancy from the data available on the coefficients of the unknown object. We will present a series of numerical experiments which clearly demonstrate the remarkable potential of this new methodology for image compression, image reconstruction and image [`]de-noising'.},

  abstract  = {Abstract We discuss an elementary procedure that allows us to construct dual pairs of wavelet frames based on certain dual pairs of Gabor frames and vice versa. The construction preserves tightness of the involved frames. Starting with Gabor frames generated by characteristic functions the construction leads to a class of tight wavelet frames that include the Shannon (orthonormal) wavelet, and applying the construction to Gabor frames generated by certain exponential B-splines yields wavelet frames generated by functions whose Fourier transforms are compactly supported splines with geometrically distributed knot sequences. On the other hand, the pendant of the Meyer wavelet turns out to be a tight Gabor frame generated by a C a ( R ) function with compact support. As an application of our results we show that for each given pair of bandlimited dual wavelet frames it is possible to construct dual wavelet frames for any desired scaling and translation parameters.},

The use of a finite tight frame may lead to a simpler description of the symmetry transformations, to a simpler and more symmetric form of invariants or to the possibility of defining new mathematical objects with physical meaning, particularly in regard with the notion of a quantization of a finite set. We present some results concerning the use of integer coefficients and frame quantization, and several examples, and suggest some possible applications.},

In contrast to this, for every 2 < p < â??, d â?? â?? and unbounded sequence ($\lambda$ n ) nâ??â?? â?? â?? d we establish the existence of a function f â??

In particular, there exists a Schauder frame of integer translates for L p (â??) if (and only if) 2 < p < â??.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Nowadays the topic of sampling in a shift-invariant space is having a significant impact: it avoids most of the problems associated with classical Shannon's theory. Under appropriate hypotheses, any multivariate function in a shift-invariant space can be recovered from its samples at Z d . However, in many common situations the available data are samples of some convolution operators acting on the function itself: this leads to the problem of multivariate generalized sampling in shift-invariant spaces. This extra information on the functions in the shift-invariant space will allow to sample in an appropriate sub-lattice of Z d . In this paper an L 2 ( R d ) theory involving the frame theory is exhibited. Sampling formulas which are frame expansions for the shift-invariant space are obtained. In the case of overcomplete frame formulas, the search of reconstruction functions with prescribed good properties is allowed. Finally, approximation schemes using these generalized sampling formulas are included.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a vocoder, median-plane sound localization performance was measured in eight normal-hearing listeners as a function of the number of spectral channels. The channels were contiguous and logarithmically spaced in the range from 0.3 to 16 kHz. Acutely testing vocoded stimuli showed significantly worse localization compared to noises and 100 pulses click trains, both of which were tested after feedback training. However, localization for the vocoded stimuli was better than chance. A second experiment was performed using two different 12-channel spacings for the vocoded stimuli, now including feedback training. One spacing was from experiment 1. The second spacing (called the speech-localization spacing) assigned more channels to the frequency range associated with speech. There was no significant difference in localization between the two spacings. However, even with training, localizing 12-channel vocoded stimuli remained worse than localizing virtual wideband noises by 4.8 degrees in local root-mean-square error and 5.2% in quadrant error rate. Speech understanding for the speech-localization spacing was not significantly different from that for a typical spacing used by cochlear-implant users. These experiments suggest that current cochlear implants have a sufficient number of spectral channels for some vertical-plane sound localization capabilities, albeit worse than normal-hearing listeners, without loss of speech understanding.},

  abstract     = {{This article treats the problem of learning a dictionary providing sparse representations for a given signal class, via $\ell\_1$-minimisation. The problem can also be seen as factorising a $\ddim \times \nsig$ matrix $Y=(y\_1 >... y\_\nsig), y\_n\in \R^\ddim$ of training signals into a $\ddim \times \natoms$ dictionary matrix $\dico$ and a $\natoms \times \nsig$ coefficient matrix $\X=(x\_1... x\_\nsig), x\_n \in \R^\natoms$, which is sparse. The exact question studied here is when a dictionary coefficient pair $(\dico,\X)$ can be recovered as local minimum of a (nonconvex) $\ell\_1$-criterion with input $Y=\dico \X$. First, for general dictionaries and coefficient matrices, algebraic conditions ensuring local identifiability are derived, which are then specialised to the case when the dictionary is a basis. Finally, assuming a random Bernoulli-Gaussian sparse model on the coefficient matrix, it is shown that sufficiently incoherent bases are locally identifiable with high probability. The perhaps surprising result is that the typically sufficient number of training samples $\nsig$ grows up to a logarithmic factor only linearly with the signal dimension, i.e. $\nsig \approx C \natoms \log \natoms$, in contrast to previous approaches requiring combinatorially many samples.}},

This paper overviews the key features of both networks which give rise to these differences. Some findings are then presented showing the impact of the mobile network on fundamental frequency, F0, as well as on the first three formants in vowel sounds. It is shown that though the impact on F0 is not great, the impact on the formant frequencies, and particularly on the measurements of these determined using automated formant trackers, can be significant. These early findings are considered to be of great importance to forensic practitioners relying on acoustic measurements as part of their investigations.},

  Abstract                 = {A time-varying, analysis/synthesis auditory filterbank has been developed using a new implementation of the ldquo;gammachirp rdquo;, which has been shown to be an excellent function for the asymmetric, level-dependent auditory filter. The gammachirp filter is shown to be implemented through a combination of a gammatone filter and an IIR asymmetric compensation filter; which largely reduces the computational cost for time-varying filtering. The gammachirp filterbank is designed using a linear gammatone filterbank and a bank of time-varying asymmetric compensation filters controlled by the sound pressure level estimated at the output of the filterbank. Since the inverse filter of the asymmetric compensation filter is always stable, it is possible to resynthesize signals from time-varying, level-dependent auditory representations. The resynthesis error is only determined by the linear analysis/synthesis gammatone filterbank. The proposed filterbank is applicable to various types of signal processing required to model human auditory filtering},

  Abstract                 = {Speech scientists often have to work with speech signals that have been transmitted over the telephone. Although the acoustic properties of telephone transmission such as the band-pass filter characteristics are well known, little attention has been paid to their effect on the measurement of speech parameters. This study deals with artefacts introduced by the lower cut-off slope of the transmission channel on vowel formants. For theoretical reasons, frequency components may be assumed to be attenuated the lower they are. Therefore F1 of most vowels can be expected to be affected most. Attenuation of the lower components of a formant will necessarily increase the relative weight of the higher components for the determination of a formant and thus cause an artificial upward shift of its centre frequency. An empirical investigation with directly and telephone-transmitted samples from ten male and ten female subjects shows that the predicted effect on F1 does in fact occur for all tested vowels except /a/, whose F1 is too high to be affected by the slope of the band-pass. The consequences of measurement errors arising from such artefacts are discussed with special reference to speaker identification and empirical dialectology.},

  Abstract                 = {A new binary mask is introduced for improving speech intelligibility based on magnitude spectrum constraints. The proposed binary mask is designed to retain time-frequency (T-F) units of the mixture signal satisfying a magnitude constraint while discarding T-F units violating the constraint. Motivated by prior intelligibility studies of speech synthesized using the ideal binary mask, an algorithm is proposed that decomposes the input signal into T-F units and makes binary decisions, based on a Bayesian classifier, as to whether each T-F unit satisfies the magnitude constraint or not. Speech corrupted at low signal-to-noise (SNR) levels (-5 and 0 dB) using different types of maskers is synthesized by this algorithm and presented to normal-hearing listeners for identification. Results indicated substantial improvements in intelligibility over that attained by human listeners with unprocessed stimuli.},

  abstract  = {It is well known that Gabor expansions generated by a lattice of Nyquist density are numerically unstable, in the sense that they do not constitute frame decompositions. In this paper, we clarify exactly how bad such Gabor expansions are, we make it clear precisely where the edge is between enough and too little, and we find a remedy for their shortcomings in terms of a certain summability method. This is done through an investigation of somewhat more general sequences of points in the time-frequency plane than lattices (all of Nyquist density), which in a sense yields information about the uncertainty principle on a finer scale than allowed by traditional density considerations. An important role is played by certain Hilbert scales of function spaces, most notably by what we call the Schwartz scale and the Bargmann scale, and the intrinsically interesting fact that the Bargmann transform provides a bounded invertible mapping between these two scales. This permits us to turn the problems into interpolation problems in spaces of entire functions, which we are able to treat.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to localize sound sources in three-dimensional space was tested in humans. In Experiment 1, naive subjects listened to noises filtered with subject-specific head-related transfer functions. The tested conditions included the pointing method (head or manual pointing) and the visual environment (VE; darkness or virtual VE). The localization performance was not significantly different between the pointing methods. The virtual VE significantly improved the horizontal precision and reduced the number of front-back confusions. These results show the benefit of using a virtual VE in sound localization tasks. In Experiment 2, subjects were provided with sound localization training. Over the course of training, the performance improved for all subjects, with the largest improvements occurring during the first 400 trials. The improvements beyond the first 400 trials were smaller. After the training, there was still no significant effect of pointing method, showing that the choice of either head- or manual-pointing method plays a minor role in sound localization performance. The results of Experiment 2 reinforce the importance of perceptual training for at least 400 trials in sound localization studies.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we consider the problem of separation of unknown number of sources from their underdetermined convolutive mixtures via time-frequency (TF) masking. We propose two algorithms, one for the estimation of the masks which are to be applied to the mixture in the TF domain for the separation of signals in the frequency domain, and the other for solving the permutation problem. The algorithm for mask estimation is based on the concept of angles in complex vector space. Unlike the previously reported methods, the algorithm does not require any estimation of the mixing matrix or the source positions for mask estimation. The algorithm clusters the mixture samples in the TF domain based on the Hermitian angle between the sample vector and a reference vector using the well known k -means or fuzzy c -means clustering algorithms. The membership functions so obtained from the clustering algorithms are directly used as the masks. The algorithm for solving the permutation problem clusters the estimated masks by using k-means clustering of small groups of nearby masks with overlap. The effectiveness of the algorithm in separating the sources, including collinear sources, from their underdetermined convolutive mixtures obtained in a real room environment, is demonstrated.},

In this paper we describe the major elements of MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based speaker verification system used successfully in several NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluations (SREs). The system is built around the likelihood ratio test for verification, using simple but effective GMMs for likelihood functions, a universal background model (UBM) for alternative speaker representation, and a form of Bayesian adaptation to derive speaker models from the UBM. The development and use of a handset detector and score normalization to greatly improve verification performance is also described and discussed. Finally, representative performance benchmarks and system behavior experiments on NIST SRE corpora are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {We present in this paper new multiscale transforms on the sphere, namely the isotropic undecimated wavelet transform, the pyramidal wavelet transform, the ridgelet transform and the curvelet transform. All of these transforms can be inverted i.e. we can exactly reconstruct the original data from its coefficients in either representation. Several applications are described. We show how these transforms can be used in denoising and especially in a Combined Filtering Method, which uses both the wavelet and the curvelet transforms, thus benefiting from the advantages of both transforms. An application to component separation from multichannel data mapped to the sphere is also described in which we take advantage of moving to a wavelet representation.},

  Abstract                 = {Multipliers are operators that combine (frame-like) analysis, a multiplication with a fixed sequence, called the symbol, and synthesis. They are very interesting mathematical objects that also have a lot of applications for example in acoustical signal processing. It is known that bounded symbols and Bessel sequences guarantee unconditional convergence. In this paper we investigate necessary and equivalent conditions for the unconditional convergence of multipliers. In particular, we show that, under mild conditions, unconditionally convergent multipliers can be transformed by shifting weights between symbol and sequence, into multipliers with symbol (1) and Bessel sequences (called multipliers in canonical form).},

G-frames are natural generalizations of frames and provide more choices on analyzing functions from frame expansion coefficients. We give characterizations of g-frames and prove that g-frames share many useful properties with frames. We also give a generalized version of Riesz bases and orthonormal bases. As an application, we get atomic resolutions for bounded linear operators.},

  Abstract                 = {This document describes SILK, a speech codec for real-time, packet-based voice communications. Targeting a diverse range of operating environments, SILK provides scalability in several dimensions. Four different sampling frequencies are supported for encoding the audio input signal. Adaptation to network characteristics is provided through control of bitrate, packet rate, packet loss resilience and use of discontinuous transmission (DTX). And several different complexity levels let SILK take advantage of available processing power without relying on it. Each of these properties can be adjusted during operation of the codec on a frame-by-frame basis.},

  Abstract                 = {So-called short-time Fourier transform multipliers (also called Anti-Wick operators in the literature) arise by applying a pointwise multiplication operator to the STFT before applying the inverse STFT. Boundedness results are investigated for such operators on modulation spaces and on L p -spaces. Because the proofs apply naturally to Wiener amalgam spaces the results are formulated in this context. Furthermore, a version of the Hardy-Littlewood inequality for the STFT is derived.},

  abstract  = {We propose a novel method to identify an unknown linear time invariant (LTI) system in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. The method is based on transmitting chirp signals for the transmitter and using linear time-variant filters in the joint time-frequency (TF) domain for the receiver to reduce noise before identification. Due to the TF localization property of chirp signals, a large amount of additive white noise can be reduced, and therefore, the SNR before identification can be significantly increased. This, however, cannot be achieved in the conventional methods, where pseudo-random signals are used, and therefore, noise reduction techniques do not apply. Our simulation results indicate that the method proposed outperforms the conventional methods significantly in a low SNR environment. This paper provides a good application of time-frequency analysis and synthesis},

Then we study the properties of g-Riesz bases and g-orthonormal bases in Hilbert spaces. Especially we establish certain uniqueness on the dual g-frames of them. By using the disjoint g-frames as tools, we show that g-frame has a unique dual g-frame if and only if it is a g-Riesz basis. We also show that a normalized tight g-frame has a unique normalized tight dual g-frame, i.e., itself.},

  abstract = {The blind source separation problem is to extract the underlying source signals from a set of linear mixtures, where the mixing matrix is unknown. This situation is common in acoustics, radio, medical signal and image processing, hyperspectral imaging, and other areas. We suggest a two-stage separation process: a priori selection of a possibly overcomplete signal dictionary (for instance, a wavelet frame or a learned dictionary) in which the sources are assumed to be sparsely representable, followed by unmixing the sources by exploiting the their sparse representability. We consider the general case of more sources than mixtures, but also derive a more efficient algorithm in the case of a nonovercomplete dictionary and an equal numbers of sources and mixtures. Experiments with artificial signals and musical sounds demonstrate significantly better separation than other known techniques.},

However, practical constraints often force us to apply sequences that do not exactly form dual frames. In this article, we consider the important case of generalized shift-invariant systems and provide various ways of estimating the deviation from perfect reconstruction that occur when the systems do not form dual frames. The deviation from being dual frames will be measured either in terms of a perturbation condition or in terms of the deviation from equality in the duality conditions.},

  abstract = {The separation of an underdetermined audio mixture can be performed through sparse component analysis (SCA) that relies however on the strong hypothesis that source signals are sparse in some domain. To overcome this difficulty in the case where the original sources are available before the mixing process, the informed source separation (ISS) embeds in the mixture a watermark, which information can help a further separation. Though powerful, this technique is generally specific to a particular mixing setup and may be compromised by an additional bitrate compression stage. Thus, instead of watermarking, we propose a `doping' method that makes the time-frequency representation of each source more sparse, while preserving its audio quality. This method is based on an iterative decrease of the distance between the distribution of the signal and a target sparse distribution, under a perceptual constraint. We aim to show that the proposed approach is robust to audio coding and that the use of the sparsified signals improves the source separation, in comparison with the original sources. In this work, the analysis is made only in instantaneous mixtures and focused on voice sources.},

  abstract = {Sparse signal expansions represent or approximate a signal using a small number of elements from a large collection of elementary waveforms. Finding the optimal sparse expansion is known to be NP hard in general and non-optimal strategies such as Matching Pursuit, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, Basis Pursuit and Basis Pursuit De-noising are often called upon. These methods show good performance in practical situations, however, they do not operate on the ?                        0 penalised cost functions that are often at the heart of the problem. In this paper we study two iterative algorithms that are minimising the cost functions of interest. Furthermore, each iteration of these strategies has computational complexity similar to a Matching Pursuit iteration, making the methods applicable to many real world problems. However, the optimisation problem is non-convex and the strategies are only guaranteed to find local solutions, so good initialisation becomes paramount. We here study two approaches. The first approach uses the proposed algorithms to refine the solutions found with other methods, replacing the typically used conjugate gradient solver. The second strategy adapts the algorithms and we show on one example that this adaptation can be used to achieve results that lie between those obtained with Matching Pursuit and those found with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, while retaining the computational complexity of the Matching Pursuit algorithm.},

  abstract = {This work develops a quantitative framework for describing the overcompleteness of a large class of frames. A previous article introduced notions of localization and approximation between two frames F = {\{}fi{\}}i?I and E = {\{}ej{\}}j?G (G a discrete abelian group), relating the decay of the expansion of the elements of F in terms of the elements of E via a map a : I {\textrightarrow} G. This article shows that those abstract results yield an array of new implications for irregular Gabor frames. Additionally, various Nyquist density results for Gabor frames are recovered as special cases, and in the process both their meaning and implications are clarified. New results are obtained on the excess and overcompleteness of Gabor frames, on the relationship between frame bounds and density, and on the structure of the dual frame of an irregular Gabor frame. More generally, these results apply both to Gabor frames and to systems of Gabor molecules, whose elements share only a common envelope of concentration in the time-frequency plane. The notions of localization and related approximation properties are a spectrum of ideas that quantify the degree to which elements of one frame can be approximated by elements of another frame. In this article, a comprehensive examination of the interrelations among these localization and approximation concepts is made, with most implications shown to be sharp.},

  abstract = {Redundancy is the qualitative property which makes Hilbert space frames so useful in practice. However, developing a meaningful quantitative notion of redundancy for infinite frames has proven elusive. Though quantitative candidates for redundancy exist, the main open problem is whether a frame with redundancy greater than one contains a subframe with redundancy arbitrarily close to one. We will answer this question in the affirmative for ?                        1-localized frames. We then specialize our results to Gabor multi-frames with generators in M                        1(R                                          d                ), and Gabor molecules with envelopes in W(C, l                        1). As a main tool in this work, we show there is a universal function g(x) so that, for every $\epsilon$ =s> 0, every Parseval frame {\{}f                                          i                {\}}                                                i=1                                      M                                   for an N-dimensional Hilbert space H                                          N                 has a subset of fewer than (1+$\epsilon$)N elements which is a frame for H                                          N                 with lower frame bound g($\epsilon$/(2M/N ? 1)). This work provides the first meaningful quantative notion of redundancy for a large class of infinite frames. In addition, the results give compelling new evidence in support of a general definition of redundancy given in [5].},

  abstract     = {In recent years, it has been shown that many modern iterative algorithms  (multigrid schemes, multilevel preconditioners, domain decomposition   methods etc.)  for solving problems resulting from the discretization  of PDEs can be  interpreted as additive (Jacobi-like) or multiplicative  (Gauss-Seidel-like) subspace correction methods. The key to their  analysis is the study of certain metric properties of the underlying  splitting of the discretization space                   {\$}V{\$}                 into a sum of subspaces                   {\$}V{\_}j{\$}                  and the splitting of the variational problem on                   {\$}V{\$}                 into auxiliary problems on  these subspaces.In this paper, we propose a modification of the abstract convergence  theory of the additive and multiplicative Schwarz methods, that  makes the relation to traditional iteration methods more explicit.  The analysis of the additive and multiplicative Schwarz iterations  can be carried out in almost the same spirit as in the  traditional block-matrix  situation, making convergence proofs of multilevel and domain decomposition  methods clearer, or, at least, more classical.  In addition, we present a  new bound for the convergence rate of the appropriately scaled  multiplicative Schwarz method directly in terms  of the condition number of the corresponding additive  Schwarz operator.  These results may be viewed as an appendix to the  recent surveys [X], [Ys].},

  abstract = {Among topics related to the evolution of language, the evolution of speech is particularly fascinating. Early theorists believed that it was the ability to produce articulate speech that set the stage for the evolution of the «special» speech processing abilities that exist in modern-day humans. Prior to the evolution of speech production, speech processing abilities were presumed not to exist. The data reviewed here support a different view. Two lines of evidence, one from young human infants and the other from infrahuman species, neither of whom can produce articulate speech, show that in the absence of speech production capabilities, the perception of speech sounds is robust and sophisticated. Human infants and non-human animals evidence auditory perceptual categories that conform to those defined by the phonetic categories of language. These findings suggest the possibility that in evolutionary history the ability to perceive rudimentary speech categories preceded the ability to produce articulate speech. This in turn suggests that it may be audition that structured, at least initially, the formation of phonetic categories.},

This assumption allows to cover a wide range of problems, including nonsmooth semi-algebraic (or more generally tame) minimization. The specialization of our result to different kinds of structured problems provides several new convergence results for inexact versions of the gradient method, the proximal method, the forward--backward splitting algorithm, the gradient projection and some proximal regularization of the Gauss--Seidel method in a nonconvex setting. Our results are illustrated through feasibility problems, or iterative thresholding procedures for compressive sensing.},

Additionally, a novel approach to the recombination of the Gammatone filterbank output is introduced that allows for the resynthesis of the signal with a total time delay of 4 ms. The signal reconstruction is nearly perfect, i.e., the difference between input and reconstructed output is barely audible. A detailed technical description of the analysis-synthesis system is given and an implementation using the Matlab programming environment is introduced, which is available online. A possible application of the analysis/synthesis system introduced here is speech processing for hearing aids.},

Our approach allows to analyze various classes of nonconvex-nonsmooth problems and related nonconvex proximal forward--backward algorithms with semi-algebraic problem's data, the later property being shared by many functions arising in a wide variety of fundamental applications. A by-product of our framework also shows that our results are new even in the convex setting.

These papers meant a break-through in the field, because their adaptive methods were not only proven to converge, but also with a rate better than that of their non-adaptive counterparts in cases where the latter methods converge with a reduced rate due a lacking regularity of the solution. Until then, adaptive methods were usually assumed to converge via a saturation assumption. An exception was given by the work of D{\"o}rfler in [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 33 (1996), 1106--1124], where an adaptive finite element method was proven to converge, with no rate though.},

A fusion frame (frame of subspaces) is a frame-like collection of subspaces in a Hilbert space, thereby constructing a frame for the whole space by joining sequences of frames for subspaces. Moreover the notion of fusion frames provide a framework for applications and providing efficient and robust information processing algorithms. In this paper we study the conditions under which removing an element from a fusion frame, again we obtain another fusion frame. We give another proof of [5, Corollary 3.3(iii)] with extra information about the bounds.},

In this paper, we investigate the cross-Gram operator G, associated to the sequence {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{}{\backslash}langle f{\_}{\{}k{\}}, g{\_}{\{}j{\}}{\backslash}rangle {\backslash}{\}}{\_}{\{}j, k=1{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}infty {\}}{\$}{\$}{\{}?fk,gj?{\}}j,k=1?and sufficient and necessary conditions for boundedness, invertibility, compactness and positivity of this operator are determined depending on the associated sequences. We show that invertibility of G is not possible when the associated sequences are frames but not Riesz Bases or at most one of them is Riesz basis. In the special case, we prove that G is a positive operator when {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{}g{\_}{\{}k{\}}{\backslash}{\}}{\_}{\{}k=1{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}infty {\}}{\$}{\$}{\{}gk{\}}k=1?is the canonical dual of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{}f{\_}{\{}k{\}}{\backslash}{\}}{\_}{\{}k=1{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}infty {\}}{\$}{\$}{\{}fk{\}}k=1?.},

We also study weaving Schauder bases, where it is necessary to introduce two notions of weaving. On one hand, we can ask if two Schauder bases are woven when considered as Schauder frames with their biorthogonal functionals, and alternatively, we can ask if each weaving of two Schauder bases remains a Schauder basis. We will prove that these two notions coincide when all weavings are unconditional, but otherwise they can be different. Lastly, we prove two perturbation theorems for approximate Schauder frames.},

To date, the best known RIP matrices are constructed using random processes, while explicit constructions are notorious for performing at the ``square-root bottleneck,'' i.e., they only accept sparsity levels on the order of the square root of the number of measurements. The only known explicit matrix which surpasses this bottleneck was constructed by Bourgain, Dilworth, Ford, Konyagin, and Kutzarova in Bourgain et al. (Duke Math. J. 159:145--185, 2011). This chapter provides three contributions to advance the groundbreaking work of Bourgain et al.: (i) we develop an intuition for their matrix construction and underlying proof techniques; (ii) we prove a generalized version of their main result; and (iii) we apply this more general result to maximize the extent to which their matrix construction surpasses the square-root bottleneck.},

  abstract = {The construction of equal-norm Parseval frames is fundamental for many applications of frame theory. We present a construction method based on a system of ordinary differential equations, which generates a flow on the set of Parseval frames that converges to equal-norm Parseval frames. We developed this method to address a question posed by Vern Paulsen: How close is a nearly equal-norm, nearly Parseval frame to an equal-norm Parseval frame? The distance estimate derived here can be used to substantiate numerically found, approximate constructions of equal-norm Parseval frames. The estimate is valid for a fairly general class of frames  requiring that the dimension of the Hilbert space and the number of frame vectors is relatively prime. In addition, we re-phrase our distance estimate to show that certain projection matrices which are nearly constant on the diagonal are close in HilbertSchmidt norm to ones which have a constant diagonal.},

  abstract = {We consider the question whether, given a countable family of lattices (?j)j?J in a locally compact abelian group G, there exist functions (gj)j?J such that the resulting generalized shift-invariant system (gj(???))j?J,???j is a tight frame of L2(G). This paper develops a new approach to the study of generalized shift-invariant system via almost periodic functions, based on a novel unconditional convergence property. From this theory, we derive characterizing relations for tight and dual frame generators, we introduce the system bandwidth as a measure of the total bandwidth a generalized shift-invariant system can carry, and we show that the so-called Calderón sum is uniformly bounded from below for generalized shift-invariant frames. Without the unconditional convergence property, we show, counter intuitively, that even orthonormal bases can have arbitrary small system bandwidth. Our results show that the question of existence of frame generators for a general lattice system is rather subtle and depends on analytical and algebraic properties of the lattice system.},

Our discussion is restricted to families of uniform tight frames obtained from sampling along a path in a given d-dimensional Hilbert space. We prove upper and lower bounds for the maximal Euclidean reconstruction error in terms of geometric quantities for the path. While the upper bounds are independent of the particular quantizer used, the lower bounds require quantizers that assume only integer multiples of a step-size ? (mid-tread). We calculate these bounds for various known frame families obtained from sampling and introduce new such paths, the so-called d-circles and semicircles frames. The latter give a slight improvement in the upper bound over the harmonic frames. The bounds we derive for N frame vectors in dimension d and quantization step-size ? are of the order ?d3/2/N, with numerical constants that are comparable to that of coordinatewise application of the sigmadelta algorithm.},

  abstract = {A neural network learning paradigm based on information theory is proposed as a way to perform, in an unsupervised fashion, redundancy reduction among the elements of the output layer without loss of information from the sensory input. The model developed performs nonlinear decorrelation up to higher orders of the cumulant tensors and results in probabilistically independent components of the output layer. This means that we don't need to assume Gaussian distribution at either the input or the output. The theory presented is related to the unsupervised learning theory of Barlow, which proposes redundancy reduction as the goal of cognition. When nonlinear units are used (sigmoid or higher-order pi-neurons), nonlinear principal component analysis is obtained. In this case, nonlinear manifolds can be reduced to minimum dimension manifolds. If such units are used the network performs a generalized principal component analysis in the sense that non-Gaussian distributions can be linearly decorrelated and higher orders of the correlation tensors are also taken into account. The basic structure of the architecture involves a general transformation that is volume conserving and therefore the entropy, yielding a map without loss of information. Minimization of the mutual information among the output neurons eliminates the redundancy between the outputs and results in statistical decorrelation of the extracted features. This is known as factorial learning. To sum up, this paper presents a model of factorial learning for general nonlinear transformations of an arbitrary non-Gaussian (or Gaussian) environment with statistically nonlinearly correlated input. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.},

The associated operators correspond to classical frame operators or weakly-defined multipliers in the bounded context. In general some properties of them, such as the invertibility and the resolvent set, are related to properties of the sesquilinear forms.

In applications like sparse signal processing, data transmission with robustness to erasures, and reconstruction without phase, there is a pressing need for deterministic constructions of frames with the following property: every size-M subcollection of the M-dimensional frame elements is a spanning set. Such frames are called full spark frames, and this paper provides new constructions using the discrete Fourier transform. Later, we prove that full spark Parseval frames are dense in the entire set of Parseval frames, meaning full spark frames are abundant, even if one imposes an additional tightness constraint. Finally, we prove that testing whether a given matrix is full spark is hard for NP under randomized polynomial-time reductions, indicating that deterministic full spark constructions are particularly significant because they guarantee a property which is otherwise difficult to check.},

  abstract  = {The present paper aims at reviewing the research on the wavelet-based rapid solution of boundary integral equations. When discretizing boundary integral equations by appropriate wavelet bases the system matrices are quasi-sparse. Discarding the non-relevant matrix entries is called wavelet matrix compression. The compressed system matrix can be assembled within linear complexity if an exponentially convergent hp-quadrature algorithm is used. Therefore, in combination with wavelet preconditioning, one arrives at an algorithm that solves a given boundary integral equation within discretization error accuracy, offered by the underlying Galerkin method, at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of unknowns. By numerical results we illustrate and quantify the theoretical findings.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent progress in dynamical sampling we prove that every frame which is norm-bounded below can be represented as a finite union of sequences {(Tj)n?j}n=0?,j=1,,J for some bounded operators Tj and elements ?j in the underlying Hilbert space. The result is optimal, in the sense that it turns out to be problematic to replace the collection of generators ?1,,?J by a singleton: indeed, for linearly independent frames we prove that we can represent the frame in terms of just one system {Tn?}n=0?, but unfortunately this representation often forces the operator T to be unbounded. Several examples illustrate the connection of the results to typical frames like Gabor frames and wavelet frames, as well as generic constructions in arbitrary separable Hilbert spaces.},

abstract = "It is known that the algebra of Schur operators on ?2 (namely operators bounded on both ?1 and ??) is not inverse-closed. When ?2=?2(X) where X is a metric space, one can consider elements of the Schur algebra with certain decay at infinity. For instance if X has the doubling property, then Q. Sun has proved that the weighted Schur algebra A?(X) for a strictly polynomial weight ? is inverse-closed. In this paper, we prove a sharp result on left-invertibility of the these operators. Namely, if an operator A?A?(X) satisfies ?Af?p??f?p, for some 1?p??, then it admits a left-inverse in A?(X). The main difficulty here is to obtain the above inequality in ?2. The author was both motivated and inspired by a previous work of Aldroubi, Baskarov and Krishtal (2008) [1], where similar results were obtained through different methods for X=Zd, under additional conditions on the decay."

These two theorems, which deliver the desired results usually very quickly and comfortably, are missing or wrongly cited in many recent publications on the topic, The paper is intended as a gentle guide to the field. The basic theorems are precisely stated, some of them are accompanied by full proofs, others not, but precise references are given in each case, and many examples illustrate how to work with the theorems."

The aim is to implement acoustic scene classification of audio recordings into 10 predefined classes including Airport, shopping mall, metro station, street pedestrian, public square, street traffic, tram, bus, metro, and park. Two main drawbacks of this task are that recordings are provided by five devices with different quality and that some of these classes are very close in terms of acoustic information. To bias correct all instruments against the reference (here the instrument A), we have used XGboost algorithm fed by standaridiezd Mel spectrogram. Our classifier consists of a CNN, mix-up augmentation, and snapshot ensemble (to decrease the total number of parameters and, consequently, the variance of model prediction). Our model has yielded an accuracy of 62.1\% and cross-entropy loss of 1.06. Whereas the baseline model has yielded the accuracy and cross-entropy loss of 54.1\% and 1.36, respectively."

abstract="The dominant paradigm for video-based action segmentation is composed of two steps: first, compute low-level features for each frame using Dense Trajectories or a Convolutional Neural Network to encode local spatiotemporal information, and second, input these features into a classifier such as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that captures high-level temporal relationships. While often effective, this decoupling requires specifying two separate models, each with their own complexities, and prevents capturing more nuanced long-range spatiotemporal relationships. We propose a unified approach, as demonstrated by our Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), that hierarchically captures relationships at low-, intermediate-, and high-level time-scales. Our model achieves superior or competitive performance using video or sensor data on three public action segmentation datasets and can be trained in a fraction of the time it takes to train an RNN.",

abstract = "This survey article is concerned with two basic approximation concepts and their interrelation with the numerical solution of elliptic operator equations, namely nonlinear and adaptive approximation. On one hand, for nonlinear approximation based on wavelet expansions, the best possible approximation rate which a function can have for a given number of degrees of freedom is characterized in terms of its regularity in a certain scale of Besov spaces. Therefore, after demonstrating the gain of nonlinear approximation over linear approximation measured in a Sobolev scale, we review some recent results on the Sobolev and Besov regularity of solutions to elliptic boundary value problems. On the other hand, nonlinear approximation requires information that is generally not available in practice. Instead one has to resort to the concept of adaptive approximation. We briefly summarize some recent results on wavelet based adaptive schemes for elliptic operator equations. In contrast to more conventional approaches one can show that these schemes converge without prior assumptions on the solution, such as the saturation property. One central objective of this paper is to contribute to interrelating nonlinear approximation and adaptive methods in the context of elliptic operator equations."

In this paper, we review the basic properties of proximity operators which are relevant to signal processing and present optimization methods based on these operators.

  abstract = {Classification is a fundamental image processing task. Recent empirical evidence suggests that classification algorithms which make use of redundant linear transforms will regularly outperform their nonredundant counterparts. We provide a rigorous explanation of this phenomenon in the single-class case. We begin by developing a measure-theoretic analysis of the set of points at which a given decision rule will have an intolerable chance of making a classification error. We then apply this general theory to the special case where the class is compact and convex, showing that such a class may be arbitrarily well approximated by frame sets, namely, preimages of hyperrectangles under frame analysis operators. This leads to a frame-based classification scheme in which frame coefficients are regarded as features. We show that, indeed, the accuracy of such a classification scheme approaches perfect accuracy as the redundancy of the frame grows large.},

The present article proves that their mapping is indeed a proximal operator, and also derives its proper counterpart. Furthermore, it is rationalized that Lieb and Stark?s operator can be understood as an approximation of the proper mapping.

    abstract = {Males in a wide variety of taxa, including insects, birds and mammals, produce vocalizations to attract females. Male house mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), especially during courtship and mating, which are surprising complex. It is often suggested that male mice vocalize at higher rates after interacting with a female, but the evidence is mixed depending upon the strain of mice. We conducted a study with wild-derived house mice (Mus musculus musculus) to test whether male courtship vocalizations (i.e., vocalizations emitted in a sexual context) are influenced by a prior direct interaction with a female, and if so, determine how long the effect lasts. We allowed sexually naïve males to directly interact with a female for five minutes (sexual priming), and then we recorded malesvocalizations either 1, 10, 20, or 30 days later when presented with an unfamiliar female (separated by a perforated partition) and female scent. We automatically detected USVs and processed recordings using the Automatic Mouse Ultrasound Detector (A-MUD version 3.2), and we describe our improved version of this tool and tests of its performance. We measured vocalization rate and spectro-temporal features and we manually classified USVs into 15 types to investigate priming effects on vocal repertoire diversity and composition. After sexual priming, males emitted nearly three times as many USVs, they had a larger repertoire diversity, and their vocalizations had different spectro-temporal features (USV length, slope and variability in USV frequency) compared to unprimed controls. Unprimed control males had the most distinctive repertoire composition compared to the primed groups. Most of the effects were found when comparing unprimed to all primed males (treatment models), irrespective of the time since priming. Timepoint models showed that USV length increased 1 day after priming, that repertoire diversity increased 1 and 20 days after priming, and that the variability of USV frequencies was lower 20 and 30 days after priming. Our results show that wild-derived male mice increased the number and diversity of courtship vocalizations if they previously interacted with a female. Thus, the USVs of house mice are not only context-dependent, they depend upon previous social experience and perhaps the contexts of these experiences. The effect of sexual priming on male courtship vocalizations is likely mediated by neuro-endocrine-mechanisms, which may function to advertise males sexual arousal and facilitate social recognition.},

abstract = "This paper demonstrates that optimum weighting coefficients and inverse filters for microphone arrays can be accomplished, with the aid of a systematic methodology of mathematical programming. Both far-field and near-field array problems are formulated in terms of convex optimization formalism. Three application examples, including data-independent far-field array design, nearfield array design, and pressure field interpolation, are presented. In far-field array design, array coefficients are optimized to tradeoff Directivity Index for White Noise Gain or the coefficient norm, while in nearfield array convex optimization is applied to design Equivalent Source Method-based Nearfield Acoustical Holography. Numerical examples are given for designing a far-field two-dimensional random array comprised of thirty microphones. For far-field arrays, five design approaches, including a Delay-And-Sum beamformer, a Super Directivity Array, three optimal arrays designed using ?1,?2,and??-norms, are compared. Numerical and experimental results have shown that sufficiently high White Noise Gain was crucial to robust performance of array against sensor mismatch and noise. For nearfield arrays, inverse filters were designed in light of Equivalent Source Method and convex optimization to reconstruct the velocity field on a baffled spherical piston source. The proposed nearfield design is benchmarked by those designed using Truncated Singular Value Decomposition and Tikhonov Regularization. Compressive Sampling and convex optimization is applied to pressure field reconstruction, source separation and modal analysis with satisfactory performance in both near-field and far-field microphone arrays."

abstract = "Acoustic imaging is an important technique for sound source identification which is widely used in noise control and fault detection. It can be described as a method for reconstructing the amplitude and phase distribution of an acoustic field in a given plane. When the size of radiating object is huge and measurement environment is noisy, accuracy and efficiency of acoustic imaging algorithm deteriorate easily. In this paper, a novel computational framework is investigated to simplify the algorithm and balance computation speed with accuracy. It converts acoustic imaging into an inverse problem and then divides this problem into two parts including forward model and denoising model. This computation framework is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, which makes parallel implementation and distributed optimization possible, especially for large scale measurements. It is assumed that the acoustic field is composed of a cluster of monopole sources and the equivalent source method is taken to solve the acoustic inverse problem. Both L2-norm penalization based on the minimal energy assumption and Lp-norm (0<p?1) penalization based on the sparsity hypothesis are taken in this framework. Thus, the regularization parameter in the algorithm, which balances the standard least square error and the norm of the source solution, can be coupled with some pre-existing methods incluing L-curve, GCV and Bayesian strategies. Different regularization parameters are proposed and the comparison is made in this paper. The proposed method provides a general and convenient method for different type of sound source priors and it is validated with an experiment."

abstract = "We consider stability and uniqueness in real phase retrieval problems over general input sets, when the data consists of random and noisy quadratic measurements of an unknown input x0?Rn that lies in a general set T. We study conditions under which x0 can be stably recovered from the measurements. In the noise-free setting we show that the number of measurements needed to ensure a unique and stable solution depends on the set T through its Gaussian mean-width, which can be computed explicitly for many sets of interest. In particular, for k-sparse inputs, O(klog(n/k)) measurements suffice, while if x0 is an arbitrary vector in Rn, O(n) measurements are sufficient. In the noisy case, we show that if the empirical risk is bounded by a given, computable constant that depends only on statistical properties of the noise, the error with respect to the true input is bounded by the same Gaussian parameter (up to logarithmic factors). Therefore, the number of measurements required for stable recovery is the same as in the noise-free setting up to log factors. It turns out that the complexity parameter for the quadratic problem is the same as the one used for analyzing stability in linear measurements under very general conditions. Thus, no substantial price has to be paid in terms of stability when there is no knowledge of the phase of the measurements."

  abstract     = {The most fundamental notion in frame theory is the frame expansion of a vector. Although it is well known that these expansions are unconditionally convergent series, no characterizations of the unconditional constant were known. This has made it impossible to get accurate quantitative estimates for problems which require using subsequences of a frame. We will prove some new results in frame theory by showing that the unconditional constants of the frame expansion of a vector in a Hilbert space are bounded by BA, where A,B are the frame bounds of the frame. Tight frames thus have unconditional constant one, which we then generalize by showing that Bessel sequences have frame expansions with unconditional constant one if and only if the sequence is an orthogonal sum of tight frames. We give further results concerning frame expansions, in which we examine when BA is actually attained or not. We end by discussing the connections of this work to frame multipliers. These results hold in both real and complex Hilbert spaces.},

In particular, we prove that some inverse nonstationary Gabor frame operators admit a Walnut-like representation, i.e. the operator acting on a function can be described by weighted translates of that function. In this case, which only occurs when compactly supported window functions are used, the canonical dual frame partially inherits the structure of the original frame, with differences that we describe in detail. Moreover, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a pair of nonstationary Gabor frames to form dual frames, valid under mild restrictions. This condition is then applied in a simple setup, to prove the existence of dual pairs of nonstationary Gabor systems with coarser frequency sampling than allowed by previous results [3]. We also explore a connection to recent work of Christensen, Kim and Kim on Gabor frames with compactly supported window function.},

By using a simple signal model for audio signals, specific properties of Gabor scattering are studied. It is shown that, for each layer, specific invariances to certain signal characteristics occur. Furthermore, deformation stability of the coefficient vector generated by the feature extractor is derived by using a decoupling technique which exploits the contractivity of general scattering networks. Deformations are introduced as changes in spectral shape and frequency modulation. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples and experiments. Numerical evidence is given by evaluation on a synthetic and a &ldquo;real&rdquo; dataset, that the invariances encoded by the Gabor scattering transform lead to higher performance in comparison with just using Gabor transform, especially when few training samples are available.},

Given frame sequences {?(·?k)}k?Z and {?1(·?k)}k?Z, we present an easily verifiable condition implying that span{?1(·?k)}k?Z contains a generator for a shift-invariant dual of {?(·?k)}k?Z; in particular, the exact statement of this result implies the somewhat surprising fact that there is a unique conventional dual frame that is shift-invariant. As an application of our results we consider frame sequences generated by B-splines, and show how to construct oblique duals with prescribed regularity.},

  abstract  = {We define a very generic class of multiresolution analysis of abstract Hilbert spaces. Their core subspaces have a frame produced by the action of an abelian unitary group on a countable frame multiscaling vector set, which may be infinite. We characterize all the associated frame multiwavelet vector sets and we generalize the concept of low and high pass filters. We also prove a generalization of the quadratic (conjugate) mirror filter condition, and we give two algorithms for the construction of the high pass filters associated to a given low pass filter.},

  abstract     = {Abstract We derive necessary density conditions for sampling and for interpolation in general reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces satisfying some natural conditions on the geometry of the space and the reproducing kernel. If the volume of shells is small compared to the volume of balls (weak annular decay property) and if the kernel possesses some off-diagonal decay or even some weaker form of localization, then there exists a critical density D with the following property: a set of sampling has density ?D, whereas a set of interpolation has density ?D. The main theorem unifies many known density theorems in signal processing, complex analysis, and harmonic analysis. For the special case of bandlimited function we recover Landau's fundamental density result. In complex analysis we rederive a critical density for generalized Fock spaces. In harmonic analysis we obtain the first general result about the density of coherent frames.},

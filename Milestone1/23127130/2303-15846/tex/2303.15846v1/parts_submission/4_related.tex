% Using NLP for medical data
Recent years have seen the release of many English-language PLMs (pre)trained on clinical data~\cite{golmaei_deepnote-gnn_2021,rasmy_med-bert_2021,li_hi-behrt_2021,kim_deep-learning-based_2021}.
Dutch-language PLMs are much more rare, and even more so in the medical domain: we are only aware of Verkijk and Vossen's PLM~\cite{Verkijk_Vossen_2021}, which is pretrained on hospital patient notes.
% Cancer prediction
Whereas a variety of models predict cancer incidence or survival based on hospital notes \cite{kim_deep-learning-based_2021,aken_clinical_2021}, we only know of Torec et al.~\cite{torec-et-al2021w2vlungcancer}'s model that use \textit{free-text GP notes} as predictors.
% (fewshot) Soft prompt tuning
In recent years, a large variety of prompt tuning methods have become available.
Prompt tuning approaches use a fraction of the data and compute compared to models that fine-tune all parameters in a PLM, which is one of the main reasons we investigate prompt tuning in our work~\cite{li_prefix-tuning_2021,liu_gpt_2021}.

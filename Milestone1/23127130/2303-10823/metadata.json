    "abstract": "repetition frequency (PRF). Given the system complexity and resource constraints, it is often difficult to achieve high imaging performance and low ambiguity without compromising the swath. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization framework for sparse strip SAR imaging algorithms and azimuth undersampling patterns based on a deep convolutional neural network, combined with matched filter (MF) approximate measurement operators and inverse MF operators, referred to as MF-JMoDL-Net, for sparse SAR imaging methods. Compared with conventional sparse SAR imaging, MF-JMoDL-Net enables us to alleviate the limitations imposed by PRF. In the proposed scheme, joint and continuous optimization of azimuth undersampling patterns and convolutional neural network parameters are implemented to suppress azimuth ambiguity and enhance sparse SAR imaging quality. Experiments and comparisons under various conditions demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework in imaging results.",

  abstract = {The chemisorption energy is an integral aspect of surface chemistry, central to numerous fields such as catalysis, corrosion, and nanotechnology. Electronic-structure-based methods such as the Newns-Anderson model are therefore of great importance in guiding the engineering of material surfaces with optimal properties. However, existing methods are inadequate for interpreting complex, multi-metallic systems. Herein, we introduce a physics-based chemisorption model for alloyed transition metal surfaces employing primarily metal d-band properties that accounts for perturbations in both the substrate and adsorbate electronic states upon interaction. Importantly, we show that adsorbate-induced changes in the adsorption site interact with its chemical environment leading to a second-order response in chemisorption energy with the d-filling of the neighboring atoms. We demonstrate the robustness of the model on a wide range of transition metal alloys with O, N, CH, and Li adsorbates yielding a mean absolute error of 0.13 eV versus density functional theory reference chemisorption energies.},

  abstract = {The need for efficient ammonia synthesis is as urgent as ever. Over the past two decades, many attempts to find new catalysts for ammonia synthesis at mild conditions have been reported and, in particular, many new promoters of the catalytic rate have been introduced beyond the traditional K and Cs oxides. Herein, we provide an overview of recent experimental results for non-traditional promoters and develop a comprehensive model to explain how they work. The model has two components. First, we establish what is the most likely structure of the active sites in the presence of the different promoters. We then show that there are two effects dictating the catalytic activity. One is an electrostatic interaction between the adsorbed promoter and the N-N dissociation transition state. In addition, we identify a new promoter effect for magnetic catalysts giving rise to an anomalously large lowering of the activation energy opening the possibility of finding new ammonia synthesis catalysts.},

  abstract = {Scaling relationships are theoretical constructs that relate the binding energies of a wide variety of catalytic intermediates across a range of catalyst surfaces. Such relationships are ultimately derived from bond order conservation principles that were first introduced several decades ago. Through the growing power of computational surface science and catalysis, these concepts and their applications have recently begun to have a major impact in studies of catalytic reactivity and heterogeneous catalyst design. In this review, the detailed theory behind scaling relationships is discussed, and the existence of these relationships for catalytic materials ranging from pure metal to oxide surfaces, for numerous classes of molecules, and for a variety of catalytic surface structures is described. The use of the relationships to understand and elucidate reactivity trends across wide classes of catalytic surfaces and, in some cases, to predict optimal catalysts for certain chemical reactions, is explored. Finally, the observation that, in spite of the tremendous power of scaling relationships, their very existence places limits on the maximum rates that may be obtained for the catalyst classes in question is discussed, and promising strategies are explored to overcome these limitations to usher in a new era of theory-driven catalyst design.},

The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, however---gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals. To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table. We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold.},

The influences of the doping (p- or n-type), surface condition (clean or covered with monohydride) and varied excitation energy have been examined. The data for the Si–H surfaces are most extensive and distinct and undisturbed by background or losses. The CT times, which are identical for n- and p-type materials, are found to be about 2 fs at resonance. They show a distinct energy dependence when broadly tuning the excitation energy through the Ar core resonance. The CT times on clean Si(100), for which the data are not as extensive, are shorter by a factor of ∼2 compared to the Si–H surfaces and again about the same for n- and p-type Si(100). The unexpectedly short CT times found, as well as the energetic structure seen, are discussed in terms of possible influences of the projected surface electronic structure of Si(100) in the energy range of the Ar 4s electron, and of other explanations. Theoretical modeling would be highly desirable.},

They differ roughly by a factor of two with the fastest transfer time being observed for Ni(111) and the slowest for Ag(111).

We show that electronic states in the entire valence band of the metal surface are responsible for the reactivity, which consequently cannot be understood solely in terms of the density of states at the Fermi nor in terms d-states above it. Rather we suggest that trends in reactivities can be understood in terms of the hybridization energy between the bonding and anti-bonding adsorbate states and the metal d-bands (when present), and we demonstrate that a simple frozen potential based estimate of the hybridization energy correlates well with the calculated variation of the barrier height for the different metal surfaces.},

Current strategies for the catalyst design focus on increasing the number and activity of local catalytic sites, such as the edge sites of molybdenum disulfides in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, the study proposes and demonstrates a different principle that goes beyond local site optimization by utilizing topological electronic states to spur catalytic activity. For HER, excellent catalysts have been found among the transition-metal monopnictides—NbP, TaP, NbAs, and TaAs—which are recently discovered to be topological Weyl semimetals. Here the study shows that the combination of robust topological surface states and large room temperature carrier mobility, both of which originate from bulk Dirac bands of the Weyl semimetal, is a recipe for high activity HER catalysts. This approach has the potential to go beyond graphene based composite photocatalysts where graphene simply provides a high mobility medium without any active catalytic sites that have been found in these topological materials. Thus, the work provides a guiding principle for the discovery of novel catalysts from the emerging field of topological materials.},

These surface states are commonly employed to benchmark the capability of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Here we show that these Shockley surface states can be reinterpreted as topologically derived surface states (TDSSs) of a topological insulator (TI), a recently discovered quantum state. Based on band structure calculations, the Z2-type invariants of gold can be well-defined to characterize a TI. Further, our ARPES measurement validates TDSSs by detecting the dispersion of unoccupied surface states. The same TDSSs are also recognized on surfaces of other well-known noble metals (for example, silver, copper, platinum and palladium), which shines a new light on these long-known surface states.},

This chapter deals with the phenomenon of heterogeneous catalysis. It begins with a description of concepts that allow the understanding of variations in the reactivity from one surface to the next. These variations are essential to the understanding of heterogeneous catalysis, because they hold the key to distinguishing between a good and a bad catalyst. This chapter exploits the experiment-theory combination to build an understanding of variations in bond energies form one metal to the next. In this regard, it demonstrates that it is through an understanding of these variations, that concepts that allow determining why a particular surface is be a good catalyst for a given reaction, while other surfaces are not, are understood. This chapter also introduces descriptors that can be used to characterize the catalytic properties of a surface. It illustrates how surface bonding and catalytic activity are closely related. One of the main conclusions is that adsorption energies of the main intermediates in a surface catalyzed reaction are often a very good descriptor of the catalytic activity. It also demonstrates that the variation in adsorption energies from one transition metal to the next and the variation from one surface geometrical structure to the next can be understood on the basis of a model describing the coupling between the adsorbate states and the transition metal d states. Finally, it states that theoretical methods need further development with a higher accuracy to describe the finer details including possibly catalyst selectivity.},

  abstract = {2D electrode materials are often deployed on conductive supports for electrochemistry and there is a great need to understand fundamental electrochemical processes in this electrode configuration. Here, an integrated experimental-theoretical approach is used to resolve the key electronic interactions in outer-sphere electron transfer (OS-ET), a cornerstone elementary electrochemical reaction, at graphene as-grown on a copper electrode. Using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy, and co-located structural microscopy, the classical hexaamineruthenium (III/II) couple shows the ET kinetics trend: monolayer > bilayer > multilayer graphene. This trend is rationalized quantitatively through the development of rate theory, using the Schmickler-Newns-Anderson model Hamiltonian for ET, with the explicit incorporation of electrostatic interactions in the double layer, and parameterized using constant potential density functional theory calculations. The ET mechanism is predominantly adiabatic; the addition of subsequent graphene layers increases the contact potential, producing an increase in the effective barrier to ET at the electrode/electrolyte interface.},

Numerical calculations with parameters chosen to represent some features of the adsorption of hydrogen, and sodium atoms by tungsten are reported, and it is shown that, whereas overlap is essential in a quantitative treatment of the binding energies, the work of elucidating the electronic structures of adsorbed atoms can be started without including it explicitly in the theory.},

This interaction, which is an indirect one, can arise because a discrete atomic level which lies in the conduction band of the metal is broadened and becomes a virtual level when the atom is chemisorbed. The two virtual levels going with two chemisorbed atoms only coincide when the atoms are infinitely far apart, otherwise the virtual levels are split. If the Fermi level falls near the original virtual level, the occupancy of the two virtual levels will be sensitive to this splitting, and because of this there will be a significant interaction between the chemisorbed atoms. This is likely to occur with the alkali metal atoms on tungsten and nickel, and with hydrogen, but not for many molecules. An investigation using a simple model shows that the indirect interaction is long range (inverse square law) and oscillatory.},

  abstract  = {The excitation of magnetically ordered materials with ultrashort laser pulses results in magnetization dynamics on femto- to picosecond timescales. These non-equilibrium spin dynamics have emerged as a rapidly developing research field in recent years. Unraveling the fundamental microscopic processes in the interaction of ultrashort optical pulses with the charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in magnetic materials shows the potential for controlling spin dynamics on their intrinsic timescales and thereby bring spintronics applications into the femtosecond range. In particular, femtosecond spin currents offer fascinating new possibilities to manipulate magnetization in an ultrafast and non-local manner, via spin injection and spin transfer torque at the interfaces of ferromagnetic layered structures. This topical review covers recent progress on spin dynamics at interfaces on femtosecond time scales. The development of the field of ultrafast spin dynamics in ferromagnetic heterostructures will be reviewed, starting from spin currents propagating on nanometer length scales through layered structures before focusing on femtosecond spin transfer at interfaces. The properties of these ultrafast spin-dependent charge currents will be discussed, as well as the materials dependence of femtosecond spin injection, the role of the interface properties, and competing microscopic processes leading to a loss of spin polarization on sub-picosecond timescales.},

The small difference may be attributed to different representations, diabatic from MSDFT and adiabatic from ab initio calculations.

These results are at variance with the apparently similar alkali/Cu systems where a strong reduction of the resonance decay by one-electron transfer to the substrate as compared to a free-electron metal surface is observed and attributed to the presence of the surface projected band gap. The differences between the two systems are analysed, allowing a discussion of the situations where a projected band gap induced stabilisation can be expected.

  abstract  = {The magnetic properties of iron (spin and orbital magnetic moments, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy) in various geometries and dimensionalities are investigated by using a parametrized tight-binding model in an s, p and d atomic orbital basis set including spin polarization and the effect of spin–orbit coupling. The validity of this model is well established by comparing the results with those obtained by using an ab initio code. This model is applied to the study of iron in bulk bcc and fcc phases, (110) and (001) surfaces and the monatomic wire, at several interatomic distances. New results are derived. In the case of surfaces the variation of the component of the orbital magnetic moment on the spin quantization axis has been studied as a function of depth, revealing a significant enhancement in the first two layers, especially for the (001) surface. It is found that the magnetic anisotropy energy is drastically increased in the wire and can reach several meV. This is also true for the orbital moment, which in addition is highly anisotropic. Furthermore, it is shown that when the spin quantization axis is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the wire the average orbital moment is not aligned with the spin quantization axis. At equilibrium distance the easy magnetization axis is along the wire but switches to the perpendicular direction under compression. The success of this model opens up the possibility of obtaining accurate results on other elements and systems with much more complex geometries.},

PyCDFT provides an object-oriented, customizable implementation of CDFT, and allows for both single-point self-consistent-field calculations and geometry optimizations. PyCDFT is designed to interface with existing density functional theory (DFT) codes to perform CDFT calculations where constraint potentials are added to the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian. Here, we demonstrate the use of PyCDFT by performing calculations with a massively parallel first-principles molecular dynamics code, Qbox, and we benchmark its accuracy by computing the electronic coupling between diabatic states for a set of organic molecules. We show that PyCDFT yields results in agreement with existing implementations and is a robust and flexible package for performing CDFT calculations. The program is available at https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3821097.},

  abstract  = {{The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM), both capable of visualizing and manipulating individual atoms, are the cornerstones of nanoscience and nanotechnology today. The inventors of STM, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, were awarded with the Nobel Prize of physics in 1986. Both microscopes are based on mechanically scanning an atomically sharp tip over a sample surface, with quantum-mechanical tunneling or atomic forces between the tip and the atoms on the sample as the measurable quantities. This book presents the principles of STM and AFM, and the experimental details. Part I presents the principles from a unified point of view: the Bardeen theory of tunneling phenomenon, and the Herring-Landau theory of covalent-bond force. The similarity between those two theories, both rooted from the Heisenberg-Pauling concept of quantum-mechanical resonance, points to the equivalence of tunneling and covalent-bond force. The Tersoff-Hamann model of STM is presented, including the original derivation. The mechanisms of atomic-scale imaging of both STM and AFM are discussed. Part II presents the instrumentation and experimental techniques of STM and AFM, including piezoelectric scanners, vibration isolation, electronics and control, mechanical design, tip treatment and characterization, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and atomic force detection techniques. Part II ends with illustrative applications of STM and AFM in various fields of research and technology.}},

  abstract = {We have recently developed an ab initio scheme for the calculation of the electronic structure of surfaces. The method is based on the combination of density functional calculations using finite slabs and the use of recursive methods to obtain the Green’s function of the surface. The slab calculations are performed using a linear combination of atomic orbitals as a basis set. From such calculation we directly obtain the surface Hamiltonian in a tight-binding form. Combining this information with that from a bulk calculation of the substrate, we gather all the pieces to construct the Hamiltonian of the semi-infinite system. The surface Green’s function is then computed using the transfer-matrix method and projected onto a wavepacket localized in the surface region. The width and energy of the surface electronic features are obtained from the analysis of such projection. With this approach we get rid of the finite size effects associated with the slab calculations. We have applied this method to the calculation of resonant charge transfer times from adsorbates to metallic substrates. We have focused in the case of core-excited Ar and S on Ru(0001) to compare with core-hole clock spectroscopy experiments. We have also used our method to reveal the role of the elastic width in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of the quasi two-dimensional quantum well state appearing in p(2×2) ordered overlayers of Na and Cs on Cu(111). Here we present a new application of the method to study a more diluted alkali overlayer, the Cu(111)–(4×4)-Na surface. We present results for the relaxed geometries, binding energies, work function change and the position and width of the 3s Na resonance.},

  abstract  = {We present a series of numerically tabulated atom-centered orbital (NAO) basis sets with valence-correlation consistency (VCC), termed NAO-VCC-nZ. Here the index ‘nZ’ refers to the number of basis functions used for the valence shell with n = 2, 3, 4, 5. These basis sets are constructed analogous to Dunning's cc-pVnZ, but utilize the more flexible shape of NAOs. Moreover, an additional group of (sp) basis functions, called enhanced minimal basis, is established in NAO-VCC-nZ, increasing the contribution of the s and p functions to achieve the valence-correlation consistency. NAO-VCC-nZ basis sets are generated by minimizing frozen-core random-phase approximation (RPA) total energies of individual atoms from H to Ar. We demonstrate that NAO-VCC-nZ basis sets are suitable for converging electronic total-energy calculations based on valence-only (frozen-core) correlation methods which contain explicit sums over unoccupied states (e.g. the RPA or second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory). The basis set incompleteness error, including the basis set superposition error, can be gradually reduced with the increase of the index ‘n’, and can be removed using two-point extrapolation schemes.},

The charge transfer pathway was unambiguously defined by resonant excitation of the nitrile tailgroup attached to the alkyl backbone. Extension of this approach to other functional groups is possible, leading to new information valuable for molecular electronics and other applications.},

We use the natural lifetime of the core-excited states, which is on the order of a few femtoseconds for the systems investigated, as an internal clock of the adsorbate systems.},

We discuss the absolute energy scale, functional dependence, broadening versus sampling of intra- and intermolecular vibrational modes, treatment of the continuum, cluster size convergence as well as compare with periodic calculations and with experiment; periodic and cluster model calculations are found to agree very closely in the relevant near-edge region although neither reproduces the pre-edge and main-edge features in the experimental spectra of thin ice films. The real-space grid representation of the wave function in the periodic calculations allows a more extended energy range to be described and we find satisfactory agreement with experiment for higher energy continuum resonances. Two proposed alternative approaches using either the potential from a full core-hole (FCH) or the full core-hole with an excited electron in the lowest state (XCH) are shown to lead to spectra that deviate significantly from experiment.},

  abstract = {The effective Hamiltonian method for nuclear reactions described in an earlier paper with the same title, part I, is generalized so as to include all possible reaction types, as well as the effects arising from the identity of particles. The principal device employed, as in part I, is the projection operator which selects the open channel components of the wave function. It is found that the formal structure of part I providing a unified description for direct and compound nuclear reactions including the coupled equation description for direct reactions remains valid in this wider context. A Kapur-Peierls expansion may also be readily obtained. The concept of channel radii is not needed nor is any decomposition of the wave function for the system into angular momentum eigenstates required, so that the expressions for transition amplitudes and widths are invariant with respect to the angular momentum coupling scheme. Since the open channels can only be defined in an asymptotic sense, the corresponding projection operators are not unique. As a consequence the projection operator method has a flexibility which in the first place is consonant with the wide range of phenomena which can occur in nuclear reactions and in the second place can effectively exploit an intuitive understanding of the phenomena. Example of projection operators are obtained including one which leads to the Wigner-Eisenbud formalism, another which is appropriate for the stripping reaction, and, finally, one which takes the Pauli exclusion principle into account. Note that explicit representations of the projection operators are not required for the development of general formal results but are necessary if, eventually, quantitative calculations are made.},

This method is compared with results obtained by projection of the pair of molecules' molecular orbitals onto the vector space defined by the molecular orbitals of each isolated molecule.

These approaches include the constrained DFT (CDFT) method{,} the constrained noninteracting electron (CNE) model to post-process Kohn–Sham operators{,} the approximate block-diagonalization (BD) of the Kohn–Sham operators{,} and the generalized Mulliken–Hush method. It is shown that the first three approaches provide a good description for long-distance intermolecular electron transfer (ET) reactions. On the other hand{,} inconsistent results were found when applying these approaches to intramolecular ET in strongly coupled{,} mixed-valence systems. Model analysis shows that this discrepancy is caused by the inappropriate use of the two-state model rather than the defects of the approaches themselves. The situation is much improved when more states are included in the model electronic Hamiltonian. The CNE and BD approaches can thus serve as efficient and robust alternatives for building ET models based on DFT calculations.},

Computer simulations are carried out for a wide range of reorganisation energy (λ){,} electronic coupling strength (Hab) and driving force using our recently developed fragment orbital-based SH approach augmented with a simple decoherence correction. This methodology allows us to compute SH ET rates over more than four orders of magnitude{,} from the sub-picosecond to the nanosecond time regime. We find good agreement with semi-classical ET theory in the non-adiabatic ET regime. The correct scaling of the SH ET rate with electronic coupling strength is obtained and the Marcus inverted regime is reproduced{,} in line with previously reported results for a spin-boson model. Yet{,} we find that the SH ET rate falls below the semi-classical ET rate in the adiabatic regime{,} where the free energy barrier is in the order of kBT in our simulations. We explain this by first signatures of non-exponential population decay of the initial charge state. For even larger electronic couplings (Hab = λ/2){,} the free energy barrier vanishes and ET rates are no longer defined. At this point we observe a crossover from ET on the vibronic time scale to charge relaxation on the femtosecond time scale that is well described by thermally averaged Rabi oscillations. The extension of the analysis from the non-adiabatic limit to large electronic couplings and small or even vanishing activation barriers is relevant for our understanding of charge transport in organic semiconductors.},

We show that the problem is intrinsic in three-dimensionally extended systems, but is not as serious in systems with extension in fewer dimensions. The possibility of choosing suitable basis sets that avoid linear dependence is discussed. It is shown that for systems extended in three dimensions in which the orbitals near the Fermi-level are well described by plane waves a mixed atomicorbital/plane-wave (AO–PW) basis set with tight orbitals to describe the cores avoids the problem in the most efficient way. Numerical experiments with 1s Slater-type orbitals and plane waves on a simple cubic lattice are presented for illustration. © 1992 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

In particular{,} we show that the exponential decay constant for electronic coupling (β) is proportional to the square-root of the band gap of MgO. Therefore{,} it is essential to use an exchange–correlation functional which predicts the correct band gap for accurate prediction of electron tunnelling rates. We also present a scheme for the correction of finite size effects for electronic coupling due to the interaction with periodic images{,} and discuss the sensitivity of the results with respect to the charge constraint used. The computationally demanding calculations presented in this work have only become feasible owing to recent advances in both computer hardware and code parallelisation and demonstrate that the first principles modelling of long-range electron transfer in wide-gap oxides is now possible.},

  abstract = {The function of DNA during oxidative stress1 and its suitability as a potential building block for molecular devices2,3,4 depend on long-distance transfer of electrons and holes through the molecule, yet many conflicting measurements of the efficiency of this process have been reported5,6. It is accepted that charges are transported over long distances through a multistep hopping reaction7,8,9,10,11; this `G-hopping'8 involves positive charges moving between guanines (Gs), the DNA bases with the lowest ionization potential. But the mechanism fails to explain the persistence of efficient charge transfer when the guanine sites are distant7,12, where transfer rates do not, as expected, decrease rapidly with transfer distance. Here we show experimentally that the rate of charge transfer between two guanine bases decreases with increasing separation only if the guanines are separated by no more than three base pairs; if more bridging base pairs are present, the transfer rates exhibit only a weak distance dependence. We attribute this distinct change in the distance dependence of the rate of charge transfer through DNA to a shift from coherent superexchange charge transfer (tunnelling) at short distances to a process mediated by thermally induced hopping of charges between adenine bases (A-hopping) at long distances. Our results confirm theoretical predictions of this behaviour13,14,15,16,17, emphasizing that seemingly contradictory observations of a strong8,9 as well as a weak7,12 influence of distance on DNA charge transfer are readily explained by a change in the transfer mechanism.},

  abstract = {The corpus of electron transfer (ET) theory provides considerable power to describe the kinetics and dynamics of electron flow at the nanoscale. How is it, then, that nucleic acid (NA) ET continues to surprise, while protein-mediated ET is relatively free of mechanistic bombshells? I suggest that this difference originates in the distinct electronic energy landscapes for the two classes of reactions. In proteins, the donor/acceptor-to-bridge energy gap is typically several-fold larger than in NAs. NA ET can access tunneling, hopping, and resonant transport among the bases, and fluctuations can enable switching among mechanisms; protein ET is restricted to tunneling among redox active cofactors and, under strongly oxidizing conditions, a few privileged amino acid side chains. This review aims to provide conceptual unity to DNA and protein ET reaction mechanisms. The establishment of a unified mechanistic framework enabled the successful design of NA experiments that switch electronic coherence effects on and off for ET processes on a length scale of multiple nanometers and promises to provide inroads to directing and detecting charge flow in soft-wet matter.},

Finite difference solutions to the linear PB equation are then used to calculate $\lambda$ for intramolecular electron transfer reactions in the photosynthetic reaction center from Rhodopseudomonas viridis and the ruthenated heme proteins cytochrome c, myoglobin, and cytochrome b and for intermolecular electron transfer between two cytochrome c molecules. The overall agreement with experiment is good considering both the experimental and computational difficulties in estimating $\lambda$. The calculations show that acceptor/donor separation and position of the cofactors with respect to the protein/solvent boundary are equally important and, along with the overall polarizability of the protein, are the major determinants of $\lambda$. In agreement with previous studies, the calculations show that the protein provides a low reorganization environment for electron transfer. Agreement with experiment is best if the protein polarizability is modeled with a low (<8) average effective dielectric constant. The effect of buried waters on the reorganization energy of the photosynthetic reaction center was examined and found to make a contribution ranging from 0.05eV to 0.27eV, depending on the donor/acceptor pair.},

The presence of the conical intersection strengthens considerably the nonadiabatic effects in the nuclear motion.

  abstract = {The effect of low-energy (15-200-eV) electrons on hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and barium adsorbed on tungsten has been investigated by a field-emission technique. Desorption cross sections $\sigma$ were determined from work function and Fowler-Nordheim pre-exponential changes and are significantly smaller than would be expected for comparable molecular processes. Marked variations in cross section with binding mode within a given system were found. Thus $\sigma$H = 3.5 10-20 cm2 and 5×10-21 cm2 for processes tentatively interpreted as the splitting of molecularly adsorbed H2 and desorption of H, respectively; <ro=4.2×10-19 cm2 for a loosely bound state and $\sigma$0≥2×10-21 cm2 for all other states; <TBa<2×10-22 cm2 under all conditions. In the case of CO (reported in detail elsewhere), three binding modes observed previously could be confirmed and differentiated by their different cross sections: 3×10-19 cm2; = 5.8×1021 cm2, <ra = 3×10 -18 cm2; conversion by electrons of virgin to $\beta$ cm2. These results are interpreted in terms of transitions from the adsorbed ground state to repulsive portions of excited states, followed by de-exciting transitions which prevent desorption. Arguments are made to show that the excitation cross sections should be essentially "normal," i.e., ∼10-16 to 10-17 cm2, and that the much smaller over-all cross sections observed are due to high transition probabilities to the ground state, estimated as 1014 to 1015 sec-1. A detailed calculation for the case of exponentially varying transition probabilities and repulsive upper states is presented and discussed, and the variations in cross section with binding mode made plausible. It is shown that low-energy electron impact constitutes a sensitive tool for studying chemisorption.},

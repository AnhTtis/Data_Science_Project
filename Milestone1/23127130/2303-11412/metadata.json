    "abstract": "We study the electronic coupling between an adsorbate and a metal surface by calculating tunneling matrix elements H$_{\\text{ad}}$ directly from first principles. For this we employ a projection of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian upon a diabatic basis using a version of the popular Projection-Operator Diabatization approach. An appropriate integration of couplings over the Brillouin zone allows the first calculation of a size-convergent Newns-Anderson chemisorption function, a coupling-weighted density of states measuring the line broadening of an adsorbate frontier state upon adsorption. This broadening corresponds to the experimentally-observed lifetime of an electron in the state, which we confirm for core-excited $\\text{Ar}^{*}(2{p}_{3/2}^{-1}4s)$ atoms on a number of transition metal (TM) surfaces. Yet, beyond just lifetimes, the chemisorption function is highly interpretable and encodes rich information on orbital phase interactions on the surface. The model thus captures and elucidates key aspects of the electron transfer process. Finally, a decomposition into angular momentum components reveals the hitherto unresolved role of the hybridized $d$-character of the TM surface in the resonant electron transfer, and elucidates the coupling of the adsorbate to the surface bands over the entire energy scale.",

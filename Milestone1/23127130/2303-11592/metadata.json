    "abstract": "Recent deep-learning-based video compression methods brought coding gains over conventional codecs such as AVC and HEVC. However, learning-based codecs generally require considerable computation time and model complexity. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight hybrid video codec consisting of a conventional video codec(HEVC / VVC), a lossless image codec, and our new restoration network. Precisely, our encoder consists of the conventional video encoder and a lossless image encoder, transmitting a lossy-compressed video bitstream along with a losslessly-compressed reference frame. The decoder is constructed with corresponding video/image decoders and a new restoration network, which enhances the compressed video in two-step processes. In the first step, a network trained with a large video dataset restores the details lost by the conventional encoder. Then, we further boost the video quality with the guidance of a reference image, which is a losslessly compressed video frame. The reference image provides video-specific information, which can be utilized to better restore the details of a compressed video. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to top-tier methods, even when applied to HEVC. Nevertheless, our method has lower complexity, a faster run time, and can be easily integrated into existing conventional codecs.",

It is constructed using the uncertainty quantification software UQLab using a spectral decomposition method called polynomial chaos expansion. All steps in its construction have been tested and optimized: the large high-resolution N-body simulations carried out with PKDGRAV3 were validated using a simulation from the Euclid Flagship campaign and demonstrated to have converged up to wavenumbers \\$k\\approx 5\\, h\\, \\{\\rm Mpc\\}^\\{-1\\}\\$ for redshifts \\$z\\$ ≤ 5. The emulator is based on 100 input cosmologies simulated in boxes of (1250 Mpc/h)3 using 20483 particles. We show that by creating mock emulators it is possible to successfully predict and optimize the performance of the final emulator prior to performing any N-body simulations. The absolute accuracy of the final nonlinear power spectrum is as good as one obtained with N-body simulations, conservatively, \\$\\{\\sim \\} 1\\$ per cent for \\$k\\lesssim 1\\, h\\, \\{\\rm Mpc\\}^\\{-1\\}\\$ and \\$z\\$ ≲ 1. This enables efficient forward modelling in the nonlinear regime, allowing for estimation of cosmological parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. EuclidEmulator has been compared to HALOFIT, CosmicEmu, and NGenHalofit, and shown to be more accurate than these other approaches. This work paves a new way for optimal construction of future emulators that also consider other cosmological observables, use higher resolution input simulations, and investigate higher dimensional cosmological parameter spaces.}",

    abstract = "{We present a new, updated version of the EuclidEmulator (called EuclidEmulator2), a fast and accurate predictor for the nonlinear correction of the matter power spectrum. 2 per cent level accurate emulation is now supported in the eight-dimensional parameter space of w0waCDM+∑mν models between redshift z = 0 and z = 3 for spatial scales within the range \\$0.01 \\, h\\, \\{\\rm Mpc\\}^\\{-1\\}\\le k \\le 10\\, h\\, \\{\\rm Mpc\\}^\\{-1\\}\\$. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, we have had to improve the quality of the underlying N-body simulations used as training data: (i) we use self-consistent linear evolution of non-dark matter species such as massive neutrinos, photons, dark energy, and the metric field, (ii) we perform the simulations in the so-called N-body gauge, which allows one to interpret the results in the framework of general relativity, (iii) we run over 250 high-resolution simulations with 30003 particles in boxes of 1(h−1 Gpc)3 volumes based on paired-and-fixed initial conditions, and (iv) we provide a resolution correction that can be applied to emulated results as a post-processing step in order to drastically reduce systematic biases on small scales due to residual resolution effects in the simulations. We find that the inclusion of the dynamical dark energy parameter wa significantly increases the complexity and expense of creating the emulator. The high fidelity of EuclidEmulator2 is tested in various comparisons against N-body simulations as well as alternative fast predictors such as HALOFIT, HMCode, and CosmicEmu. A blind test is successfully performed against the Euclid Flagship v2.0 simulation.

abstract = {In this article, we present a detailed overview of the literature on the design of computer experiments. We classify the existing literature broadly into two categories, viz. static and adaptive design of experiments (DoE). We begin with the abundant literature available on static DoE, its chronological evolution, and its pros and cons. Our discussion naturally points to the challenges that are faced by the static techniques. The adaptive DoE techniques employ intelligent and iterative strategies to address these challenges by combining system knowledge with space-filling for sample placement. We critically analyze the adaptive DoE literature based on the key features of placement strategies. Our numerical and visual analyses of the static DoE techniques reveal the excellent performance of Sobol sampling (SOB3) for higher dimensions; and that of Hammersley (HAM) and Halton (HAL) sampling for lower dimensions. Finally, we provide several potential opportunities for the future modern DoE research.}

	abstract = {Numerical simulations in modified gravity have commonly been performed under the quasi-static approximation—that is, by neglecting the effect of time derivatives in the equation of motion of the scalar field that governs the fifth force in a given modified gravity theory. To test the validity of this approximation, we analyse the case of f(R) gravity beyond this quasi-static limit, by considering effects, if any, these terms have in the matter and velocity divergence cosmic fields. To this end, we use the adaptive mesh refinement code ECOSMOG to study three variants (|fR|= 10−4[F4], 10−5[F5] and 10−6[F6]) of the Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity model, each of which refers to a different magnitude for the scalar field that generates the fifth force. We find that for F4 and F5, which show stronger deviations from standard gravity, a low-resolution simulation is enough to conclude that time derivatives make a negligible contribution to the matter distribution. The F6 model shows a larger deviation from the quasi-static approximation, but one that diminishes when re-simulated at higher-resolution. We therefore come to the conclusion that the quasi-static approximation is valid for the most practical applications in f(R) cosmologies.}

abstract = {In this review we present a thoroughly comprehensive survey of recent work on modified theories of gravity and their cosmological consequences. Amongst other things, we cover General Relativity, scalar–tensor, Einstein–æther, and Bimetric theories, as well as TeVeS, f(R), general higher-order theories, Hořava–Lifschitz gravity, Galileons, Ghost Condensates, and models of extra dimensions including Kaluza–Klein, Randall–Sundrum, DGP, and higher co-dimension braneworlds. We also review attempts to construct a Parameterised Post-Friedmannian formalism, that can be used to constrain deviations from General Relativity in cosmology, and that is suitable for comparison with data on the largest scales. These subjects have been intensively studied over the past decade, largely motivated by rapid progress in the field of observational cosmology that now allows, for the first time, precision tests of fundamental physics on the scale of the observable Universe. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference tool for researchers and students in cosmology and gravitational physics, as well as a self-contained, comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the subject as a whole.}

In this short review, we shall present the various screening mechanisms from an effective field theory point of view.

We find that accurate prediction of the matter power spectrum in f(R) gravity places stronger requirements on the simulation than is the case with Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) because of the non-linear nature of the fifth force. Linear perturbation theory is shown to be a poor approximation for the f(R) models, except when the chameleon effect is very weak. We show that the relative differences from the fiducial ΛCDM model are much more pronounced in the non-linear tail of the velocity divergence power spectrum than in the matter power spectrum, which suggests that future surveys which target the collection of peculiar velocity data will open new opportunities to constrain modified gravity theories. A close investigation of the time evolution of the power spectra shows that there is a pattern in the evolution history, which can be explained by the properties of the chameleon-type fifth force in f(R) gravity. Varying the model parameter |fR0|, which quantifies the strength of the departure from standard gravity, mainly varies the epoch marking the onset of the fifth force, as a result of which the different f(R) models are in different stages of the same evolutionary path at any given time.}",

This paper provides the first detailed comparison of the results of different N-body codes for the f (R), Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati and Symmetron models, starting from the same initial conditions. We find that the fractional deviation of the matter power spectrum from Λ cold dark matter agrees to better than 1 per cent up to k ∼ 5–10 h Mpc−1 between the different codes. These codes are thus able to meet the stringent accuracy requirements of upcoming observational surveys. All codes are also in good agreement in their results for the velocity divergence power spectrum, halo abundances and halo profiles. We also test the quasi-static limit, which is employed in most modified gravity N-body codes, for the Symmetron model for which the most significant non-static effects among the models considered are expected. We conclude that this limit is a very good approximation for all of the observables considered here.}",

As this new algorithm is implemented as a module for the p-gadget3 code, it can at the same time follow the baryonic physics included in p-gadget3, such as hydrodynamics, radiative cooling and star formation. We demonstrate that the code works reliably by applying it to simple test problems that can be solved analytically, as well as by comparing cosmological simulations to results from the literature. Using the new code, we perform the first non-radiative and radiative cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of an f (R)-gravity model.

These models deviate from standard general relativity (GR) more strongly in low-density regions and thus voids are a promising venue to test them. We use halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescriptions to populate haloes with galaxies, and tune the HOD parameters such that the galaxy two-point correlation functions are the same in both f(R) and GR models. We identify both three-dimensional (3D) voids and two-dimensional (2D) underdensities in the plane of the sky to find the same void abundance and void galaxy number density profiles across all models, which suggests that they do not contain much information beyond galaxy clustering. However, the underlying void dark matter density profiles are significantly different, with f(R) voids being more underdense than GR ones, which leads to f(R) voids having a larger tangential shear signal than their GR analogues. We investigate the potential of each void finder to test f(R) models with near-future lensing surveys such as euclid and lsst. The 2D voids have the largest power to probe f(R) gravity, with an lsst analysis of tunnel (which is a new type of 2D underdensity introduced here) lensing distinguishing at 80 and 11σ (statistical error) f(R) models with parameters, |fR0| = 10−5 and 10−6, from GR.}",

	abstract = {We have carried out a set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that follow galaxy formation in \$f(R)\$ modified gravity models. Our simulations employ the Illustris-TNG full physics model and a new modified gravity solver in the AREPO code. For the first time we are able to investigate the degeneracy in the matter power spectrum between the effects of \$f(R)\$-gravity and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN), and the imprint of modified gravity on the properties of galaxies and on the distribution of dark matter, gas and stars in the universe. \$f(R)\$-gravity has an observable effect on the neutral hydrogen power spectrum at high redshift at a level of 20\%. For both the F6 and F5 models, this is significantly larger than the predicted errors for the SKA1-MID survey, making this probe a powerful test of gravity on large scales. A similar effect is present in the power spectrum of the stars at high redshift. We also show that rotationally supported disc galaxies can form in \$f(R)\$-gravity, even in the partially screened regime. Our simulations indicate that there might be more disc galaxies in F6 compared to GR, and fewer in F5. Finally, we show that the back reaction between AGN feedback and modified gravity in the matter power spectrum is not important in the F6 model but has a sizeable effect in F5.},

journal = {\apj},
abstract = {We introduce a new cosmic emulator for the matter power spectrum covering eight cosmological parameters. Targeted at optical surveys, the emulator provides accurate predictions out to a wavenumber  Mpc−1 and redshift . In addition to covering the standard set of ΛCDM parameters, massive neutrinos and a dynamical dark energy of state are included. The emulator is built on a sample set of 36 cosmological models, carefully chosen to provide accurate predictions over the wide and large parameter space. For each model, we have performed a high-resolution simulation, augmented with 16 medium-resolution simulations and TimeRG perturbation theory results to provide accurate coverage over a wide k-range; the data set generated as part of this project is more than 1.2Pbytes. With the current set of simulated models, we achieve an accuracy of approximately 4%. Because the sampling approach used here has established convergence and error-control properties, follow-up results with more than a hundred cosmological models will soon achieve  accuracy. We compare our approach with other prediction schemes that are based on halo model ideas and remapping approaches. The new emulator code is publicly available.}

journal = {\apj},
abstract = {Based on a suite of state-of-the-art high-resolution N-body simulations, we revisit the so-called halofit model as an accurate fitting formula for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. While the halofit model has frequently been used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter, its precision has been limited by the low resolution of N-body simulations used to determine the fitting parameters, suggesting the necessity of an improved fitting formula at small scales for future cosmological studies. We run high-resolution N-body simulations for 16 cosmological models around the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe best-fit cosmological parameters (one-, three-, five-, and seven-year results), including dark energy models with a constant equation of state. The simulation results are used to re-calibrate the fitting parameters of the halofit model so as to reproduce small-scale power spectra of the N-body simulations, while keeping the precision at large scales. The revised fitting formula provides an accurate prediction of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a wide range of wavenumbers (k ⩽ 30 h Mpc−1) at redshifts 0 ⩽ z ⩽ 10, with 5% precision for k ⩽ 1 h Mpc−1 at 0 ⩽ z ⩽ 10 and 10% for 1 ⩽ k ⩽ 10 h Mpc−1 at 0 ⩽ z ⩽ 3. We discuss the impact of the improved halofit model on weak-lensing power spectra and correlation functions, and show that the improved model better reproduces ray-tracing simulation results.}

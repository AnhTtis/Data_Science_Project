abstract = {A transition between energy levels at an avoided crossing is known as a Landau–Zener transition. When a two-level system (TLS) is subject to periodic driving with sufficiently large amplitude, a sequence of transitions occurs. The phase accumulated between transitions (commonly known as the Stückelberg phase) may result in constructive or destructive interference. Accordingly, the physical observables of the system exhibit periodic dependence on the various system parameters. This phenomenon is often referred to as Landau–Zener–Stückelberg (LZS) interferometry. Phenomena related to LZS interferometry occur in a variety of physical systems. In particular, recent experiments on LZS interferometry in superconducting TLSs (qubits) have demonstrated the potential for using this kind of interferometry as an effective tool for obtaining the parameters characterizing the TLS as well as its interaction with the control fields and with the environment. Furthermore, strong driving could allow for fast and reliable control of the quantum system. Here we review recent experimental results on LZS interferometry, and we present related theory.}

abstract = {In these lecture notes, partly based on a course taught at the Karpacz Winter School in March 2014, we explore the close connections between non-adiabatic response of a system with respect to macroscopic parameters and the geometry of quantum and classical states. We center our discussion around adiabatic gauge potentials, which are the generators of unitary basis transformations in quantum systems and generators of special canonical transformations in classical systems. In quantum systems, eigenstate expectation values of these potentials are the Berry connections and the covariance matrix of these gauge potentials is the geometric tensor, whose antisymmetric part defines the Berry curvature and whose symmetric part is the Fubini-Study metric tensor. In classical systems one simply replaces the eigenstate expectation value by an average over the micro-canonical shell. For complicated interacting systems, we show that a variational principle may be used to derive approximate gauge potentials. We then express the non-adiabatic response of the physical observables of the system through these gauge potentials, specifically demonstrating the close connection of the geometric tensor to the notions of Lorentz force and renormalized mass. We highlight applications of this formalism to deriving counter-diabatic (dissipationless) driving protocols in various systems, as well as to finding equations of motion for slow macroscopic parameters coupled to fast microscopic degrees of freedom that go beyond macroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate these ideas with a number of simple examples and highlight a few more complicated ones drawn from recent literature.}

This not only induces transitions to unwanted final states but also changes the system energy, so that using the STA has a definite cost in terms of conventional work definitions. This may be the ultimate cost of an adiabatic shortcut, in the sense that it is present even for a frictionless, zero-temperature driving. We estimate the effect, to lowest nontrivial order in the derivatives of the time-dependent frequency, on a parametric harmonic oscillator, thus providing a consistency condition for the validity of the classical approximation.}},

Shortcuts have been developed for quantum, classical and (most recently) stochastic dynamics. A shortcut might involve a counterdiabatic (CD) Hamiltonian that causes a system to follow the adiabatic evolution at all times, or it might utilize a fast-forward (FF) potential, which returns the system to the adiabatic path at the end of the process. We develop a general framework for constructing shortcuts to adiabaticity from flow fields that describe the desired adiabatic evolution. Our approach encompasses quantum, classical and stochastic dynamics, and provides surprisingly compact expressions for both CD Hamiltonians and FF potentials. We illustrate our method with numerical simulations of a model system, and we compare our shortcuts with previously obtained results. We also consider the semiclassical connections between our quantum and classical shortcuts. Our method, like the FF approach developed by previous authors, is susceptible to singularities when applied to excited states of quantum systems; we propose a simple, intuitive criterion for determining whether these singularities will arise, for a given excited state.}},

The eSTA method works for previously intractable Hamiltonians by providing an analytical correction to existing STA protocols. This correction can be easily calculated, and the resulting protocols are outside the class of STA schemes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for three distinct cases: manipulation of an internal atomic state beyond the rotating-wave approximation, transport of a neutral atom in an optical Gaussian trap, and transport of two trapped ions in an anharmonic trap.}},

The shortcuts are designed by a set of analytical and numerical methods suitable for different systems and conditions. A motivation to apply STA methods to quantum systems is to manipulate them on timescales shorter than decoherence times. Thus shortcuts to adiabaticity have become instrumental in preparing and driving internal and motional states in atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics. Applications range from information transfer and processing based on gates or analog paradigms to interferometry and metrology. The multiplicity of STA paths for the controlling parameters may be used to enhance robustness versus noise and perturbations or to optimize relevant variables. Since adiabaticity is a widespread phenomenon, STA methods also extended beyond the quantum world to optical devices, classical mechanical systems, and statistical physics. Shortcuts to adiabaticity combine well with other concepts and techniques, in particular, with optimal control theory, and pose fundamental scientific and engineering questions such as finding speed limits, quantifying the third law, or determining process energy costs and efficiencies. Concepts, methods, and applications of shortcuts to adiabaticity are reviewed and promising prospects are outlined, as well as open questions and challenges ahead.}},

Geometric quantum control is thought to be a promising candidate for quantum computation which consolidates the robustness against both random noise (through the global geometrical feature) and systematic errors (through adiabatic characteristic). The adiabatic process of geometric control can be accelerated through an auxiliary Hamiltonian in different scenarios by means of shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA). Especially, the auxiliary Hamiltonian can be absorbed into the original interacting configuration in most of the cases, which allows STA to coalesce with the Abelian or the non‐Abelian geometric control. As a consequence, geometric quantum control can have an enhanced robustness against decoherence after speeding up by STA. Here, the recent theoretical and experimental advances in geometric quantum computation based on STA are reviewed. Fast and high‐fidelity quantum control is a key ingredient to realize large‐scale quantum computation. Geometric quantum computation with shortcuts to adiabaticity can consolidate the superiorities of both geometric and adiabatic control, and hence becomes an ideal candidate for quantum computation.

Here, we present the experimental demonstration of shortcuts to adiabaticity for open quantum systems, using a superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics system. By applying a counterdiabatic driving pulse, we reduce the adiabatic evolution time of a single lossy mode from 800 ns to 100 ns. In addition, we propose and implement an optimal control protocol to achieve fast and qubit-unconditional equilibrium of multiple lossy modes. Our results pave the way for precise time-domain control of open quantum systems and have potential applications in designing fast open-system protocols of physical and interdisciplinary interest, such as accelerating bioengineering and chemical reaction dynamics.}},

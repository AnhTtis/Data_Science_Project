\ABSTRACT{%
The conference peer review process involves three constituencies: authors desire (fast) acceptance in prestigious venues, conferences aim to accept more high-quality and fewer low-quality papers, and reviewers should be spared overwhelming workloads. These objectives often clash, in large part due to the noise inherent in peer review. In response, conferences have experimented with various policies, including adjusting acceptance thresholds and the number of reviews per submission. We investigate how well various policies work, and more importantly, why they do or do not work.
We model the conference-author interactions as a Stackelberg game: a prestigious conference commits to an acceptance policy, and authors respond by (re)submitting or not.
Using our model, we explain why many submissions are rejected every year (in practice, rejection rates reach approximately 75\%), despite many of them eventually being accepted at prestigious venues with minor improvements, a phenomenon we term the ``Resubmission Paradox''. \yzreplace{We show that reviewer inaccuracy and author patience encourage authors to (re)submit and thus increase the review workload for a fixed conference quality. }{We show that higher review quality benefits all three stakeholders: the conference can maintain the same quality with lower review burden and greater author welfare. Moreover, greater author patience leads to more persistent (re)submissions, thereby increasing the review workload for a fixed conference quality.}
For the robustness of these and other results, we consider variants of our model and conduct simulations based on plausible parameters estimated from real data.

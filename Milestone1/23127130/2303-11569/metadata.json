    "abstract": "This work represents a particular application of waveguide fabricated by femtosecond laser micromachining technology. More specifically, we report the development of an optical modulator based on the fabrication of single-mode optical waveguide structures buried in X-cut lithium niobate crystal with the femtosecond laser direct writing method. Here, change in refractive index profile is measured using near field intensity profile measurement method at optimized writing conditions. It has been observed that the change refractive index (Δn) is in the range of 10-4. Finally, the behavior of femtosecond written waveguides as an intensity modulator at 632.8 nm and 1550 nm under the influence of an external electric field is analyzed by pattering electrode structures on the substrate respectively.",

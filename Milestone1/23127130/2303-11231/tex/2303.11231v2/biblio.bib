abstract = {A class G of graphs is said to be χ-bounded if there is a function f:N→R such that for all G∈G and all induced subgraphs H of G, χ(H)⩽f(ω(H)). In this paper, we show that if G is a χ-bounded class, then so is the closure of G under any one of the following three operations: substitution, gluing along a clique, and gluing along a bounded number of vertices. Furthermore, if G is χ-bounded by a polynomial (respectively: exponential) function, then the closure of G under substitution is also χ-bounded by some polynomial (respectively: exponential) function. In addition, we show that if G is a χ-bounded class, then the closure of G under the operations of gluing along a clique and gluing along a bounded number of vertices together is also χ-bounded, as is the closure of G under the operations of substitution and gluing along a clique together.}

abstract = {Inspired by a width invariant defined on permutations by Guillemot and Marx [SODA’14], we introduce the notion of twin-width on graphs and on matrices. Proper minor-closed classes, bounded rank-width graphs, map graphs, Kt-free unit d-dimensional ball graphs, posets with antichains of bounded size, and proper subclasses of dimension-2 posets all have bounded twin-width. On all these classes (except map graphs without geometric embedding) we show how to compute in polynomial time a sequence of d-contractions, witness that the twin-width is at most d. We show that FO model checking, that is deciding if a given first-order formula ϕ evaluates to true for a given binary structure G on a domain D, is FPT in |ϕ| on classes of bounded twin-width, provided the witness is given. More precisely, being given a d-contraction sequence for G, our algorithm runs in time f(d,|ϕ |) · |D| where f is a computable but non-elementary function. We also prove that bounded twin-width is preserved under FO interpretations and transductions (allowing operations such as squaring or complementing a graph). This unifies and significantly extends the knowledge on fixed-parameter tractability of FO model checking on non-monotone classes, such as the FPT algorithm on bounded-width posets by Gajarsk\'{y} et al. [FOCS’15].},

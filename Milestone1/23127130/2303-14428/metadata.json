    "abstract": "This paper presents a new nested production function that is specifically designed for analyzing capital and labor intensity of manufacturing industries in developing and developed regions. The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for this production function, as well as an empirical analysis of its performance in a sample of industries. The analysis shows that the production function can be used to accurately estimate the level of capital and labor intensity in industries, as well as to analyze the capacity utilization of these industries.",

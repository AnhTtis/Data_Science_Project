    "abstract": "A transformation on homogeneous polynomials is proposed, which is further applied to parametric Feynman integrals. The two representations related through this transformation are dual to each other. And it naturally leads to dualities of Landau equations and linear integral relations between the two representations. For integrals with momentum-space correspondences, the dual representation is equivalent to the Baikov representation.",

  abstract = {This paper introduces the Affordance Template framework used to supervise task behaviors on the NASA-JSC Valkyrie robot at the 2013 DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Trials. This framework provides graphical interfaces to human supervisors that are adjustable based on the run-time environmental context (e.g., size, location, and shape of objects that the robot must interact with, etc.). Additional improvements, described below, inject degrees of autonomy into instantiations of affordance templates at run-time in order to enable efficient human supervision of the robot for accomplishing tasks.},

  abstract = {We present early pilot-studies of a new international project, developing advanced robotics to handle nuclear waste. Despite enormous remote handling requirements, there has been remarkably little use of robots by the nuclear industry. The few robots deployed have been directly teleoperated in rudimentary ways, with no advanced control methods or autonomy. Most remote handling is still done by an aging workforce of highly skilled experts, using 1960s style mechanical Master-Slave devices. In contrast, this paper explores how novice human operators can rapidly learn to control modern robots to perform basic manipulation tasks; also how autonomous robotics techniques can be used for operator assistance, to increase throughput rates, decrease errors, and enhance safety. We compare humans directly teleoperating a robot arm, against human-supervised semi-autonomous control exploiting computer vision, visual servoing and autonomous grasping algorithms. We show how novice operators rapidly improve their performance with training; suggest how training needs might scale with task complexity; and demonstrate how advanced autonomous robotics techniques can help human operators improve their overall task performance. An additional contribution of this paper is to show how rigorous experimental and analytical methods from human factors research, can be applied to perform principled scientific evaluations of human test-subjects controlling robots to perform practical manipulative tasks.},

	abstract = {Regular inspection of oil and gas installations are vital for production, maintenance, safety and environmental impact assessment. Due to complex set-up and hazardous operation environment, the inspection, maintenance and repair ({IMR}) operations as considered as an inevitable task in oil and gas industries. Integrating technologies from the field of robotics, sensing and process control will be a decisive step in digitalization of oil and gas industry. The traditional vertical structures inspection system uses rope access, scaffolds, telescopic elevation platforms supported by cranes and manned helicopters. The challenges faced by conventional techniques are the construction of scaffolding, sending inspectors into dangerous and fatal environments, shutdown of plant operations etc. that has financial burden on the plant operating cost. Introduction of robotic technologies such as wall-climbing robots, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ({UAV}) and wall-climbing drones, provides a possible solution for these challenges by increasing the efficiency, reducing the risks and lowering the cost of {IMR} tasks. The current research focus in this field is to automate and improve the inspection and testing capabilities of these systems. This paper presents the state of art of current scenario and future research focus on vertical structure inspection in oil and gas industry.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the {VaultBot} dual-arm mobile manipulator and its integration with Robot Operating System, {MoveIt}!, and {RViz}, and thus demonstrate how two chronic issues with similar systems were addressed: overly complex integration and user control. Multiple levels of semi-autonomous control were developed for the base, manipulator(s), and coordinated motions involving both. Lower levels of autonomy are always available to increase operator comfort. In order to combat cognitive load increases from context switching the control methods take a human-centered approach by automatically adjusting perspective to keep tasks visualized relative to the operator. Sensor data is fused into a single window alongside the current robot state. These approaches are considered highly intuitive and can be used as effectively as socially well-established mouse-based interactive markers for teleoperation in even high-precision tasks.},

In particular, the combination of spatial computing and egocentric sensing on mixed reality ({MR}) devices enables robots to capture and understand human behaviors and translate them to actions with spatial meaning, which offers exciting possibilities for collaboration between people and machines. This article presents several human–robot systems that utilize these capabilities to enable novel use cases: mission planning for inspection, gesture-based control, and immersive teleoperation. These works demonstrate the power of {MR} as a tool for human–robot interaction and the potential of spatial computing and {MR} to drive future developments.},

In fact, human-robot interaction design and the design of user interfaces have very much to gain from {MR} technologies. Nonetheless, designing the user-robot interaction and processing multimodal feedbacks are very challenging tasks. In this paper we focus in particular on interactions in mixed reality. The main contribution of this paper is the implementation of a control system for an industrial manipulator through the user's interactions with {MR} content displayed with the Microsoft {HoloLens}. The system is based on the communication between Unity3D (used to design the user experience) and {ROS}, therefore extendible to any {ROS}-compatible robotic hardware.},

    "abstract": "Let Sp($k$) denote the number of the $\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor$-element subsets of a finite $k$-element set. We prove that the least size of a generating subset of the Boolean lattice with $n$ atoms (or, equivalently, the powerset lattice of an $n$-element set) is the least number $k$ such that $n\\leq$ Sp($k$). Based on this fact, we present a secret key protocol for authentication and cryptography. Furthermore, we prove that the underlying mathematical problem of this protocol is likely to be harder than P in the sense that if it belongs to the complexity class P then P equals NP. We present some ideas (but not a proof) how to make our protocol hard on the average. Finally, as an easy observation, we present a subclass of (the NP-complete) 3SAT that is still NP-complete.",

\begin{abstract}
Class-Incremental Learning aims to update a deep classifier to learn new categories while maintaining or improving its accuracy on previously observed classes. Common methods to prevent forgetting previously learned classes include regularizing the neural network updates and storing exemplars in memory, which come with hyperparameters such as the learning rate, regularization strength, or the number of exemplars. However, these hyperparameters are usually only tuned at the start and then kept fixed throughout the learning sessions, ignoring the fact that newly encountered tasks may have varying levels of novelty or difficulty. This study investigates the necessity of hyperparameter `adaptivity' in Class-Incremental  Learning: the ability to dynamically adjust hyperparameters such as the learning rate, regularization strength, and memory size according to the properties of the new task at hand. We propose AdaCL, a Bayesian Optimization-based approach to automatically and efficiently determine the optimal values for those parameters with each learning task. We show that 
 adapting hyperpararmeters on each new task leads to improvement in accuracy, forgetting and memory. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ElifCerenGokYildirim/AdaCL}.

%\section{MISSING PROOFS}

%The supplementary materials may contain detailed proofs of the results that are missing in the main paper.

%\subsection{Proof of Lemma 3}

%\textit{In this section, we present the detailed proof of Lemma 3 and then [ ... ]}

%\section{ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS}

%If you have additional experimental results, you may include them in the supplementary materials.

%\subsection{The Effect of Regularization Parameter}

%\section{NON-TEXTUAL SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL}

%The (optional) non-textual supplementary material (e.g. code for the paper) should be submitted as a separate ZIP file.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Your supplementary material file should be named 642-supp.zip (with 642
%  replaced with your paper ID on CMT).
%\item If you wish to include any code/datasets as part of the supplementary
%  material, you can: (i) include it in the ZIP file of your supplementary
%  material, and/or (ii) provide the public URL where the code can be found in
%  the appropriate field of CMT submission form.  If you promised to release
%  code/datasets (either in the original submission PDF or during the rebuttal),
%  the code/dataset must be released. In this case, the ContinualAI Unconference Chairs will
%  check the availability of the code/dataset and, if it isn’t available by the
%  camera-ready deadline, your submission may be excluded from the conference
%  proceedings.
%\item If you wish to include any **videos** as part of the supplementary material,
%  please do not include them in the ZIP file. Instead, simply provide the
%  public URL where the video is available in the appropriate field of the CMT
%  submission form. NOTE: This does not refer to the recorded presentation
% explaining your paper, which will be submitted/recorded separately, but to any other videos %containing, e.g., experimental results.
%\item Do not include any textual supplementary material in the ZIP file. It must be
%  included in the same PDF as the main paper.

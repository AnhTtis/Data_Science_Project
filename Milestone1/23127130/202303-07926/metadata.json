    "abstract": "Semiring semantics for first-order logic provides a way to trace how facts\nrepresented by a model are used to deduce satisfaction of a formula. Team\nsemantics is a framework for studying logics of dependence and independence in\ndiverse contexts such as databases, quantum mechanics, and statistics by\nextending first-order logic with atoms that describe dependencies between\nvariables. Combining these two, we propose a unifying approach for analysing\nthe concepts of dependence and independence via a novel semiring team\nsemantics, which subsumes all the previously considered variants for\nfirst-order team semantics. In particular, we study the preservation of\nsatisfaction of dependencies and formulae between different semirings. In\naddition we create links to reasoning tasks such as provenance, counting, and\nrepairs.",

    "abstract": "Whirling topological textures play a key role in exotic phases of magnetic materials and offer promise for logic and memory applications. In antiferromagnets, these textures exhibit enhanced stability and faster dynamics with respect to ferromagnetic counterparts, but they are also difficult to study due to their vanishing net magnetic moment. One technique that meets the demand of highly sensitive vectorial magnetic field sensing with negligible backaction is diamond quantum magnetometry. Here, we show that the archetypal antiferromagnet, hematite, hosts a rich tapestry of monopolar, dipolar and quadrupolar emergent magnetic charge distributions. The direct readout of the previously inaccessible vorticity of an antiferromagnetic spin texture provides the crucial connection to its magnetic charge through a duality relation. Our work defines a novel paradigmatic class of magnetic systems to explore two-dimensional monopolar physics, and highlights the transformative role that diamond quantum magnetometry could play in exploring emergent phenomena in quantum materials.",

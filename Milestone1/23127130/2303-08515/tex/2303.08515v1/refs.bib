It allows us to derive a series of new results, as well as make significant improvements in the existing results. First we establish sharp bounds on correlations (including multiple correlations). Then we use our correlation bounds to obtain the central limit theorem (CLT), the almost sure invariance principle (ASIP), the law of iterated logarithms, and integral tests.},

	abstract = {In this thesis we study a number of systems with varying degrees of hyperbolicity, including uniform and non-uniform hyperbolicity, and discuss the calculation of Lyapunov exponents in these cases. We derive and construct explicit, elementary bounds on the Lyapunov exponents of a collection of systems, which are collectively formed via the composition of shear mappings, upon the 2-torus. These bounds utilise the existence of invariant cones in tangent space to restrict the range of vectors considered in the calculations.

The bounds, with appropriate modifications, are (primarily) used to bound the Lyapunov exponents of two types of system in which their explicit calculation is not possible: a random dynamical system formed by choosing at random a hyperbolic toral automorphism, formed via shear composition, at each iterate, and the linked twist map, a deterministic system which has been used to model various physical phenomena in fluid mixing.

Following the derivation of the bounds, we discuss ways in which their accuracy can be improved. These improvements largely focus on finding a way to narrow the invariant cones used in the bounds, by considering possible preceding matrices within the orbit. We also investigate the practicality of the bounds, and how they compare to other bounds and methods of estimation for Lyapunov exponents.},

Explicit formulas for the various bifurcations are included, and a treatment of the Hénon map and the Melnikov method is provided. The dynamical systems approach of the book concentrates on properties of the whole system or subsets of the system rather than individual solutions.

In contrast, mixing processes in aperiodic flows have been considerably less studied. Four procedures are used in this paper to generate well-characterized aperiodic flows. These procedures are applied to the cavity flow and to a two-dimensional mapping with a sinusoidal velocity profile. Mixing in periodic and aperiodic flows is quantitatively compared. Since most of the available analytical tools developed in the context of periodic systems (Poincaré sections, periodic points and their associated manifolds) are poorly suited for the analysis of aperiodic systems, comparisons are based on measures, such as the structure and statistics of the stretching field and the rate of tracer spreading, that apply to both periodic and aperiodic systems. Aperiodicity enhances mixing enormously. Aperiodic perturbations generate widespread chaos under conditions where periodic flows generate minimal or no chaos. The average rate of stretching of material elements can be increased several orders of magnitude in brief intervals corresponding to just 10–20 periods of the periodic flow. The spatial distribution of stretching is much more uniform for aperiodic systems than for periodic ones, and tracers spread much more rapidly and uniformly.},

	abstract = {Much of the recent analysis of chaotic mixing has focused on utilizing tools and techniques imported from dynamical systems theory. However, most techniques require detailed information about the velocity field or fluid motion and are restricted to conditions where the ‘degree of chaos’ is small. Symmetries provide a method of analysis without specific reference to exact mathematical expressions. Symmetry concepts are illustrated in terms of a prototypical system called the eggbeater flow. Although a family of 32 different eggbeater flows can be constructed, symmetry arguments reveal that only four of these are independent. These flows serve to illustrate the role of islands in mixing. If a flow possesses symmetry, islands are found in symmetric arrangements, the simplest cases being reflections and rotational symmetries. A knowledge of symmetries provides the basis for systematic methods for destroying islands. These ideas are developed in terms of the eggbeater flows, and are subsequently extended to a class of three-dimensional continuous throughput flows - duct flows - which are of a more practical interest from an engineering viewpoint. Three such duct flows are studied. Using symmetries, we show that these flows are topologically identical to the eggbeater flows, even though their geometries and flow mechanisms are quite different from the eggbeater flows. Lastly, we demonstrate how the same methodology for destroying islands and enhancing mixing in the eggbeater flows can be applied to duct flows.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys applications of low-dimensional topology to the study of the dynamics of iterated homeomorphisms on surfaces. A unifying theme in the paper is the analysis and application of isotopy stable dynamics, i.e. dynamics that are present in the appropriate sense in every homeomorphism in an isotopy class. The first step in developing this theme is to assign coordinates to periodic orbits. These coordinates record the isotopy, homotopy, or homology class of the corresponding orbit in the suspension flow. The isotopy stable coordinates are then characterized, and it is shown that there is a map in each isotopy class that has just these periodic orbits and no others. Such maps are called dynamically minimal representatives, and they turn out to have strong global isotopy stability properties as maps. The main tool used in these results is the Thurston-Nielsen theory of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms of surfaces. This theory is outlined and then applications of isotopy stability results are given. These results are applied to the class rel a periodic orbit to reach conclusions about the complexity of the dynamics of a given homeomorphism. Another application is via dynamical partial orders, in which a periodic orbit with a given coordinate is said to dominate another when it always implies the existence of the other. Applications to rotation sets are also surveyed.},

For a purely hyperbolic phase space, it is well known that concentration fluctuations converge to an eigenmode of the advection-diffusion operator and decay exponentially with time. We illustrate how the unstable manifold of hyperbolic periodic points dominates the resulting persistent pattern. We show for different physical viscous flows that, in the case of a fully chaotic Poincaré section, parabolic periodic points at the walls lead to slower (algebraic) decay. A persistent pattern, the backbone of which is the unstable manifold of parabolic points, can be observed. However, slow stretching at the wall forbids the rapid propagation of stretched filaments throughout the whole domain, and hence delays the formation of an eigenmode until it is no longer experimentally observable. Inspired by the baker’s map, we introduce a 1D model with a parabolic point that gives a good account of the slow decay observed in experiments. We derive a universal decay law for such systems parametrized by the rate at which a particle approaches the no-slip wall.},

Karl Petersen has written a book which presents the fundamentals of the ergodic theory of point transformations and then several advanced topics which are currently undergoing intense research. By selecting one or more of these topics to focus on, the reader can quickly approach the specialized literature and indeed the frontier of the area of interest. Each of the four basic aspects of ergodic theory - examples, convergence theorems, recurrence properties, and entropy - receives first a basic and then a more advanced, particularized treatment. At the introductory level, the book provides clear and complete discussions of the standard examples, the mean and pointwise ergodic theorems, recurrence, ergodicity, weak mixing, strong mixing, and the fundamentals of entropy. Among the advanced topics are a thorough treatment of maximal functions and their usefulness in ergodic theory, analysis, and probability, an introduction to almost-periodic functions and topological dynamics, a proof of the Jewett-Krieger Theorem, an introduction to multiple recurrence and the Szemeredi-Furstenberg Theorem, and the Keane-Smorodinsky proof of Ornstein's Isomorphism Theorem for Bernoulli shifts. The author's easily-readable style combined with the profusion of exercises and references, summaries, historical remarks, and heuristic discussions make this book useful either as a text for graduate students or self-study, or as a reference work for the initiated.},

We prove that, under some general assumptions, the correlations decay exponentially as n → ∞ for each pair of piecewise Hölder observables f, g ∈ L p (μ) and for each p {\textgreater} 1. As an application, we prove that the autocorrelations of the first return time functions decay exponentially for the induced maps of various billiard systems, which include the semi-dispersing billiards on a rectangle, billiards with cusps, and Bunimovich stadia. These estimates of the decay rates of autocorrelations of the first return time functions for the induced maps have an essential importance in the study of the statistical properties of nonuniformly hyperbolic systems (with singularities).},

In such devices, sample mixing is essentially achieved by enhancing the diffusion effect between the different species flows. Broadly speaking, microfluidic mixing schemes can be categorized as either “active”, where an external energy force is applied to perturb the sample species, or “passive”, where the contact area and contact time of the species samples are increased through specially-designed microchannel configurations. Many mixers have been proposed to facilitate this task over the past 10 years. Accordingly, this paper commences by providing a high level overview of the field of microfluidic mixing devices before describing some of the more significant proposals for active and passive mixers.},

Reciprocating motions merely lead to cycles of mixing and unmixing, so continuous rotation, as used in many technological applications, would appear to be necessary. However, there is another solution: movement of the walls in a cyclical fashion to introduce a geometric phase. We show using journal-bearing flow as a model that such geometric mixing is a general tool for using deformable boundaries that return to the same position to mix fluid at low Reynolds number. We then simulate a biological example: we show that mixing in the stomach functions because of the “belly phase,” peristaltic movement of the walls in a cyclical fashion introduces a geometric phase that avoids unmixing.},

The family can be viewed as the parameter space between two well-known systems, Arnold’s Cat Map and a map due to Cerbelli and Giona, both of which possess finite Markov partitions and straightforward to prove mixing properties. However, no such finite Markov partitions appear to exist for the present family, so establishing mixing properties requires a different approach. In particular, we follow a scheme of Katok and Strelcyn, proving strong mixing properties with respect to the Lebesgue measure on two open parameter spaces.

	abstract = {Invariant manifolds can serve as a geometric template for the study of chaotic advection. In particular, global stable and unstable manifolds of invariant hyperbolic or normally hyperbolic sets form the boundaries of chaotic tangles in physical space, and these manifolds criss-cross one another to form an intricate network of lobes in the tangles. Manifold invariance implies that these lobes of fluid evolve from one to another in a well-defined manner, and it is in the context of lobe dynamics in the tangles that one exploits the invariant manifold template as a skeletal backbone for the study of transport, stretching, and mixing of fluid under chaotic advection, all of which are intimately connected. More concretely, in the study of fluid transport, one can use segments of the invariant manifolds to partition the irregular flow into regions of qualitatively different fluid motion, such as open flow versus closed flow, or different rolls, and then perform a lobe-dynamic study of fluid transport into, and out of, these regions (e.g. entrainment and detrainment) in a geometrically exact context, specified in terms of images and pre-images of a set of turnstile lobes. Mixing can be thought of as a consequence of barrier destruction, and transport across partially destroyed barriers can be studied in a lobe-dynamic context, providing a basic measure of mixing. A practical example of a transport calculation is the use of Melnikov theory to obtain analytical expressions for lobe areas, and hence a measure of flux in the mixing region, which allows for efficient searches through parameter space in order to enhance or diminish a mixing process. The stretching of fluid elements can be studied in the context of the lobes repeatedly stretching, folding, and wrapping around one another in an approximately self-similar manner. Such a picture can be viewed as a generalization of the horseshoe map paradigm for stretching in 2D chaotic tangles, which restricts its interest to a Cantor set near hyperbolic fixed points. A symbolic description of the evolution of lobe boundaries provides a framework for studying the global topology of, and mechanisms for, enhanced stretching in chaotic tangles. In particular, it is found that, though stretching under chaotic flows can be viewed in terms of products of weakly correlated events, there is a range of stretch, spatial, and temporal scales associated with these products, leading to a range of stretch processes. Invariant manifold geometry plays a central role in these stretch processes. For example, the invariant hyperbolic or normally hyperbolic sets have special relevance as engines of good stretching, the turnstile lobes play a fundamental role of re-orienting line elements between each successive pass by the hyperbolic sets, and intersections of stable and unstable manifolds act as partitions between segments of lobe boundaries that experience qualitatively different stretch histories. A notable consequence of the range of scales in the stretch processes is the range of statistics, and hence multifractal properties, associated with the high-stretch tails of finite-time Lyapunov exponent distributions, which has significant impact on interfacial evolution and striation width in the small-scale limit. Regions in physical space of vanishingly small initial measure associated with these tails are thus shown to be able to play a significant role under the flow. The mixing of passive scalars or vectors as a result of such stochastic effects as molecular diffusion or chemical reactions tends to wash out the structure associated with invariant manifolds. However, one can study this interplay between advection and mixing in the context of lobe evolution. In particular, mixing efficiency is seen to depend not only on the stretch experienced by lobe boundaries, but also on the thickness of the lobes, and their separation from other lobes. Though essentially all chaotic advection studies have been in the context of 2D time-periodic velocity fields, we show how an invariant manifold template can apply to quite general circumstances, such as quasiperiodic and indeed aperiodic time dependences, and 3D velocity fields. In all cases, the invariant manifold templates are seen to have physical reality, and the unstable manifolds act as a dominant structure in the regions of irregular flow.},

	abstract = {We present some recurrence results in the context of ergodic theory and dynamical systems. The main focus will be on smooth dynamical systems, in particular, those with some chaotic/hyperbolic behavior. The aim is to compute recurrence rates, limiting distributions of return times, and short returns. We choose to give the full proofs of the results directly related to recurrence, avoiding as much as possible to hide the ideas behind technical details. This drove us to consider as our basic dynamical system a one-dimensional expanding map of the interval. We note, however, that most of the arguments still apply to higher dimensional or less uniform situations, so that most of the statements continue to hold. Some basic notions from the thermodynamic formalism and the dimension theory of dynamical systems will be recalled.},

We derive new, easily checkable, conditions which identify Extreme Value Laws with particular extremal indices. In the dynamical context we prove that the extremal index is associated with periodic behaviour. The analogy of these laws in the context of hitting time statistics, as studied in the authors’ previous works on this topic, is explained and exploited extensively allowing us to prove, for the first time, the existence of hitting time statistics for balls around periodic points. Moreover, for very well behaved systems (uniformly expanding) we completely characterise the extremal behaviour by proving that either we have an extremal index less than 1 at periodic points or equal to 1 at any other point. This theory then also applies directly to general stochastic processes, adding both useful tools to identify the extremal index and giving deeper insight into the periodic behaviour it suggests.},

We analyze quantitatively how the concentration field of a low-diffusivity dye relaxes towards homogeneity, and we observe a slow algebraic decay of the inhomogeneity, at odds with the exponential decay predicted by most previous studies. Visual observations reveal the dominant role of the vessel wall, which strongly influences the concentration field in the entire domain and causes the anomalous scaling. A simplified 1D model supports our experimental results. Quantitative analysis of the concentration pattern leads to scalings for the distributions and the variance of the concentration field consistent with experimental and numerical results.},

We refer to systems possessing all of these properties as nonuniformly chaotic. In this article, we present a globally continuous, piecewise-smooth area-preserving transformation, the toral homeomorphism H, as an archetype of nonuniformly chaotic behavior. The relatively simple structure of point set dynamics and the closed-form knowledge of the pointwise expanding and contracting invariant directions associated with H, permits to derive either analytically, or with arbitrary numerical precision, the standard chaotic properties as well as the dynamics of the physically relevant properties that define nonuniform chaos.

Fundamental differences between spatially periodic and time-periodic duct flows are readily apparent. Steady spatially periodic systems show segregated KAM-tubes coexisting with chaotic advection; such tubes are remarkably stable under a variety of experimental conditions. Time-periodic duct flows lead to complex streakline structures; since regular regions in the cross-sectional flow move through space, a streakline can find itself injected in a regular domain for some time then be trapped in a chaotic region, and so on, leading to ‘intermittent’ behaviour.},

	abstract = {We exploit the connection between the kinematics of mixing and the theory of dynamical systems. The presentation takes the form of a case study of a novel continuous flow mixer—the partitioned-pipe mixer—to exemplify the application of theoretical concepts relating fluid mixing in deterministic chaotic systems. Two general points are stressed: firstly, the complexities that are invariably encountered during the course of analysis limit the detail to which it may be carried out, and secondly, naive analysis based on direct use of the theory may result in misleading conclusions. Starting with an approximate Stokes flow velocity field in the partitioned-pipe mixer, we study the mixing in terms of the flow patterns in the cross-section (Poincaré sections) and their relation to the conventionally used continuous mixing diagnostic, the residence time distribution, as well as to the local specific rate of stretching of material lines and the mixing efficiency. Some of the limitations of each of these methods of characterizing the mixing are exposed; however, together they provide a broad description of the mixing in the partitioned-pipe mixer, and indicate the utility of the theory. The applications of the ideas, within and outside chemical engineering, are many. The most obvious are the mixing of viscous liquids (such as molten polymers), the design of mixing devices for shear sensitive molecules and cells under non-turbulent conditions, prototype models of porous media, enhanced mass transfer devices, etc. Other applications can be expected in geophysics, environmental fluid mechanics, and condensed matter and plasma physics.},

	abstract = {In the Lagrangian representation, the problem of advection of a passive marker particle by a prescribed flow defines a dynamical system. For two-dimensional incompressible flow this system is Hamiltonian and has just one degree of freedom. For unsteady flow the system is non-autonomous and one must in general expect to observe chaotic particle motion. These ideas are developed and subsequently corroborated through the study of a very simple model which provides an idealization of a stirred tank. In the model the fluid is assumed incompressible and inviscid and its motion wholly two-dimensional. The agitator is modelled as a point vortex, which, together with its image(s) in the bounding contour, provides a source of unsteady potential flow. The motion of a particle in this model device is computed numerically. It is shown that the deciding factor for integrable or chaotic particle motion is the nature of the motion of the agitator. With the agitator held at a fixed position, integrable marker motion ensues, and the model device does not stir very efficiently. If, on the other hand, the agitator is moved in such a way that the potential flow is unsteady, chaotic marker motion can be produced. This leads to efficient stirring. A certain case of the general model, for which the differential equations can be integrated for a finite time to produce an explicitly given, invertible, area-preserving mapping, is used for the calculations. The paper contains discussion of several issues that put this regime of chaotic advection in perspective relative to both the subject of turbulent advection and to recent work on critical points in the advection patterns of steady laminar flows. Extensions of the model, and the notion of chaotic advection, to more realistic flow situations are commented upon.},

The aspect ratio of the plate (α) and the dimensionless height of the barrier (β) are chosen as design parameters to conduct a parameter study on the mixing performance. The flow characteristics and mixing performance are analyzed using the cross-sectional velocity vectors, Poincaré section, interface tracking, and the intensity of segregation. The results indicate that several designs of the BPPM significantly enhance the PPM's mixing performance.

	abstract = {Recurrence gives powerful tools to investigate the statistical properties of dynamical systems. We present in this paper some applications of the statistics of first return times to characterize the mixed behavior of dynamical systems in which chaotic and regular motion coexist. Our analysis is local: we take a neighborhood A of a point x and consider the conditional distribution of the points leaving A and for which the first return to A, suitably normalized, is bigger than t. When the measure of A shrinks to zero the distribution converges to the exponential e(-t) for almost any point x, if the system is mixing and the set A is a ball or a cylinder. We consider instead a system, a skew integrable map of the cylinder, which is not ergodic and has zero entropy. This map describes a shear flow and has a local mixing property. We rigorously prove that the statistics of first return is of polynomial type around the fixed points and we generalize around other points with numerical computations. The result could be extended to quasi-integrable area preserving maps such as the standard map for small coupling. We then analyze the distribution of return times in a region which is composed by two invariants subdomains: one with a mixing dynamics and the other with an integrable dynamics given by our shear flow. We show that the statistics of first return in this mixed region is asymptotically given by the exponential law, but this limit is attained by an intermediate regime where exponential and polynomial laws are linearly superposed and weighted by some factors which are proportional to the relative sizes of the chaotic and regular regions. The result on the statistics of first return times for mixed regions in the phase space can provide a basis to analyze such a property for area preserving maps in mixed regions even when a rigorous result is not available. To this end we present numerical investigations on the standard map which confirm the results of the model.},

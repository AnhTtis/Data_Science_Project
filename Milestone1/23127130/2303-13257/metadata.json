    "abstract": "Although reasoning about equations over strings has been extensively studied for several decades, little research has been done for equational reasoning on general clauses over strings. This paper introduces a new superposition calculus with strings and present an equational theorem proving framework for clauses over strings. It provides a saturation procedure for clauses over strings and show that the proposed superposition calculus with contraction rules is refutationally complete. This paper also presents a new decision procedure for word problems over strings w.r.t. a set of conditional equations R over strings if R can be finitely saturated under the proposed inference system.",

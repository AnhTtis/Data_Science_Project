    "abstract": "We introduce a notion of formally étale $\\mathbb{E}_{\\infty}$-coalgebras and show that these admit essentially unique, functorial lifts against square zero extensions of $\\mathbb{E}_{\\infty}$-rings. We use this to construct a spherical Witt vector style functor which exhibits the $\\infty$-category of formally étale connective $\\mathbb{E}_{\\infty}$-coalgebras over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ as a full subcategory of the $\\infty$-category of connective $p$-complete $\\mathbb{E}_{\\infty}$-coalgebras over $\\mathbb{S}_{p}^{\\wedge}$. Finally, we prove that for a finite space $X$ the $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$-homology $C_{\\ast}(X;\\mathbb{F}_{p})$ is a formally étale $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$-coalgebra and hence $(Σ^{\\infty}_{+}X)^{\\wedge}_{p}$ can be recovered as its essentially unique lift to the $p$-completed sphere.",

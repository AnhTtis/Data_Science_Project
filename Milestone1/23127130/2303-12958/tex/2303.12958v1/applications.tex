For this chapter, fix a prime $p$. We first discuss deformations of coalgebras from $\F_{p}$
to the $p$-adic integers and further to the $p$-completed sphere $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$ which leads
us to the question of how coalgebras behave with respect to $p$-completion. We introduce the
notion of a $p$-complete coalgebra and show that this is well behaved with respect to the
deformation theory discussed in the previous chapter. We then use this to iterate
Proposition~\ref{witt} and prove our main results, namely the existence of Witt Vectors
and spherical Witt Vectors for formally \'etale coalgebras. Then we specialize to the case
of homology coalgebras, show that for a finite space $X$ the coalgebra $\F_{p}[X]$ is formally
\'etale, and answer our initial question about the relation between $\S[X]^{\wedge}_{p}$
and $\F_{p}[X]$

\subsection{Coalgebras and $p$-completion}

We have seen that the functors that interest us are all \textit{nilcomplete}. For a nilcomplete
functor $X:\rm{CAlg}^{\rm{cn}} \to \cl{S}$ and a connective $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-ring $R$, we can construct
lifts from $X(\pi_{0}R)$ to $X(R)$ inductively along the Postnikov tower
\[ \dots \to \tau_{\leq2}R \to \tau_{\tau\leq 1}R \to \tau_{\leq0} R =\pi_{0}R.\]
This is however not quite enough to obtain our goal of lifting from $\F_{p}$ to the
$p$-completed sphere, we first need to pass to $\Z_{p}= \pi_{0}\S_{p}^{\wedge}$.
Explicitly, this means constructing lifts against the tower
\[\dots \to \Z/p^{3}\to \Z/p^{2}\to \Z/p\to \F_{p}\]
which is clearly presents a different problem. With the machinery developed thus far, we can already
prove the following for a general deformation problem.

\begin{proposition}\label{liftpgen}
  Let $X: \rm{CAlg}^{\rm{cn}} \to \cl{S}$ be a cohesive functor and $A\in X(\F_{p})$
  such that $T_{X_{A}}\simeq 0$. Then there exists a unique lift of $A$ to a point in
  $\flim_{n}X(\Z/p^{n})$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Set $A_{0}= A$, we inductively construct lifts against the tower of square zero extensions
  \[\dots \to \Z/p^{3} \to \Z/p^{2}\to \F_{p}.\]
  Suppose we have already constructed lifts $A_{k}$ for $k\le n$ for some $n$.
  Applying Proposition~\ref{bc} inductively, we get that
  \[T_{X_{A_{n}}}^{\F_{p}} \simeq T^{\F_{p}}_{X_{A_{0}}} \simeq 0.\]
  Thus, since $\Z/p^{n+1}\to \Z/p^{n}$ is a square zero extension with fiber $\F_{p}$,
  Proposition~\ref{deformations} implies that the fiber
  \[X_{A_{n}}^{\Z/p^{n+1}}=\rm{fib}_{A_{n}}(X(\Z/p^{n+1})\to \Z/p^{n})\]
  is contractible and we find an essentially unique lift $A_{n+1}$. This proves the claim.
\end{proof}
 Of course, for an arbitrary functor $X:\rm{CAlg}^{\rm{cn}} \to \cl{S}$ the natural map
$X\to \flim_{n}X(\Z/p^{n})$ might not be an equivalence, meaning that in this generality
we can only construct pro-$p$ objects of $X$ using this inductive method.
In fact, we have that $\rm{cCAlg}_{\Z_{p}}\neq  \flim_{n} \rm{cCAlg}_{\Z/p^{n}}$. To remedy
this problem we show that this limit admits a description via \textit{$p$-complete} coalgebras.
To do this, we first recall some facts about $p$-complete modules.

\begin{definition}
Let $R$ be an $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-ring, then $M \in \rm{Mod}_{R}$ is called
$p$-\textit{complete} if the limit
\[ \lim \left(\dots \rar{\cdot p} M \rar{\cdot p}M \right)\]
vanishes. We denote the full subcategory spanned by the $p$-complete modules by $(\rm{Mod}_{R})_{p}^{\wedge}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The inclusion $(\rm{Mod}_{R})_{p}^{\wedge} \rari{} \rm{Mod_{R}}$ admits a left adjoint which takes a module $M$
to its \textit{$p$-completion} given by the limit
\[ \lim \left( \dots \to M/p^{2} \to M/p \right).\]
In fact, $M$ is $p$-complete if and only if the natural map $M \to \lim M/p^{n}$ is an equivalence.
This inherits a natural $R^{\wedge}_{p}$-module structure, thus $p$-completion also gives
an equivalence of categories $(\rm{Mod}_{R})^{\wedge}_{p} \simeq (\rm{Mod}_{R^{\wedge}_{p}})^{\wedge}_{p}$ which
allows us to identify these in what follows.\\
The tensor product of $p$-complete modules is in general not $p$-complete. However, the
category $(\rm{Mod}_{R})_{p}^{\wedge}$ admits a symmetric monoidal structure given by the formula
 \[ M \otimes_{(\rm{Mod}_{R})_{p}^{\wedge}} N := ( M \otimes N )^{\wedge}_{p}.\]
 With this monoidal structure the $p$-completion functor $\rm{Mod}_{R}\to (\rm{Mod}_{R})_{p}^{\wedge}$
 is strong monoidal, while the inclusion is only lax monoidal.
\end{remark}

 \begin{definition}
   Let $R$ be an $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-ring. We define the $\infty$-category of $p$-complete
   $R$-coalgebras is given by.
   \[ {(\rm{cCAlg}_{R})}^{\wedge}_{p}:= \rm{cCAlg}({(\rm{Mod}_{R})}^{\wedge}_{p}).\]
 \end{definition}

 \begin{warning}
   Let $R$ be a $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-ring. Notice that by our definition a $p$-complete $R$-coalgebra
   is the same as a $p$-complete $R^{\wedge}_{p}$-coalgebra and so we do not differentiate between
   the two notions.
   However, this is \textit{not} the same as an $R^{\wedge}_{p}$-coalgebra whose underlying
   spectrum is $p$-complete. The process of $p$-completion does refine to a functor
   $\rm{cCAlg}_{R} \to (\rm{cCAlg}_{R^{\wedge}_{p}})^{\wedge}_{p}$,
   but it does not factor through the category $\rm{cCAlg}_{R^{\wedge}_{p}}$.
 \end{warning}

 We now show check that the assignment $R \mapsto \rm{cCAlg}_{R}^{\rm{cn}}$ is subject to the machinery
 of deformation theory.

 \begin{lemma}\label{conil2}
   The following statements hold:
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item   Suppose we have a pullback diagram of connective $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-rings
   \[\begin{tikzcd}
	R\p & S\p \\
	R & S
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
such that the map $\pi_{0}R \to \pi_{0}S$ is surjective. Then the natural map
\[ (\rm{cCAlg}_{R\p}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p} \to (\rm{cCAlg}_{R}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p}\times_{(\rm{cCAlg}_{S}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p}} (\rm{cCAlg}_{S\p}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p}\]
is an equivalence.
     \item For every connective $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-ring $R$, the natural map
           \[ (\rm{cCAlg}_{R}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p} \to\flim_{n} (\rm{cCAlg}_{\tau_{\le n}R}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p}\]
           is an equivalence.
   \end{enumerate}
 \end{lemma}
 \begin{proof}
   Ad 1.: Arguing as in the proof of Proposition~\ref{Mod}, it suffices to show that the
   strong monoidal functor
   \begin{align*}
    (\rm{Mod}_{R\p})^{\wedge}_{p} \to (\rm{Mod}_{R})^{\wedge}_{p}\times_{(\rm{Mod}_{S})^{\wedge}_{p}} (\rm{Mod}_{S\p})^{\wedge}_{p}
   \end{align*}
   is an equivalence. Indeed, given a point $(M,N,h)$ in the pullback, the $R\p$-module $M \times_{M \otimes_{R} S}N$
   is again $p$-complete since $p$-completion commutes with limits. Thus, the inverse functor of
   Proposition~\ref{Mod} also induces a functor on the categories of $p$-complete modules. Moreover,
   we have that
   \[ ((M\times_{M\otimes_{R}S}N)\otimes_{R\p} R)^{\wedge}_{p} \simeq M^{\wedge}_{p} \simeq M\]
   \[ ((M \times_{M\otimes_{R}}N)\otimes_{R\p}S\p)^{\wedge}_{p}\simeq N^{\wedge}_{p} \simeq N,\]
   where the first equivalences hold by Proposition~\ref{Mod}, and the latter since $M$ and $N$ are
   to be $p$-complete. Finally, for $M\in (\rm{Mod}_{R\p})^{\wedge}_{p}$, we compute that
   \[ (M \otimes_{R\p} R)^{\wedge}_{p}\times_{(M \otimes_{R\p} S)^{\wedge}_{p}}(M \otimes_{R\p}S\p)^{\wedge}_{p}
     \simeq \left( M \otimes_{R\p} R \times_{M\otimes_{R\p} S} M \otimes_{R\p} S\p\right)^{\wedge}_{p}
   \simeq M^{\wedge}_{p} \simeq M,\]
 where we have again used the result of Proposition~\ref{Mod} and the fact that $p$-completion commutes
 with limits.\\
 Ad 2: This uses the exact same arguments applied to the equivalence of Corollary~\ref{nilcomplete}.
 \end{proof}

 \begin{corollary}
   For any $n\in \bb{N}$, the functor
   \[ \rm{CAlg}^{\rm{cn}} \to \cl{S} \qquad R \mapsto [(\rm{cCAlg}_{R}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p}]^{\Delta^{n}}\]
   is coherent and nilcomplete.
 \end{corollary}

 We now prove the crucial $p$-completeness result for $\Z_{p}$-modules. As before
 this will enable us to deduce the same result for coalgebras and allow us to tackle the
 actual problem of comparing coalgebras over $\F_{p}$, $\Z_{p}$ and $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$.
\begin{proposition}\label{pcomp}
  Let $\rm{Mod}^{\wedge}_{\Z_p} \subseteq \rm{Mod}_{\Z_{p}}$ denote the full subcategory spanned by the
  $p$-complete $\Z_{p}$-module spectra. Then the natural map
  \[ \rm{Mod}_{\Z_{p}} \to \flim_{n} \rm{Mod}_{\Z/p^{n}} \quad N \mapsto (N\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z/p^{n})\]
  restricts to a strong monoidal equivalence
  \[(\rm{Mod}_{\Z_{p}})^{\wedge}_{p} \simeq \flim_{n}\rm{Mod}_{\Z/p^{n}}. \]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The functor admits a right adjoint which takes $(M_{n})\in \flim_{n}\rm{Mod}_{\Z/p^{n}}$ to the limit
  $\lim_{n}M_{n}$ taken in the category of $\Z_{p}$-modules. Since $p$-complete modules are closed under
  limits, the essential image of this functor is contained in $\rm{Mod}_{\Z_{p}}^{\wedge}$. Moreover,
  if $M\in \rm{Mod}_{\Z_{p}}^{\wedge}$, then we have that
  \[ \flim_{n}(M \otimes_{\Z_{p}} \Z/p^{n}) \simeq \flim_{n} M/p^{n} \simeq M^{\wedge}_{p}\simeq M.\]
  Hence, the counit of the adjunction is an equivalence on $p$-complete modules.
  Conversely, given $(N_{k})\in \flim_{k}\rm{Mod}_{\Z/p^{k}}$ write $N= \lim_{k}N$. We want
  to show that, for every $n$ the natural map
  \[ N \otimes_{\Z_{p}} \Z/p^{n}\rar{\sim}N_{n}\]
  is an equivalence. Since $N \otimes_{\Z_{p}}Z/p^{n}\simeq N/p^{n}$ and limits are exact, we have an equivalence
  \[N \otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z/p^{n}\simeq \lim_{k >n}(N_{k}\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z/p^{n}).\]
  Thus, the unit of the adjunction may be written as
  \[ \lim_{k>n}(N_{k} \otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z/p^{n}) \to \lim_{k>n}(N_{k}\otimes_{\Z/p^{k}}\Z/p^{n})\simeq N_{n}\]
  and so has fiber given by
  \[ F_{n}:=\lim_{k>n}\left(N_{k}\otimes_{\Z/p^{k}}\rm{fib}(\Z/p^{k}\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z/p^{n}\to \Z/p^{n}) \right).\]
  Now we compute the fiber of $\Z/p^{k}\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z/p^{n}\to \Z/p^{n}$ as the module
  \[ \rm{Tor}^{\Z_{p}}(\Z/p^{k}, \Z/p^{n})[1]\simeq \Z/p^{n}[1].\]
  The reduction map $\Z/p^{k}\to \Z/p^{k-1}$ is induced by the map of projective resolutions
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{\Z_p} & {\Z_p} \\
	{\Z_p} & {\Z_p}
	\arrow["{\cdot p^k}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["\id", from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{\cdot p}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{\cdot p^{k-1}}"', from=2-1, to=2-2],
\end{tikzcd}\]
hence, on Tor it induces the multiplication by $p$ map
\[ \Z/p^{n}=\rm{Tor}^{\Z_{p}}(\Z/p^{k}, \Z/p^{n})\rar{\cdot p} \rm{Tor}^{\Z_{p}}(\Z/p^{k-1}, \Z/p^{n}) =\Z/p^{n}.\]
Thus, if we have $k\p > k > n$ such that $k\p -k > n$, the transition map
\[ F_{k\p}=N_{k\p} \otimes \rm{Tor}^{\Z_{p}}(\Z/p^{k}, \Z/p^{n})\to N_{k} \otimes \rm{Tor}^{\Z_{p}}(\Z/p^{k-1}, \Z/p^{n})= F_{k}\]
vanishes since the Tor-groups are $p^{n}$-torsion. Choosing a cofinal subset $S\subseteq \bb{N}_{>n}$ such that
$\abs{k\p -k}> n$ for any distinct $k\p,k\in S$, we see that
\[ \lim_{k>n} F_{k}\simeq \lim_{k\in S} F_{k} \simeq 0 \]
vanishes. Thus, since limits are exact, the map $N \otimes_{\Z_{p}} \Z/p^{n}\rar{\sim}N_{n}$ is an equivalence.\\
To see that the functor $\rm{Mod}_{\Z_{p}}^{\wedge} \to \flim_n \rm{Mod}_{\Z/p^{n}}$ is strong monoidal,
we observe that since cofibers and limits are exact, we have for each $n$ equivalences
\begin{align*}
  (M \otimes_{\Z_{p}} N)^{\wedge}_{p} \otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z/p^{n} &\simeq \lim_{k}(M/p^{k} \otimes_{\Z_{p}}N/p^{k})/p^{n}\\
                                              &\simeq \lim_{k}\left((M/p^{n} \otimes_{\Z_{p}} N/p^{n})\otimes_{Z_{p}}\Z/p^{k}\right) \\
  &\simeq ((N\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z/p^{n}) \otimes_{\Z_{p}} (M \otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z/p^{n}))^{\wedge}_{p}.
\end{align*}
This proves the claim.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{pcomp1}
  We have an equivalence of categories
  \[ (\rm{cCAlg}_{\Z_{p}})_{p}^{\wedge} \rar{\sim} \flim_{n} \rm{cCAlg}_{\Z/p^{n}} \quad A \mapsto (A\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\Z/p^{n})\]
  with inverse taking a system of coalgebras $(B_{n})$ to the limit $\lim_{n}B_{n}$ taken in the
  category of ($p$-complete) $\Z_{p}$-modules, equipped with the induced $p$-complete
  $\Z_{p}$-coalgebra structure.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
This follows from Proposition~\ref{pcomp}, arguing as in the proof of Proposition~\ref{Mod}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{obliftzp}
  Let $X(\blank)= (\rm{cCAlg}_{\blank}^{\rm{cn}})^{\Delta^{0}}$ and $A\in X(\F_{p})$ such that $T_{X_{A}}\simeq 0$.
  Then the space of lifts of $A$ to a $p$-complete $\Z_{p}$-coalgebra is contractible
\end{corollary}
 \begin{proof}
 Combine Proposition~\ref{liftpgen} and Corollary~\ref{pcomp1}.
 \end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{mapliftzp}
  Let $\varphi: B\to A$ be a map of connective, formally \'etale $\F_{p}$-coalgebras. Then the space of
  lifts of $\varphi$ to a map of $p$-complete $\Z_{p}$-coalgebras $B\p \to A\p$ is contractible.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Let $ \cl{X}(\blank)=\rm{cCAlg}_{\blank}^{\rm{cn}}$. By Proposition~\ref{etalchar} the natural map
    \[ T_{\cl{X}^{\Delta^{1}}_{\varphi}} \to T_{\cl{X}^{\Delta^{0}}_{B}}\]
    is an equivalence, but since $B$ is formally \'etale we have $T_{\cl{X}^{\Delta^{0}}_{B}} \simeq 0$.
    Hence, the claim follows by applying Proposition~\ref{liftpgen} to the functor $\cl{X}^{\Delta^{1}}$
    and using Corollary~\ref{pcomp1}.
\end{proof}

Having shown this, we can now construct a functor which is analogous to the classical
Witt-Vectors, which allow us to pass from \'etale $\F_{p}$-algebras to $\Z_{p}$-algebras.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\cl{C}\subseteq (\rm{cCAlg}_{\Z_{p}}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p}$ denote the full subcategory spanned by those
  coalgebras $A$ for which $A\otimes_{\Z_{p}} \F_{p}$ is formally \'etale. Then the base change functor
  \[ \cl{C} \to \rm{cCAlg}_{\F_{p}}^{\rm{cn}, \rm{f\acute{e}t}}  \qquad A \mapsto A\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\F_{p}\]
  is fully faithful and essentially surjective. In particular, the quasi inverse defines a functor
  \[ W_{p}: \rm{cCAlg}_{\F_{p}}^{\rm{cn,f\acute{e}t}} \to (\rm{cCAlg}_{\Z_{p}}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p}\]
  which is fully faithful and satisfies $W_{p}(A)\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\F_{p} \simeq A$ for every connective, formally
  \'etale $\F_{p}$-coalgebra $A$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Combine Corollary~\ref{obliftzp} and Corollary~\ref{mapliftzp}.
\end{proof}

We now turn our attention to the leap from $\Z_{p}$ to $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$. The following proposition shows that,
for an arbitrary cohesive and nilcomplete functor, a $\Z_{p}$-valued point which has vanishing $\F_{p}$-tangent
complex admits a unique lift to a $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$-valued point. This is surprising, as we do not
actually require any information about the $\Z_{p}$-tangent complex, everything is determined by
what happens modulo $p$.

\begin{proposition}\label{spherelift}
  Let $X: \rm{CAlg}^{\rm{cn}} \to \cl{S}$ be a cohesive and nilcomplete functor and let $A \in X(\Z_{p})$
  such that $T_{X_{A\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\F_{p}}}\simeq 0$. Then $A$ admits an essentially unique lift to $X(\S_{p}^{\wedge})$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We inductively construct lifts against the Postnikov Tower
  \[ \dots \to \tau_{\leq2} \S_{p}^{\wedge}  \to \tau_{\leq 1} \S_{p}^{\wedge} \to \tau_{\leq 0} \S_{p}^{\wedge} \simeq \Z_{p}. \]
  Write $A=A_{0},~S_{n}= \tau_{\leq n}\S_{p}^{\wedge},~ M_{n} = \pi_{n}S_{n}$ and assume we have already constructed
  a unique lift $A_{n}$ to $X(S_{n})$. Consider the square zero extension
  \[ M_{n+1}[n+1] \to S_{n+1}\to S_{n}.\]
  Since $M_{n+1} = \pi_{n+1}S_{n+1}$ is concentrated in a single degree, the $S_{n}$-action factors
  through $S_{0}=\Z_{p}$. Moreover, since $\pi_{n+1}S_{n+1}$ is of finite $p$-torsion, the action
  further factors through $\Z/p^{k}$ for some $k\geq 0$. Thus, Proposition~\ref{bc} implies that
  we have an equivalence
  \[ T_{X_{A_{n}}}^{M_{n+1}[n+1]} \simeq \Sigma^{n}T_{X_{A_{n}}}^{M_{n+1}} \simeq T_{X_{A_{n} \otimes_{S_{n}} \Z/p^{k}}}^{M_{n+1}}.\]
  Arguing as in Proposition~\ref{cofib} with respect to the square zero extension
  \[ \F_{p} \to \Z/p^{k}\to \Z/p^{k-1},\]
  we see that we have a cofiber sequence
  \[  T^{M_{n+1}\otimes_{\Z/p^{k}}\F_{p}}_{X_{A_{n} \otimes_{S_{n}} \Z/p^{k-1}}}
    \to T_{X_{A_{n} \otimes_{S_{n}} \Z/p^{k}}}^{M_{n+1}}
    \to T^{M_{n+1}\otimes_{\Z/p^{k}}\Z/p^{{k-1}}}_{X_{A_{n} \otimes_{S_{n}} \Z/p^{k-1}}}.\]
  For the left hand term, Proposition~\ref{bc} gives the equivalence
  \[ T_{X_{A_{n}\otimes_{S_{n}}\Z/p^{k-1}}}^{M_{n+1}\otimes_{\Z/p^{k}}\F_{p}}
    \simeq T_{X_{A \otimes_{\Z_{p}}\F_{p}}}^{{M_{n+1}\otimes_{\Z/p^{k}}\F_{p}}}
    \simeq T_{X_{A\otimes_{\Z_{p}}\F_{p}}}\otimes_{\F_{p}}( M_{n+1}\otimes_{\Z/p^{k}}\F_{p} ) \simeq 0,\]
  where we have used that, since $M_{n+1}$ is finitely generated, the $\F_{p}$-module
  $M_{n+1}\otimes_{\Z/p^{k}}\F_{p}$ is perfect. For the right hand term we
  replace $M_{n+1}$ with $M_{n+1} \otimes_{\Z/p^{k}}\Z/p^{k-1}$ and repeat the argument,
  inductively yielding equivalences
  \[ T^{M_{n+1}}_{X_{A_{n}\otimes_{S_{n}}\Z/p^{k}}}
    \simeq T^{M_{n+1}\otimes_{\Z/p^{k}}\Z/p^{{k-1}}}_{X_{A_{n-1} \otimes_{S_{n-1}} \Z/p^{k-1}}}
  \simeq \cdots \simeq T^{M_{n+1}\otimes_{\Z/p^{k}} \F_{p}}_{X_{A \otimes_{\Z_{p}}\F_{p}}} \simeq 0.\]
In total, this shows that $T_{X_{A_{n}}}^{M_{n+1}[n+1]} \simeq 0$, and hence $A_{n}$ admits an essentially
unique lift to $X(S_{n+1})$. Thus, the fiber over $A$ of the map
\[ X(\S_{p}^{\wedge})\simeq \flim_{n}X(S_{n})\to X( \Z_{p})\]
is contractible and we are done.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{lemma}\label{pcomparison}
    Write $\cl{X}(\blank)=\rm{cCAlg}^{\rm{cn}}_{\blank}$ and $\cl{Y}(\blank)=
    (\rm{cCAlg}^{\rm{cn}}_{\blank})^{\wedge}_{p}$. Then the $p$-completion map $f:\cl{X}\to \cl{X}\p$
    induces an equivalence
    \[ T^{M}_{(\cl{X}^{\Delta^{n}})_{\xi}} \to  T^{M}_{(\cl{Y}^{\Delta^{n}})_{f(\xi)}}\]
        for every $\F_{p}$-module $M$, $n\in \bb{N}$ and $\xi \in \cl{X}(\F_{p})^{\Delta^{n}}$.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    For any $\F_{p}$-algebra $R$ the $p$-completion map gives an equivalence
    $\rm{Mod}_{R}\rar{\sim} (\rm{Mod}_{R})^{\wedge}_{p}$, since multiplication by some power of $p$
    is nullhomotopic over $\F_{p}$. In particular, this applies to the split square zero
    extension $\F_{p}\oplus M$ for any $M \in \rm{Mod}_{\F_{p}}$ and so the natural map
    $\cl{X}(\F_{p}\oplus M) \to \cl{Y}(\F_{p}\oplus M)$ is an equivalence as well.
    Consequently, we also obtain natural equivalences between the fibers
    \[ (\cl{X}^{\Delta^{n}})_{\xi}^{\F_{p}\oplus M} \to  (\cl{Y}^{\Delta^{n}})_{f(\xi_)}^{\F_{p}\oplus M},\]
    which induces the equivalence of spectra
    \[ T^{M}_{(\cl{X}^{\Delta^{n}})_{\xi}} \to  T^{M}_{(\cl{Y}^{\Delta^{n}})_{f(\xi)}}\]
      as claimed.
  \end{proof}

  \begin{corollary}\label{obliftsp}
    Let $X(\blank)=(\rm{cCAlg}^{\rm{cn}}_{\blank})^{\Delta^{0}}$ and $A \in X(\F_{p})$ such that
    $T_{X_{A}}\simeq 0$, then the space of lifts of $A$ to a $p$-complete $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$-coalgebra
    is contractible.
  \end{corollary}

  \begin{proof}
    Write $Y(\blank)= ((\rm{cCAlg}^{\rm{cn}}_{\blank})^{\wedge}_{p})^{\Delta^{0}}$. Then by Lemma~\ref{pcomparison}
    we have an equivalence $T_{X_{A}}\simeq T_{Y_{A}} \simeq 0$. Hence, we can apply Proposition~\ref{obliftzp} to
    obtain an essentially unique lift $A\p\in Y(Z_{p})$. Further applying Proposition~\ref{spherelift}
    to $A\p$ yields our claim.
  \end{proof}
  Thus, we can pointwise lift $\F_{p}$-coalgebras with vanishing tangent complex to $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$. If
  we moreover consider \textit{formally \'etale coalgebras}, we can make this lifting functorial
  in a coalgebraic analogue of the \textit{Spherical Witt Vectors} construction for
  $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-algebras over $\F_{p}$.

\begin{corollary}\label{mapliftsp}
  Let $\varphi:B\to A$ be a map of $\F_{p}$-coalgebras such that $A$ and $B$ are formally \'etale.
  Then the space of lifts of $\varphi$ to a map $\varphi\p: B\p \to A\p$ of $p$-complete
  $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$-coalgebras is contractible.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Let $ \cl{X}(\blank)=\rm{cCAlg}_{\blank}^{\rm{cn}}$ and $\cl{Y}(\blank) =
  (\rm{cCAlg}_{\blank}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p}$. By Proposition~\ref{mapliftzp} the map $\varphi$ admits
  an essentially unique lift to a point $\psi \in \cl{Y}(\Z_{p})^{\Delta^{1}}$. Moreover, Lemma~\ref{pcomparison}
  yields an equivalence $T_{\cl{X}^{\Delta^{1}}_{\varphi}}\simeq T_{\cl{Y}^{\Delta^{1}}_{\varphi}}$. Since both $A$ and $B$ are
  formally \'etale Proposition~\ref{etalchar} gives equivalences
  \[ T_{\cl{X}^{\Delta^{1}}_{\varphi}} \rar{\sim} T_{\cl{X}^{\Delta^{0}}_{B}} \simeq 0\]
  Hence, we can apply Proposition~\ref{spherelift} to the functor $\cl{Y}^{\Delta^{1}}$ and the point
  $\psi \in \cl{Y}^{\Delta^{1}}$, proving the claim.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{wittsp}
  Denote by $\cl{C}\subseteq (\rm{cCAlg}_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p} $ the full subcategory spanned by those
  coalgebras $A$ such that $A\otimes_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}\F_{p}$ is formally \'etale. Then the base change functor
  \[ \cl{C} \to \rm{cCAlg}_{\F_{p}}^{\rm{cn}, \rm{f\acute{e}t}} \qquad A \mapsto A \otimes_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}} \F_{p}\]
  is fully faithful and essentially surjective.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Combine Corollary~\ref{obliftsp} and Corollary~\ref{mapliftsp}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  In the setting of Theorem~\ref{wittsp} the quasi-inverse to $\blank \otimes_{\S^{\wedge}_{p}}\F_{p}$ defines
  a fully faithful functor
  \[ W_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}: \rm{cCAlg}_{\F_{p}}^{\rm{cn}, \rm{f\acute{e}t}}
    \to (\rm{cCAlg}_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}^{\rm{cn}})^{\wedge}_{p}\]
  which satisfies $W_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}(A)\otimes_{\S^{\wedge}_{p}}\F_{p} \simeq A$ for every connective, formally \'etale
  $\F_{p}$-coalgebra $A$. We call $W_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}(A)$ the \textit{spherical Witt vectors} of $A$.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Homology coalgebras}

As observed in Example~\ref{homology}, for every space $X$ and every $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-ring $R$, the
$R$-homology $R[X]$ carries a natural $R$-coalgebra structure, which is a stronger invariant than its
underlying $R$-module. We now want to apply our results and see what can be said about the deformation
theoretic behavior of homology coalgebras. To do this, we first need to compute the cotangent complex of the
$\F_{p}$-cohomology.

\begin{definition}
  A space $X\in \cl{S}$ is called $p$-finite if the following conditions hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The space $X$ is truncated.
    \item The set $\pi_{0}X$ is finite.
    \item For each $n\geq 1$ and $x\in X$, we have that $\pi_{n}(X,x)$ is a finite $p$-group.
  \end{enumerate}
  We denote the full subcategory of $\cl{S}$ spanned by the $p$-finite spaces as $\cl{S}_{p}$ and call
 $\cl{S}^{\vee}_{p} =: \rm{Pro}(\cl{S}_{p})$ the category of $p$-\textit{profinite} spaces.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
We can regard $\cl{S}_{p}^{\vee}$ as the category of ``formal limits'' of $p$-finite spaces $\varprojlim X_{\alpha}$.
As such there is a functor $\cl{S}^{\vee}_{p}\to \cl{S}$ which takes a formal limit to the actual limit in $\cl{S}$.
This functor admits a left adjoint given by $Y \mapsto \flim_{Y_{\alpha} \to Y} Y_{\alpha}$, where the limit runs over all maps
from a $p$-finite space $Y_{\alpha}$ to $Y$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $X$ be a space and $\flim X_{\alpha}$ be its $p$-profinite completion. Then the natural map
  of cohomology rings
  \[ \fcolim \F_{p}^{X_{\alpha}} \to \F_{p}^{X} \]
  is an equivalence.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This is immediate since the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces $K(\F_{p},n)$ are $p$-finite.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Mandell, Lurie]\label{coetal}
  Let $X$ be a space, then the $\F_{p}$-cohomology $\F_{p}^{X}$ is a formally \'etale $\F_{p}$-algebra.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Since the functor $R \mapsto L_{R/\F_{p}}$ commutes with colimits, the claim follows from the fact that
  $L_{\F_{p}^{X}/\F_{p}}\simeq 0$ for every $p$-finite space $X$ which is proven
  in~\cite[][Proposition 2.4.12]{dag8}.
\end{proof}

Thus we obtain the following result about the homology coalgebra of a finite space $X$
with coefficients in a connective $\F_{p}$-algebra $R$:

\begin{corollary}\label{goal}
  Let $X$ be a finite space and $R$ be an $\F_{p}$-algebra, then $R[X]$ is a formally
  \'etale $R$-coalgebra.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  From Proposition~\ref{coetal} we get that
  \[ L_{R^{X}/R}\simeq L_{\F_{p}^{X}/\F_{p}}\otimes_{\F_{p}}R \simeq 0.\]
  Since $X$ is finite, the coalgebra $R[X]$ is dualizable with dual given by $R^{X}$, so the claim
  follows from Proposition~\ref{dualetal}.
\end{proof}

Moreover, for the case $R=\F_{p}$, we can use Theorem~\ref{wittsp} to give a partial answer to our
initial question about lifts of the coalgebra $\F_{p}[X]$.

\begin{corollary}
  Let $X$ be a finite space, then $\F_{p}[X]$ admits a unique lift to a $p$-complete $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$-coalgebra
  given by $W_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}(\F_{p}[X]) \simeq (\S[X])^{\wedge}_{p}$. Moreover, for any other finite space $Y$
  the natural map
  \[\rm{Map}_{(\rm{cCAlg}_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}})^{\wedge}_{p}}((\S[Y])^{\wedge}_{p}, (\S[X])^{\wedge}_{p})
    \to \rm{Map}_{\rm{cCAlg}_{\F_{p}}}(\F_{p}[Y], \F_{p}[X])\]
  is a homotopy equivalence.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
 Combine Corollary~\ref{goal} and Theorem~\ref{wittsp}.
\end{proof}

\section{Where to go from here}

We finish our discussion by explaining some of the shortcomings of our results and sketch a possible
way to proceed towards a coalgebraic analogue of Mandell's Theorem. The first missing puzzle piece is
the cotangent complex of a coalgebra $A$, which we have been unable to give a solid definition of.
The second and more important one is the relation to the \textit{coalgebra Frobenius}. We conjecture
that the class of \textit{perfect} coalgebras defined via this map give examples of non-dualizable
formally \'etale coalgebras. In particular, this conjecture would imply that the $\F_{p}$-homology
of \textit{any} space $X$ is formally \'etale.

\subsection{The cotangent complex of a coalgebra}
One of the first questions that arose during this project turned out to be one of the most subtle and
tricky ones, namely:

\begin{question}
  What is the cotangent complex of a coalgebra $A$?
\end{question}

Clearly, the existence of a single spectrum controlling the deformation theory of $A$ would be immensely
useful. However, it is not immediately clear what the universal property of such a spectrum should be,
i.e.~which space of derivations it should (co)represent.
Some inspiration can be gleamed from Proposition~\ref{cotangentder}. There we had seen that, for
$\varphi: B \to A$ a map of $R$-coalgebras with $A$ dualizable and $M$ an $R$-module, we have an equivalence
\[ \rm{Der}_{\varphi}(B, C_{A}(M)) \simeq \rm{Map}_{A^{\vee}}(L_{A^{\vee}/R}, \varphi^{\vee}_{\pt}\rm{map}_{R}(B, M)).\]
To get rid of the dependence on the second coalgebra $B$ one is tempted to take $B=R$ such that
$\rm{map}_{R}(B,M)\simeq M$. However, not every coalgebra $A$ admits a map $R\to A$, much less a canonical
one. The only natural choice for a map that is not the initial map would yield the following:

\begin{definition}[Preliminary 1.]
  Let $R$ be an $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-ring and $A\in \rm{cCAlg}_{R}$. The cotangent complex of $A$, if it exists,
  is the $R$-module $L_{A}$ corepresenting the functor
  \[ \rm{Mod}_{R}\to \rm{Mod}_{R} \qquad M \mapsto \rm{der}_{\id}(A, C_{A}(M))\]
\end{definition}

There are however several problems with this. Firstly, it is entirely unclear from the definition
whether $L_{A}$ vanishing would actually imply $A$ being formally \'etale. Moreover, in the dualizable
case it would lead to the rather awkward formula
\[ L_{A} \simeq L_{A^{\vee}/R}\otimes_{A^{\vee}}A.\]
Although somewhat plausible, this again gives us little information about what can actually be
deduced in the case that $L_{A}\simeq 0$.
This leaves us with several options, lest we accept that there is no good notion of one singular
cotangent complex. For one we could work with \textit{coaugmented} coalgebras, namely coalgebras
together with a map $R \to A$. For the purpose of understanding homology coalgebras this would correspond
to considering pointed spaces instead of just spaces, an entirely acceptable compromise, but beyond the
scope of this paper. \\
A different  approach would be to give up on the idea of corepresentability
and instead hope for a colimit preserving functor. For example, the functor
\[ \rm{Mod}_{R}\to \rm{Mod}_{R} \qquad M \mapsto C_{A}(M):=\rm{cofib}( A \rar{\eps} \Omega^{\infty}_{A}M).\]
seems to have no chance of preserving limits, but since colimits of coalgebras are formed underlying,
colimits are not out of the race. This leads us to the following idea:

\begin{definition}[Preliminary 2]\label{dream}
  Let $R$ be an $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-ring and $A\in \rm{cCAlg}_{R}$. We say that $A$ admits a cotangent
  complex $L_{A}:= C_{A}(R)$ if the functor $C_{A}(\blank):\rm{Mod}_{R} \to \rm{Mod}_{R}$ commutes
  with colimits. In this case we have $C_{A}(M)\simeq L_{A}\otimes M$ for every $ M \in \rm{Mod}_{R}$
\end{definition}

This definition is highly speculative, as the only coalgebras we know to admit a cotangent complex
in this sense are the formally \'etale coalgebras, for which the functor $C_{\blank}(A)$ is constant.
Conversely, if $A$ admits a cotangent complex then $L_{A}$ vanishes if and only if $A$ is formally
\'etale. Hence, the spectrum $L_{A}$ is precisely the obstruction to $A$ being formally \'etale,
which is the kind of conceptual clarity we are looking for.
While we lose any direct comparison to the cotangent complex of $A^{\vee}$ this is not entirely surprising,
since the property of being formally \'etale is defined very differently for $A^{\vee}$.
This leaves us with the following:

\begin{question}\label{cotangentdream}
  Let $R$ be an $\bb{E}_{\infty}$-ring. Does every $A \in \rm{cCAlg}_{R}$ admit a cotangent complex in the sense
  of Definition~\ref{dream}?
\end{question}

Regardless of the answer, the takeaway should be that the modules
$C_{A}(M)$ are exactly the obstruction towards $A$ being formally \'etale. Moreover, while the functor
$A\mapsto C_{A}(M)$ is very complicated, the dependence on $M$ should be relatively tame. That is,
for fixed $A$ it should be possible to describe the functor $M \mapsto C_{A}(M)$ in terms of a
formula involving $C_{A}(R)$. However, because $C_{A}(M)$ no longer has a direct relation to any
space of derivations or tangent complex, we cannot leverage results like Proposition~\ref{structure}
to obtain such a formula. We understand this as an indication that for these questions, the formalism may
have reached its limit.

\subsection{The Frobenius}
The most lacking thing about our results is the class of coalgebras that we can currently apply them to.
As of now, we are unable to give examples of formally \'etale coalgebras which are not dualizable. In
particular, we cannot describe the deformation theory of $R[X]$ for spaces $X$ which are not finite.
Attempts to reduce to the dualizable case all seem to fail for the following reason: Even though
we may write $X= \fcolim_{i}X_{i}$ where each $X_{i}$ is finite, giving the formula
$R[X]= \fcolim_{i}R[X_{i}]$, there is no reason why the functor
$\Omega^{\infty}_{\blank}(M): \rm{cCAlg}_{R}\to \rm{cCAlg}_{R}$ should commute with colimits.
Indeed, write $f_{M}:R\to R\oplus M$ for inclusion, then by definition
$\Omega^{\infty}_{\blank}(M) = f_{M,!} f^{\pt}_{M}$. The functor $f^{\pt}_{M}$ commutes with colimits,
and from Proposition~\ref{present} and the converse of the adjoint functor theorem we can deduce
that $f_{M,!}$ commutes with $\kappa$-filtered colimits for some regular cardinal $\kappa$. Thus, the class
of formally \'etale coalgebras is closed under $\kappa$-filtered colimits, but $\kappa$ is, in general, not countable.
% Closely related is the fact the notion of compactness is strangely behaved for coalgebras. For example,
% one can show that $\bb{Q}$ is not a compact object of $\rm{cCAlg}_{\Q}$, see~\cite[][Warning 1.2.15.]{ellII}.
% In particular, this means that
% \[ \rm{cSpec}(\fcolim_{i}\S[X_{i}])(\bb{Q})\neq \fcolim_{i}\rm{cSpec}(\S[X_{i}])(\Q),\]
% so we cannot deduce things about the cospectrum of infinite spaces in this way either. \\
This goes to show that the deformation theory of non-dualizable coalgebras is richer and more
interesting than that of the Ind-completion of dualizable coalgebras and requires additional input.
One contender for this additional input is the \textit{Coalgebra Frobenius} constructed by
Nikolaus:

\begin{theorem}[Nikolaus]
  Let $\cl{C} = (\rm{cCAlg}^{\rm{cn}}_{\S^{\wedge}_{p}})^{\wedge}_{p}$, then there exists a natural transformation
  $\psi_{p}:\id_{\cl{C}}\to \id_{\cl{C}}$ which on an object $A\in \cl{C}$ is given by the composition
  \[ \psi_{p}: A \rar{\Delta_{A}^{\otimes p}} (A^{\otimes p})^{hC_{p}} \rar{\rm{can}} (A^{\otimes p})^{tC_{p}} \rar{\sim} A,\]
  where the final map is the inverse of the \textit{Tate Diagonal}, see~\cite[][Theorem III.1.7]{tch}.
\end{theorem}

Given this map, we are naturally led to define \textit{perfect} coalgebras as follows:

\begin{definition}
  We say that $A \in  (\rm{cCAlg}^{\rm{cn}}_{\S^{\wedge}_{p}})^{\wedge}_{p}$ is \textit{perfect} if the coalgebra
  Frobenius $\psi_{p}: A\to A$ is a homotopy equivalence. We denote the full subcategory spanned by
  the perfect coalgebras by $(\rm{cCAlg}^{\rm{cn}}_{\S^{\wedge}_{p}})^{\wedge ,\rm{perf}}_{p} \subseteq
  (\rm{cCAlg}^{\rm{cn}}_{\S^{\wedge}_{p}})^{\wedge}_{p}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{frobchains}
  Let $X$ be any space. Then $(\S[X])^{\wedge}_{p}$ is a perfect coalgebra since we have that
  \[\S[X]^{\wedge}_{p} \simeq (\S_{p}^{\wedge}[\colim_{X}\pt])^{\wedge}_{p} \simeq (\colim_{X} \S_{p}^{\wedge})^{\wedge}_{p}.\]
  On $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$ the map $\psi_{p}$ is necessarily given by the identity, because $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$
  is the terminal $p$-complete $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$-coalgebra. Thus, by naturality $\psi_{p}$ is given
  by the identity on $(\S[X])^{\wedge}_{p}$ as well.
\end{example}

We conjecture that this Frobenius map is related to the deformation theory of coalgebras in a similar
way to the Algebra Frobenius, in that it provides a sufficient condition for a coalgebra to be formally
\'etale.

\begin{conjecture}\label{frobcof}
  Let $A \in (\rm{cCAlg}^{\rm{cn}}_{\S^{\wedge}_{p}})^{\wedge}_{p}$ and write $A\p= A\otimes_{\S^{\wedge}_{p}}\F_{p}$.
  Then for any $M \in \rm{Mod}_{\F_{p}}^{\rm{cn}}$, the coalgebra Frobenius $\psi_p:A\to A$ induces the zero map
  on the $R$-module  $C_{A\p}(M) = \rm{cofib}(A\p \rar{\eta_{A\p}} \Omega^{\infty}_{A}(M))$.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{corollary}
  If Conjecture~\ref{frobcof} holds, then the base change functor
  \[ (\rm{cCAlg}^{\rm{cn}}_{\S^{\wedge}_{p}})^{\wedge ,\rm{perf}}_{p} \to \rm{cCAlg}_{\F_{p}}^{\rm{cn}}
  \qquad A \mapsto A\otimes_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}\F_{p}\]
is fully faithful and factors through the full subcategory
$\rm{cCAlg}_{\F_{p}}^{\rm{cn}, \rm{f\acute{e}t}}\subseteq \rm{cCAlg}_{\F_{p}}^{\rm{cn}}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Since $\psi_{p}:A\rar{\sim} A$ is an equivalence it induces an equivalence on $A\otimes_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}\F_{p}$ and
  thus on $C_{A\otimes_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}\F_{p}}(M)$ as well. However, since it also induces the zero map on the latter
  we get that $C_{A\otimes_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}\F_{p}}(M)\simeq 0$. Thus, $A\otimes_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}\F_{p}$ is formally \'etale and the
  claim follows from Theorem~\ref{wittsp}.
\end{proof}

Combining this with Example~\ref{frobchains} would allow us to fully answer our initial question about
homology coalgebras.

\begin{corollary}\label{dream2}
  If Conjecture~\ref{frobcof} holds, then for any space $X$ the $\F_{p}$-chains $\F_{p}[X]$
  are formally \'etale. In particular $\F_{p}[X]$ admits a unique and functorial lift to a $p$-complete
  $\S_{p}^{\wedge}$-coalgebra given by $\S[X]^{\wedge}_{p}= W_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}(\F_{p}[X])$.
\end{corollary}

The fact that Conjecture~\ref{frobcof} needs to be checked for every connective $\F_{p}$-module should
be understood as an extension of our failure to find a cotangent complex. Indeed, if $\F_{p}[X]$ admits
a cotangent complex in the sense of Definition~\ref{dream}, then to obtain Corollary~\ref{dream2} it
would suffice to show that $\psi_{p}$ induces the zero map on $C_{A\otimes_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}\F_{p}}(\F_{p})
= L_{A\otimes_{\S_{p}^{\wedge}}\F_{p}}$. However, even for this specific module the conjecture is difficult
to attack from our present position. The problem is the tricky right adjoint
$\rm{cCAlg}_{\F_{p}\oplus \F_{p}}\to \rm{cCAlg}_{\F_{p}}$ appearing in the definition of
$C_{A\otimes_{\S^{\wedge}_{p}}\F_{p}}(\F_{p})$. Because there is no known formula for this functor, attempts to verify
the conjecture have thus far been unsuccessful in all non-trivial cases. This warrants further investigation
of the coalgebra Frobenius and Conjecture~\ref{dream2}.

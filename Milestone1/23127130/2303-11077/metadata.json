    "abstract": "Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) is a technique that can be used to implement a polynomial transformation $P(x)$ applied to the eigenvalues of a unitary $U$, essentially implementing the operation $P(U)$, provided that $P$ satisfies some conditions that are easy to satisfy. A rich class of previously known quantum algorithms were shown to be derived or reduced to this technique or one of its extensions. In this work, we show that QSP can be used to tackle a new problem, which we call phase extraction, and that this can be used to provide quantum speed-up for proportional sampling, a problem of interest in machine-learning applications and quantum state preparation. We show that, for certain sampling distributions, our algorithm provides an almost-quadratic speed-up over classical sampling procedures. Then we extend the result by constructing a sequence of algorithms that increasingly relax the dependence on the space of elements to sample.",

    "abstract": "The renormalizable extension of a pure Yang-Mills theory with Lorentz violation is characterized by the CPT-Even $(k_F)_{μνλρ}$ and the CPT-Odd $(k_{AF})_μ$ constant Lorentz coefficients. In this paper, the one-loop structure of the theory up to second order in these Lorentz violating coefficients is studied using the BFM-gauge. Results for the diverse beta functions are derived and contrasted with those given in the literature at first order in these parameters. Special emphasis is putted on the beta function $β(g)$, which is studied in both mass-independent and mass-dependent renormalization schemes. It is found that in a mass-independent scheme the $(k_{AF})_μ$ Lorentz coefficient does not contribute to the $β(g)$ function, but it does in a mass-dependent scheme with contributions that are gauge-dependent and IR divergent.",

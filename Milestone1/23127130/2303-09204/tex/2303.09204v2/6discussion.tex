In light of the results in~\Cref{sec-unequalsplitting}
a clear direction for further research is to 
examine the decidability of the Membership Problem for recurrences whose polynomial coefficients share the same splitting field.  
We recall that previous work \cite{NPSW022} established decidability when the polynomial coefficients split over the rationals.  The present work considers the case when the two polynomials split over the ring of integers of a quadratic field.  In future work we will consider the more general case in which the all roots of the coefficient polynomials have degree at most two. 
As far as the authors are aware, the only known results in this direction are the (un)conditional decidability results for quadratic parameters in~\cite{kenison2022applications}.
Extending the approach of the present paper to the case of polynomials with roots of degree more than two would require new results on large prime divisors on the values of such polynomials, which is an active area of research in number theory.

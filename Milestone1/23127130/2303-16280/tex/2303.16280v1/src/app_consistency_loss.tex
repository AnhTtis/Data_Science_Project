\section{Effects of the Pixel-Wise Consistency Loss}



The main part of the paper compares models trained with two settings of the pixel-wise consistency loss. The \thename model having $\lambda_\text{consist} = 0$ and \thename-C model with $\lambda_\text{consist} = 0.2$. In this section, we show an ablation of the $\lambda_\text{consist}$ values and their effect on the model performance.

\autoref{tab:app_results_lambda_consist} demonstrates the effect of different values of $\lambda_\text{consist}$ on the \thename model realism (as measured by the FID scores) and
pixel-wise faithfulness (as measured by the pixel-wise $L_2$ distance).

As one might expect, the increase in $\lambda_\text{consist}$ is accompanied by an improvement in pixel-wise image faithfulness and a decrease in image
realism. Values of $\lambda_\text{consist}$ below $0.2$ allow one to significantly improve pixel-wise image faithfulness at the expense of a modest loss of image realism. Further increases in $\lambda_\text{consist}$ produce
larger improvements in pixel-wise faithfulness, but also lead to significant decreases in image realism.

Additionally, \autoref{tab:app_results_lambda_consist} demonstrates that the trade-offs of image realism to pixel-wise faithfulness are not uniform across the datasets.
High values of $\lambda_\text{consist}$ allow one to achieve rather large improvements in pixel-wise faithfulness on the \malefemale task at a relatively
small loss of image realism. On the other hand, \catdog translation is subject
to a catastrophic loss of image realism with the increase of $\lambda_\text{consist}$.

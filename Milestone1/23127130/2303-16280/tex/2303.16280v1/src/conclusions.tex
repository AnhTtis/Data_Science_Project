\section{Conclusion}

This work revisited the classic \cyclegan framework and built upon the more recent \uvcgan model. 
We demonstrated that source-driven style modulation and batch statistics aware discriminator are effective techniques to improve the model performance.
Our UVCGANv2 was extensively bench-marked on four datasets on nine translation directions.
Results show that our model can reach outstanding performance in terms of FID scores.
At the same time, we note the absence of the proper faithfulness metric in the area of unpaired
I2I translation, and general inconsistency of the evaluation procedures. We believe developing such a measure and uniformizing evaluation will be highly beneficial for future unpaired I2I methods development.

\noindent\textbf{Potential Negative Social Impact.}
Deep generative models
have potential to be misused for creating fakes~\cite{mirsky2021creation}. 
However, since our models were trained on
public datasets, fakes can
be easily identified with modern tools~\cite{juefei2022countering}.
Furthermore, we open-source our code and models, allowing researchers to develop countermeasures.

\section{Conclusion}

This work revisits the \uvcgan model, built upon the classic \cyclegan architecture.
It demonstrates that source-driven style modulation and batch-statistics-aware discriminator are effective techniques to improve the model performance.
Our \thename has been extensively benchmarked on four datasets with nine translation directions.
Results show our model can achieve superior performance in terms of FID scores.
At the same time, we note the absence of a proper faithfulness metric in the area of unpaired
I2I translation and general inconsistency of the evaluation procedures. As such, developing such a measure and uniformizing evaluation will be highly beneficial for future unpaired I2I methods development.

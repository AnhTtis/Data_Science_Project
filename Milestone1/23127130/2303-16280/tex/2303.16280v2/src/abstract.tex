\begin{abstract}
An unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation technique seeks to find a mapping between
two domains of data in a fully unsupervised manner.
While initial solutions to the I2I problem were provided by generative adversarial neural networks (GANs), diffusion models (DMs) currently hold the state-of-the-art status on the I2I translation benchmarks in terms of Fréchet inception distance (FID).
Yet, DMs suffer from limitations, such as not using data from the source domain during the training or maintaining consistency of the source and translated images
only via simple pixel-wise errors.
This work revisits the classic CycleGAN model and equips it with recent advancements in model architectures and model training procedures.
The resulting revised model significantly outperforms other advanced GAN- and DM-based competitors on a variety of benchmarks.
In the case of \malefemale translation of \celeba, the model achieves more than $40\%$ improvement in FID score compared to the \sota results.
This work also demonstrates the ineffectiveness of the pixel-wise I2I translation faithfulness metrics and suggests their revision.

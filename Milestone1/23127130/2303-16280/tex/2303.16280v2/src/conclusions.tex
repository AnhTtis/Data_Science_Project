\section{Conclusion}

This work revisits the classic \cyclegan framework built upon the more recent \uvcgan model, demonstrating that source-driven style modulation and batch-statistics-aware discriminator are effective techniques to improve the model performance.
Our UVCGANv2 has been extensively benchmarked on four datasets with nine translation directions.
Results show our model can achieve superior performance in terms of FID scores.
At the same time, we note the absence of a proper faithfulness metric in the area of unpaired
I2I translation and general inconsistency of the evaluation procedures. As such, developing such a measure and uniformizing evaluation will be highly beneficial for future unpaired I2I methods development.

\noindent\textbf{Potential Negative Social Impact.}
Deep generative models
may be misused for creating fakes~\cite{mirsky2021creation}. 
However, as our models were trained on
public datasets, fakes can
be easily identified with modern tools~\cite{juefei2022countering}.
Furthermore, our code and models are open source, allowing researchers to develop useful countermeasures.

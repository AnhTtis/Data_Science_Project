    "abstract": "It is now well established theoretically and experimentally that a moiré pattern, due to a rotation of two atomic layers with respect to each other, creates low-energy flat bands. First discovered in twisted bilayer graphene, these new electronic states are at the origin of strong electronic correlations and even of unconventional superconductivity. Twisted bilayers (tb) of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) also exhibit flat bands around their semiconductor gap at small rotation angles. In this paper, we present a DFT study to analyze the effect of the atomic relaxation on the low-energy bands of tb-MoS2 with a rotation angle of 5.09 degrees. We show that in-plane atomic relaxation is not essential here, while out-of-plane relaxation dominates the electronic structure. We propose a simple and efficient atomic model to predict this relaxation.",

\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the benefits of applying various memory optimization methods (MOMs) in different scenarios. By considering distinct application scenarios, we propose to utilize specific evaluation metrics tailored to each scenario. To assess the effectiveness of existing popular MOMs in mainstream frameworks, we conduct experiments using the newly introduced evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate that the application of MOMs does not always yield favorable outcomes. Thus we urge practitioners to exhibit careful judgement and reflect on their use case before applying MOMs.

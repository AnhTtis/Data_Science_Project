	\caption{\textbf{The overall framework of BEVHeight.} First, image-view encoder extracts high-dimensional image features. Then, image features are fed to the HeightNet to generate height distribution and context features, these two are further combined as fused features through an outer product operation. The height-based 2d to 3D projector push the fused features into an wedge-shaped 3D volume features. See \cref{alg:algorithm} for more details. Voxel Pooling splattes the wedge-shape features into an unified Bird's-Eye-View features, which are fed into the detection head to produce the final predictions.

	\caption{\textbf{Empirical analysis of the distance correlation.} All experiments are conducted on the DAIR-V2X-I val set. (a) and (b) reveal the distance correlation between ground truth and predicted distance on the BEVDepth and our BEVHeight. We take distances from the camera's coordinate system origin to the annotated objects' center for consideration. Each point represents an annotated instance. The scatter diagram of BEVHeight in (b) is closer to the diagonal than that of BEVDepth in (a), indicating that the distance error triggered by height estimation is more minimal than the depth candidate.}

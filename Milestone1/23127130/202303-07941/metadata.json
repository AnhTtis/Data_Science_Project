    "abstract": "We consider existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria in an $N$-player game\nof utility maximization under relative performance criteria of multiplicative\nform in complete semimartingale markets. For a large class of players' utility\nfunctions, a general characterization of Nash equilibria for a given initial\nwealth vector is provided in terms of invertibility of a map from\n$\\mathbb{R}^N$ to $\\mathbb{R}^N$. As a consequence of the general theorem, we\nderive existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria for an arbitrary initial\nwealth vector, as well as their convergence, if either (i) players' utility\nfunctions are close to CRRA, or (ii) players' competition weights are small and\nrelative risk aversions are bounded away from infinity.",

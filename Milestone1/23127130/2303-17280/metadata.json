    "abstract": "The work describes a system for converting VLBI observation data using the algorithms of coherent dedispersion and compensation of two-bit signal sampling. Coherent dedispersion is important for processing pulsar observations to obtain the best temporal resolution, while correction for signal sampling makes it possible to get rid of a number of parasitic effects that interfere with the analysis of the diffraction pattern of pulsars. A pipeline has been established that uses the developed converter and the ASC Software Correlator, which will allow reprocessing all archived data of Radioastron pulsar observations and to conduct a search for giant pulses, which requires the best temporal resolution.",

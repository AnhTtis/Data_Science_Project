\section{Conclusion \& Limitation}
We propose a novel velocity modulation algorithm to improve the success rate of prior local navigation algorithms for multiple nonholonomic agents. We observe that local navigation methods can generate yielding behaviors for agents so they can move around each other and continue toward their respective goals. However, yielding requires extra space and can have a low success rate in narrow passages. To alleviate this problem, we propose shifting the POI between two or more agents to large open areas. We show that even using a rough estimation of POI and the required space for yielding, such a strategy can empirically improve the success rate of conventional local navigation algorithms such as GRVO~\cite{bareiss2015generalized} by 100\% in some scenarios. A major issue with the current method is our decentralized setting, which does not allow any communication or coordination between agents. It is thus difficult to further improve the accuracy of POI estimation and shifting. In further works, we are considering extending our method to allow local communications between agents to achieve partial coordination, as has been done in \cite{hildreth2019coordinating}.

%A major issue with the current method is our decentralized setting, which does not allow any communications or coordinations between agents. It is thus difficult to further improve the accuracy of POI estimation and shifting. For example, a POI can be useless if there is a misunderstanding of other agents' intentions, which further introduces unnecessary detours. Moreover, our method cannot provide feasibility guarantees and requires additional user parameters $\eta$ that are not intuitive to decide. We suggest users experiment with different $\eta$ on a row of benchmark problems and pick the $\eta$ leading to the highest success rate. In further works, we are considering extending our method to allow local communications between agents to achieve partial coordination, as has been done in \cite{hildreth2019coordinating}. Machine learning is another avenue to improve the accuracy of future trajectory prediction for other agents as in \cite{ma2019trafficpredict}.

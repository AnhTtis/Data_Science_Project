Deformable image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis and plays a crucial role in a wide range of clinical applications. 
Recently, deep learning-based approaches have been widely studied for deformable medical image registration and achieved promising results. However, existing deep learning image registration techniques do not  theoretically guarantee %diffeomorphic 
topology-preserving transformations. This is a key property to preserve anatomical structures and achieve plausible transformations that can be used in real clinical settings.

We propose a novel framework for deformable image registration. Firstly, we introduce a  novel regulariser based on conformal-invariant properties in a nonlinear elasticity setting.
Our regulariser enforces  the deformation field  to be  smooth, invertible and orientation-preserving. %differentiable.  
More importantly, we strictly guarantee topology preservation yielding to a clinical meaningful registration.  Secondly, 
we boost the performance of our regulariser through coordinate MLPs, where one can view the to-be-registered images as continuously differentiable entities. 
We demonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments, that our framework is able to outperform current techniques for image registration.

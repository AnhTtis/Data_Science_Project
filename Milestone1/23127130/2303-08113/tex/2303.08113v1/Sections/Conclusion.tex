\section{Conclusion}

We proposed a novel %diffeomorphic 
homeomorphic image registration framework. Our main highlight is a novel conformal-invariant regulariser. The benefit of our regulariser is that it yields to homeomorphic transformations enforcing plausible transformations and theoretical guarantees.
Our extensive experiments demonstrated the benefits of our explicit regulariser. Unlike the limited performance reported by implicit regularisation (embedded in a deep network). Future work includes a large cohort evaluation on different imaging modalities.

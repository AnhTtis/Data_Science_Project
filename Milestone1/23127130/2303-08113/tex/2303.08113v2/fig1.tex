\caption{Our proposed workflow framework. We seek to optimise, through a coordinate MLP, the mapping $\mathbf{\Phi}$ to align the coordinates between the source and target images. Our highlight is a new regulariser, whose effect is illustrated in the middle part. Our proposed conformal-invariant hyperelastic regulariser enforces volume presentation, controls changes in length and area, and ensures smoothness of deformation yielding to a better optimisation outcome.}

\section{Introduction}



Recent AI advancements have sparked great interest in AI-based medical diagnostics~\cite{shen2019artificial}, with medical imaging playing a crucial role~\cite{currie2019machine}. However, medical images often contain doctor-added markers that  hinder AI-based lesion detection and classification. It emphasizes the importance to restore images, especially for historical unclean data.

There has been substantial research into robust inpainting methods for image completion~\cite{elharrouss2020image}, including gated convolution-based~\cite{yu2019free}, transformer-based ~\cite{li2022mat}, diffusion-based ~\cite{wang2022zero} methods, \textit{etc}. 
Inpainting also finds extensive applications in medical imaging. Belli et al.~\cite{belli2018context} use adversarial training for chest X-ray image inpainting. IpA-MedGAN ~\cite{armanious2020ipa} performs well for brain MRI inpainting. Rouzrokh et al.~\cite{rouzrokh2022multitask} employ a diffusion model for brain tumor inpainting.

However, these methods often involves manual mask annotation, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig1}, which is inconvenient, time-consuming, and error-prone. 
Blind inpainting methods~\cite{liu2019deep} offer a more practical solution, which is mask-free.
Afonso et al.~\cite{afonso2015blind} present an iterative method based on alternating minimization. 
BICNN~\cite{cai2017blind} learns an end-to-end mapping between corrupted and ground-truth pairs. VC-Net~\cite{wang2020vcnet} performs well against unseen degradation patterns with sequentially connected mask prediction and inpainting networks. However, existing works still have difficulty to localize corrupted regions, leading to sub-optimal solutions in image completion.

\indent In this work, we address the challenging blind inpainting task by creating an efficient network that is mask-free while maintaining high performance. 
Our novel framework includes a two-branch reconstruction network that predicts mask regions and implements inpainting simultaneously, and an object-aware discriminator for enhanced adversarial training. In this way, our end-to-end blind inpainting model can produce reconstructions closely resembling clean images. 


\indent In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: 1) We propose a novel end-to-end blind inpainting network for artificial marker removal in medical images. 2) We design a two-branch mask-free reconstruction network for simultaneously predicting regions of markers and inpainting the corrupted visual contents. 3) We employ the object-aware discrimination by a dense object detector to ensure the restored images closely resemble clean ones. 4) Our method excels over recent blind inpainting methods on three medical image datasets of various modalities with a large margin.

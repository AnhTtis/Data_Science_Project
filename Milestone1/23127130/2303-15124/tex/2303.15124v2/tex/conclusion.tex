\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose a novel blind inpainting method with a mask-free reconstruction network and an object-aware discriminator for artificial marker removal in medical images. 
It eliminates dependency on the technical manual mask input for corrupted regions in an image. And we demonstrate the practicability of employing an dense object detector to the discriminator. We validate our method on multiple medical image datasets such as US, EM, and MRI, verifying its efficiency and robustness for this task. 
For future works, we plan to combine diffusion models in the reconstruction network and validate the performance in large hole blind inpainting.

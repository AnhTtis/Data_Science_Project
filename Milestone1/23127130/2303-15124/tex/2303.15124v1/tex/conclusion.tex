\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose a novel blind inpainting method with a mask-free reconstruction network and an object-aware discriminator for artificial marker removal in medical images. 
It relaxes the restriction of specific mask input for target areas in an image. And it demonstrates the practicability of the application of using dense object detectors as discriminators. We validate our method on multiple medical image datasets such as US, EM, and MRI, which verifies that our method is effective and robust in the blind inpainting task.

\noindent \textbf{Future Works.} For future works, we plan to combine the diffusion models in the reconstruction network to achieve superior performance and validate the performance in large hole blind image inpainting.

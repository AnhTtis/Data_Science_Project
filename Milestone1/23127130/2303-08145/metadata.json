    "abstract": "The widely known relation between stellar mass and gas metallicity (mass-metallicity relation, MZR) in galaxies is often ascribed to the higher capability of more massive systems to retain metals against the action of galactic outflows. In this scenario the stellar mass would simply be an indirect proxy of the dynamical mass or of the gravitational potential. We test this scenario by using a sample of more than one thousand star-forming galaxies from the MaNGA survey for which dynamical masses have been accurately determined. By using three different methods (average dispersion, Partial Correlation Coefficients, Random Forest) we unambiguously find that the gas metallicity depends primarily and fundamentally on the stellar mass. Once the dependence on stellar mass is taken into account, there is little or no dependence on either dynamical mass or gravitational potential (and, if anything, the metallicity dependence on the latter quantities is inverted). Our result indicates that the MZR is not caused by the retention of metals in more massive galaxies. The direct, fundamental dependence of metallicity on stellar mass suggests the much simpler scenario in which the MZR is just a consequence of the stellar mass being proportional to the integral of metals production in the galaxy.",

    "abstract": "Despite consistent advancement in powerful deep learning techniques in recent years, large amounts of training data are still necessary for the models to avoid overfitting. Synthetic datasets using generative adversarial networks (GAN) have recently been generated to overcome this problem. Nevertheless, despite advancements, GAN-based methods are usually hard to train or fail to generate high-quality data samples. In this paper, we propose an environmental sound classification augmentation technique based on the diffusion probabilistic model with DPM-Solver$++$ for fast sampling. In addition, to ensure the quality of the generated spectrograms, we train a top-k selection discriminator on the dataset. According to the experiment results, the synthesized spectrograms have similar features to the original dataset and can significantly increase the classification accuracy of different state-of-the-art models compared with traditional data augmentation techniques.

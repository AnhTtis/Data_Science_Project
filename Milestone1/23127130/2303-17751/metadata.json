    "abstract": "Contract-based design is a method to facilitate modular system design. While there has been substantial progress on the theory of contracts, there has been less progress on scalable algorithms for the algebraic operations in this theory. In this paper, we present: 1) principles to implement a contract-based design tool at scale and 2) Pacti, a tool that can efficiently compute these operations. We then illustrate the use of Pacti in a variety of case studies.",

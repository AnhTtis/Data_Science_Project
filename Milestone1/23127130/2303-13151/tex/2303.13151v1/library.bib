abstract = {Skills and competences of people participating in online professional networks constitute an ever-increasing new source for data collection and analysis. An important sub-domain of human resources management (HRM) is the recruitment process. Job advertisements and people profiles are main parts of recruitment and since are now available online, they constitute a key factor of a new e-recruitment era. Data mining for erecruitment analysis is important in order to extract a knowledge base for people analytics. Skills and competences are the key variables for people analytics and can be drawn from job advertisements. Leveraging the raw information of online job offers, provides a rich source for people analytics. Detecting the appropriate skills and competences for a job from raw text data and associate them with a job seeker is an increasing challenge. The main objective of this paper is the proposal of a framework aiming to collect online job advertisements from a web source which concerns IT job offers and to extract from the raw text the required skills and competences for specific jobs. The selected professional networking web source is StackOverflow and multivariate statistical data analysis was used to test the correlations between skills and competences in the job offers dataset. The present work falls in a relatively new field of research, concerning the competence mining of peopleware data with special focus on software development.},

abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning have stim- ulated widespread interest within the Information Technology sector on integrating AI capabilities into software and services. This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applica- tions. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components — models may be “entangled” in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations.},

abstract = {The present paper has two parts. The first part is a trend analysis from the period 1990– 2004 and the second part is a cross-sectional analysis from the year 2004. In both parts, the purpose was to find the most common technical skills sought in American job advertisements for software developer positions. Unlike in previous researches, also distributed technology skills were analyzed thoroughly because as a consequence of World Wide Web technology, these skills are required now more often than ten years ago. According to the trend analysis, the mean of the number of required technical skills increased from 3.6 to 7.7, and the technical requirements have changed as more versatile. The proportion of distributed technology skills increased very strongly: from 0% in 1990 to 65.1% in 2004. According to the cross-sectional analysis, the top five skills sought in 2004 were Windows, Java, C++, SQL, and Unix. In addition, implications to computer science education are considered.},

abstract = {To participate in software development projects, team members may need to perform different roles and be skilled in diverse methodologies, tools and techniques. However, other skills, usually known as “soft skills” are also necessary. We report the results of a systematic mapping study to identify existing research on soft skills in software engineering and to determine what soft skills are considered relevant to the practice of software engineering. After applying an explicit mapping protocol, 44 papers were finally selected, and 30 main categories of soft skills were identified. At least half of the studies selected mention five skills: communication, teamwork, analytical, organizational, and interpersonal skills. We also identified the data collection methods commonly used for research on this topic: job advertisements and surveys were the main ones. The results of this work are of interest to researchers in human aspects of software engineering, to those responsible for Human Resource in software development companies, and to curriculum designers in careers related to software engineering and development.},

@article{Kennan2006,
abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse job ads as relatively accessible indicators of the knowledge, skills and competencies required of librarians by employers. It then uses a framework provided by the literature on professional jurisdiction to examine what may be trends and shaping factors for the Library and Information Studies (LIS) profession with regard to jurisdiction in a changing information landscape. Design/methodology/approach - Job ads were examined in two separate studies; one comparing job ads in Australia and the USA over eight weeks in 2004, and the other looking at one month snapshots of Australian job ads in 1974, 1984, 1994 and 2004. The text from the job ads was analysed using a content analysis software package. The literature on professional jurisdiction provided an interpretive framework. Findings - The Australian snapshots over time showed that there is an increasing lack of clarity about the skills and competencies required of librarians. The American job ads seemed to rank jurisdictional knowledge and professional qualifications more highly than their Australian counterparts. Interpersonal skills, behavioural characteristics and technical services skills are in demand in both countries. Originality/value - In addition to reporting on the knowledge, skills and competencies required of librarians, by applying an interpretive framework from the literature on professional jurisdiction the paper exposes some of the challenges ahead for the LIS profession. Research limitations/implications - The research used a small number of sources and a relatively small number of ads. It is acknowledged that job ads are only one source of information about knowledge, skills and competencies. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

@article{Saunders2018,
abstract = {Saturation has attained widespread acceptance as a methodological principle in qualitative research. It is commonly taken to indicate that, on the basis of the data that have been collected or analysed hitherto, further data collection and/or analysis are unnecessary. However, there appears to be uncertainty as to how saturation should be conceptualized, and inconsistencies in its use. In this paper, we look to clarify the nature, purposes and uses of saturation, and in doing so add to theoretical debate on the role of saturation across different methodologies. We identify four distinct approaches to saturation, which differ in terms of the extent to which an inductive or a deductive logic is adopted, and the relative emphasis on data collection, data analysis, and theorizing. We explore the purposes saturation might serve in relation to these different approaches, and the implications for how and when saturation will be sought. In examining these issues, we highlight the uncertain logic underlying saturation—as essentially a predictive statement about the unobserved based on the observed, a judgement that, we argue, results in equivocation, and may in part explain the confusion surrounding its use. We conclude that saturation should be operationalized in a way that is consistent with the research question(s), and the theoretical position and analytic framework adopted, but also that there should be some limit to its scope, so as not to risk saturation losing its coherence and potency if its conceptualization and uses are stretched too widely.},

abstract = {Recently, the requirements engineering (RE) community recognized the increasing need for understanding how industry perceives the jobs of requirements engineers and their most important qualifications. This study contributes to the community's research effort on this topic. Based on an analysis of RE job ads in 2015 from the Netherlands' three most popular online IT-job portals, we identified those task and skill related qualifications that employers demand from RE job seekers. We found that the job titles used in industry for the specialists that the RE community calls 'requirements engineers', are 'Product Owner' and 'Analyst', be it Information Analyst, Application Analyst, or Data Analyst. Those professionals supposed to perform RE tasks also take responsibility for additional tasks including quality assurance, realization and deployment, and project management. The most in-demand skills are soft skills: Proficiency in Dutch and English, plus communication and analytical skills. RE is perceived as an occupation for experts, with 23% of all job ads asking explicitly for RE experience and 63% asking for experience similar to RE.},

@article{Gidalevich2019,
abstract = {Research has indicated that students can be taught self-regulated learning (SRL) in scaffolding programs focusing on a fixed continuous practice (e.g., metacognitive question prompts). However, the fading role of scaffolding to prepare autonomous learning is often an overlooked component. A unique approach for fading is suggested that offers a graduated reduction model of scaffolding prompts according to the SRL phases involved in the solution, which allows assimilation of processes to prepare learners for autonomous activity. This quasi-experimental study of fourth-graders (n = 134) examines the effectiveness of metacognitive self-question prompts in a Fixed (continuous) versus Faded (graduated reduction) scaffolds model during planning, monitoring and reflection phases, on the facilitation of students' SRL (metacognition, calibration of confidence judgment, motivation), and sense making of mathematical problem solving at the end of the program (short-term effect) and 3 months later (long-term/lasting effect). Findings indicated that the Faded Group performed best in the metacognition knowledge aspect, motivation in the performance goal approach increased and, in the avoidance, goal decreased. No differences were found between the groups on the regulation aspect and calibration of confidence judgment in the solution success. Additionally, the Faded Group outperformed the Fixed Group on sense making of problem solving. These findings were manifested particularly in the long-term effect. The study supports theoretical claims relating the role of fading scaffolds to increase students' autonomous SRL (metacognition, motivation) and improvements in sense making, particularly on the long-term retention effect.},

abstract = {Collaborative assemblies of robots are promising the next generation of robot applications by ensuring that safe and reliable robots work collectively toward a common goal. To maintain this collaboration and harmony, effective wireless communication technologies are required in order to enable the robots share data and control signals amongst themselves. With the advent of Machine Learning (ML), recent advancements in intelligent techniques for the domain of robot communications have led to improved functionality in robot assemblies, ability to take informed and coordinated decisions, and an overall improvement in efficiency of the entire swarm. This survey is targeted towards a comprehensive study of the convergence of ML and communication for collaborative assemblies of robots operating in the space, on the ground and in underwater environments. We identify the pertinent issues that arise in the case of robot swarms like preventing collisions, keeping connectivity between robots, maintaining the communication quality, and ensuring collaboration between robots. ML techniques that have been applied for improving different criteria such as mobility, connectivity, Quality of Service (QoS) and efficient data collection for energy efficiency are then discussed from the viewpoint of their importance in the case of collaborative robot assemblies. Lastly, the paper also identifies open issues and avenues for future research.},

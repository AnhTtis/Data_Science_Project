    "abstract": "We introduce enriched notions of purity depending on the left class $\\mathcal E$ of a factorization system on the base $\\mathcal V$ of enrichment. Ordinary purity is given by the class of surjective mappings in the category of sets. Under specific assumptions, covering enrichment over quantale-valued metric spaces, $ω$-complete posets, and quasivarieties, we characterize the $(λ,\\mathcal E)$-injectivity classes of locally presentable $\\mathcal V$-categories in terms of closure under a class of limits, $λ$-filtered colimits, and $(λ,\\mathcal E)$-pure subobjects.",

    "abstract": "Given a 3-dimensional CR structure or a path geometry on a surface, its family of chains define a 3-dimensional path geometry. In this article we provide necessary and sufficient conditions that determine whether a path geometry in dimension three arises from chains of a CR 3-manifold or a path geometry on a surface. Moreover, we invariantly characterize 3-dimensional path geometries arising from another family of canonically defined curves for path geometries on surfaces, referred to as dancing paths. We show that chains and dancing paths coincide only in the case of flat path geometries on surfaces. We demonstrate how our characterization can be verified computationally for a given 3-dimensional path geometry and discuss a few examples.",

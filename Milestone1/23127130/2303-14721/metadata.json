    "abstract": "The Geometrical Lemma is a classical result in the theory of (complex) smooth representations of $p$-adic reductive groups, which helps to analyze the parabolic restriction of a parabolically induced representation by providing a filtration whose graded pieces are (smaller) parabolic inductions of parabolic restrictions. In this article, we establish the Geometrical Lemma for the derived category of smooth mod $p$ representations of a $p$-adic reductive group.\n  As an important application we compute higher extension groups between parabolically induced representations, which in a slightly different context had been achieved by Hauseux assuming a conjecture of Emerton concerning the higher ordinary parts functor. We also compute the (cohomology functors of the) left adjoint of derived parabolic induction on principal series and generalized Steinberg representations.",

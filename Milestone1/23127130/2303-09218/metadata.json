    "abstract": "Real Chern insulators have attracted great interest, but so far, their material realization is limited to nonmagnetic crystals and to systems without spin-orbit coupling. Here, we reveal magnetic real Chern insulator (MRCI) state in a recently synthesized metal-organic framework material Co3(HITP)2. Its ground state with in-plane ferromagnetic ordering hosts a nontrivial real Chern number, enabled by the C2zT symmetry and robust against spin-orbit coupling. Distinct from previous nonmagnetic examples, the topological corner zero-modes of MRCI are spin-polarized. Furthermore, under small tensile strains, the material undergoes a topological phase transition from MRCI to a magnetic double-Weyl semimetal phase, via a pseudospin-1 critical state. Similar physics can also be found in closely related materials Mn3(HITP)2 and Fe3(HITP)2, which are also existing. Possible experimental detections and implications of an emerging magnetic flat band in the system are discussed.",

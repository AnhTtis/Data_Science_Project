    "abstract": "This paper presents a study of an integrated satellite-terrestrial network, where Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites are used to provide the backhaul link between base stations (BSs) and the core network. The mobility of LEO satellites raises the challenge of determining the optimal association between LEO satellites, BSs, and users (UEs). The goal is to satisfy the UE demand while ensuring load balance and optimizing the capacity of the serving link between the BS and the LEO satellite. To tackle this complex optimization problem, which involves mixed-integer non-convex programming, we propose an iterative algorithm that leverages approximation and relaxation methods. The proposed solution aims to find the optimal two-tier satellite-BS-UE association, sub-channel assignment, power and bandwidth allocation in the shortest possible time, fulfilling the requirements of the integrated satellite-terrestrial network.",

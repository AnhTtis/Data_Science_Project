  abstract = {The volumetric lattice Boltzmann method (VLBM) has been recently developed and validated for dealing with flows in complex geometries. To reveal the intricate and arbitrary porous media skeleton, VLBM categorizes the computational domain into fluid, solid, and boundary cells by introducing a volumetric parameter P{\dh}!x {\TH}, through which the lattice Boltzmann equations are self-regularized. As a result, the no-slip bounce-back boundary condition at the inter walls is integrated in the streaming term. Since its data structure is aligned and kernel pattern is clear, VLBM is ideally suited for GPU parallelization. Using the P{\dh}!x {\TH} in the streaming operation, branch diverse can be effectively decreased. In this paper, we use several optimization methods, such as memory arrangement and kernel design, to maximize the performance of parallelization for VLBM. As an application, we simulated petroleum flow in a digital sandstone with two resolutions, 2563 and 2562 {\^A} 512, and evaluated its permeability. The best parallel performance reaches 808.7 MLUPS (Million Lattice Updates Per Second), which is 1421.3-times speedup compared with the serial computation with allocated memory.},

Remote rendering incurs increased latency from user interaction to display. For immersive virtual environments, this latency is a bigger problem than for desktop visualization. With hybrid remote visualization we enable the exploration of large-scale remote data sets from immersive virtual environments. This is based on three factors: When appropriate, we enable the local rendering of remote objects. We decouple local interaction from remote rendering as far as possible by depth compositing of remote and local images at a rate independent from remote rendering. Finally, we try to hide this latency by reprojecting 2.5D images for changed viewer positions. In this paper we describe the integration of hybrid remote rendering into the data-parallel visualization system Vistle as well its extension to a distributed system. Thereby arbitrary combinations of object-based and image-based remote visualization become possible.},

Typically, a contact model for these types of simulations comprises a lubrication force for particles in close proximity to another solid object, a normal contact force to prevent particles from overlapping, and a tangential contact force to account for friction. Our model extends the work of previous authors to improve upon the time integration scheme to obtain consistent results for particle-wall collisions. Furthermore, we account for polydisperse spherical particles and introduce new criteria to account for enduring contact, which occurs in many sediment transport situations. This is done without using arbitrary values for physically-defined parameters and by maintaining the full momentum balance of a particle in enduring contact. We validate our model against several test cases for binary particle-wall collisions as well as the collective motion of a sediment bed sheared by a viscous flow, yielding satisfactory agreement with experimental data by various authors.},

  abstract = {Abstract               Alternatives to piled foundations, such as suction caissons, are becoming increasingly viable options for fixed platforms, particularly in the development of marginal fields. Whilst pile design procedures evolved smoothly from onshore experience and theory, design of shallow foundation systems has had to be re-examined in light of the intense offshore loading conditions. This is currently being undertaken through experimental investigations, which indicate the possibility of defining foundation response using plasticity theory.               This paper reports the response of circular foundations on very dense sand within the context of plasticity theory. The load and displacement paths are applied using a sophisticated three degree-of-freedom loading rig, designed specifically to explore plasticity related concepts. The tests are on dry sand to ensure drained behaviour. Eight tests are performed on each sand sample, thus minimising material variations between tests, which is particularly important at the high peak friction angles being explored.               The tests were at 1-g, and concentrate on four embedment ratios (0, 0.16, 0.33 and 0.66) on a sand of 95\% relative density. The research indicates a change in shape of a yield surface with increase in embedment ratio. Whilst the tests concentrate primarily on the plastic deformations, the behaviour within the yield surface is also examined. A conceptual model, based on plasticity, is presented.               The findings of the research are particularly relevant to the offshore industry in the development of shallow and skirted foundations for dense sand deposits.                                Introduction                 Historically, offshore structures for oil and gas production have been anchored to the sea floor by large diameter piles. Recently, a novel foundation type has been used in place of these piles30, best described as upturned buckets, typically 15m diameter and 5m deep, they are usually called suction caissons. These foundations are installed by pumping out water to cause a slight suction to the inside of the caisson, once it has made a sufficient seal within the soil. In the North Sea, where a large part of the seabed is covered by a layer of very dense sand, the suction assists penetration by temporarily reducing the resistance of the sand as well as increasing the net downward force on the caisson.                 Offshore structures are often exposed to severe loading due to wave, current and wind forces. Their foundations are exposed to higher horizontal and moment loading than are encountered onshore. Whilst pile design procedures have evolved from onshore experience and theory, design guidelines for shallow foundation systems, such as suction caissons, have yet to be devised for the intense loading conditions found offshore. In the particular case of suction caissons, there are no precedents in onshore experience, and at present there is little offshore experience, though this is rapidly changing8. This means that there are no accepted procedures, such as the API guidelines for piles, nor are there large amounts of published data available, as firms tend to keep any acquired knowledge in-house so as to gain competitive advantage.                 One of the critical aspects of the design is the ability to resist tension, which may occur under extreme conditions. The important issue is the rate at which the caisson is loaded, compared to the rate of fluid flow within the soil, as the latter affects the soil response. The typical loading on the foundation will be random variations about some mean value, which results in a complex flow regime within the soil, which in turn dominates the response of the foundation. However, it is necessary to define the long-term drained loading limits of},

  abstract = {Abstract               Suction caissons are a relatively new design concept being considered for use as foundations in a wide variety of offshore applications. Unlike many other offshore developments, there is no onshore equivalent of suction caissons to use in the development of design guidelines. This contrasts with the development of offshore piling theory. It is therefore essential to identify key behavioural patterns and important mechanisms that govern capacity under a wide variety of loading regimes. This would allow the establishment of a broad framework of response and thus focus subsequent site or project specific investigations.               This paper is intended to add to this framework by detailing key results from an experimental investigation into the response of the foundation subjected to a variety of cyclic loading regimes. The model tests are conducted at 1g using a complex loading apparatus capable of applying independent control on vertical, horizontal and moment loading at cyclic rates of up to 1Hz. The foundation is embedded in oilsaturated sand in a medium to a very dense state, and the typical period of cycling is such that offshore loading conditions are modelled.               Important areas studied during the testing programme were (i) cyclic loading of the foundation into tension, (ii) cyclic horizontal and moment loading under constant vertical loads, and, (iii) the relationship between cyclic loading and monotonic loading. These experimental results provide powerful insights into load-displacement relationships that could lead to the development of simple analytical or numerical models.                                Introduction                 Offshore structures are subjected to large loads from wind and waves which result in complex loading on the foundation. Wave loading is typically periodic in nature with a dominant period of 15-20 seconds being typical during a large storm. The response of foundations on sand under these loading conditions is best described as partially drained. There is sufficient time during the loading cycle for small amounts of fluid movement and volume change to occur within the soil matrix before the application of the next part of the cycle.                 One of the critical responses of a caisson is considered to be to tensile loading. Large strains may occur before the maximum tensile capacity is mobilised or cavitation of the fluid occurs13. The serviceability of the platform probably requires deformations to be kept much smaller. The performance of caissons under repeated (cyclic) loading of variable amplitude is therefore of vital importance in design.                 The loading on the foundation is usually idealised to the general planar loading condition comprising of \{V, M/2R, H\} components as set out by Butterfield et al1. The drained response of the foundation to this three degree-of-freedom loading has been studied in detail for flat footings8 and caisson footings4. The behaviour of the footing can be encapsulated within a work hardening plasticity theory with the advantage that the footings are represented by a 'macro-model' which may be incorporated within structural analyses5,6.},

  abstract = {Suction caissons are a relatively new design being considered for use as foundations in a wide variety of offshore applications. They are unusual in that, in contrast with the development of offshore piling, there is no onshore experience that can be used as the basis for the development of designs. It is therefore essential to identify key behavioral patterns and mechanisms that govern capacity under a wide variety of loading regimes, particularly those derived from the cyclic wave loading. The object here is to establish a broad framework of response. More detailed work specific to a site or project would be required for detailed design. This paper describes experimental investigations into the vertical loading response of a suction caisson foundation. The experiments are carried out on the laboratory floor using a sophisticated three-degree-of-freedom loading rig. The caissons are embedded in sand saturated with viscous silicon oil so that modeled drainage times are representative of typical offshore conditions. The experiments involve cyclic loading about different mean loads, including cycling into tension and monotonic loading at different rates. The relationship between the cyclic loading and monotonic loading is explored. One of the key conclusions from the results is that serviceability requirements will dictate design rather than capacity. Perhaps surprisingly, for the experiments undertaken, the rate of loading had little effect on the response.},

The capacity is found to be determined principally by the rate of pullout (relative to the permeability of the sand), and by the ambient pore pressure (which determines whether or not the water cavitates beneath the caisson). The calculation procedure depends on first predicting the suction beneath the caisson lid, and then further calculating the tensile load. The method is based on similar principles to a previously published method for suction-assisted caisson installation (Houlsby \& Byrne 2005). In the analysis a number of different cases are identified, and successful comparisons with experimental data are achieved for cases in which the pore water either does or does not cavitate.},

  abstract = {The capacity of open-ended piles strongly depends on the potential plugging occurring during installation. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is particularly suitable to the study of pile plugging, as it can model large soil deformation. However, DEM simulation of the 3D boundary value problems is computationally expensive, and particle upscaling is usually used to reduce the number of particles modelled. In this paper, two granular beds were created with the same average porosity, initial stress field and contact parameters, but different particle scales. Two pile geometries were installed by plain and rotary jacking. Normalised results show that the pile penetration mechanism is strongly affected by the particle scale. Larger particles lead to earlier pile plugging, higher shaft resistance and require a greater force to penetrate the ground. This effect can be linked to a modified penetration mechanism, with larger shear zones and less well defined ``nose cone'' under the pile tip for larger particles. Changing particle scaling has a neutral effect on the total penetration resistance of a rotary jacked pile, but reduces the base penetration and increases the plug resistance. Maximising the ratio of particle scale to wall thickness is key to adequately capturing the pile coring mechanism.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional discrete element model is used to investigate the effect of grain crushing on the tip resistance measured by cone penetration tests (CPT) in calibration chambers. To do that a discrete analogue of pumice sand, a very crushable microporous granular material, is created. The particles of the discrete model are endowed with size-dependent internal porosity and crushing resistance. A simplified Hertz--Mindlin elasto-frictional model is used for contact interaction. The model has 6 material parameters that are calibrated using one oedometer test and analogies with similar geomaterials. The calibration is validated reproducing other element tests. To fill a calibration chamber capable of containing a realistic sized CPT the discrete analogue is up-scaled by a factor of 25. CPT is then performed at two different densities and three different confinement pressures. Cone tip resistance in the crushable material is practically insensitive to initial density, as had been observed in previous physical experiments. The same CPT series is repeated but now particle crushing is disabled. The ratios of cone tip resistance between the two types of simulation are in good agreement with previous experimental comparisons of hard and crushable soils. Microscale exploration of the models indicates that crushing disrupts the buttressing effect of chamber walls on the cone.},

Three types of interparticle interactions are taken into account: (1) long- and (2) short-range hydrodynamic interactions, and (3) solid-solid contact. Long-range interactions are incorporated through an efficient and second-order-accurate immersed boundary method (IBM). Short-range interactions are also partly reproduced by the IBM. However, since the IBM uses a fixed grid, a lubrication model is needed for an interparticle gap width smaller than the grid spacing. The lubrication model is based on asymptotic expansions of analytical solutions for canonical lubrication interactions between spheres in the Stokes regime. Roughness effects are incorporated by making the lubrication correction independent of the gap width for gap widths smaller than {$\sim$}1\% of the particle radius. This correction is applied until the particles reach solid-solid contact. To model solid-solid contact we use a variant of a linear soft-sphere collision model capable of stretching the collision time. This choice is computationally attractive because it allows us to reduce the number of time steps required for integrating the collision force accurately and is physically realistic, provided that the prescribed collision time is much smaller than the characteristic time scale of particle motion. We verified the numerical implementation of our collision model and validated it against several benchmark cases for immersed head-on particle-wall and particle-particle collisions, and oblique particle-wall collisions. The results show good agreement with experimental data.},

A comparison of the predictions of 24 published pressure drop correlations with available experimental data shows that Reichelt's approach (Chem. Ing.

  abstract = {Automatic code generation is frequently used to create implementations of algorithms specifically tuned to particular hardware and application parameters. The code generation process involves the selection of adequate code transformations, tuning parameters, and parallelization strategies. We propose an alternative to time-intensive autotuning, scenario-specific performance models, or black-box machine learning to select the best-performing configuration. This paper identifies the relevant performance-defining mechanisms for memory-intensive GPU applications through a performance model coupled with an analytic hardware metric estimator. This enables a quick exploration of large configuration spaces to identify highly efficient code candidates with high accuracy. We examine the changes of the A100 GPU architecture compared to the predecessor V100 and address the challenges of how to model the data transfer volumes through the new memory hierarchy. We show how our method can be coupled to the ``pystencils'' stencil code generator, which is used to generate kernels for a range-four 3D-25pt stencil and a complex two-phase fluid solver based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method. For both, it delivers a ranking that can be used to select the best-performing candidate. The method is not limited to stencil kernels but can be integrated into any code generator that can generate the required address expressions.},

A multiphase description of the BEP phenomenon is proposed for the numerical solution at the local scale and validated by means of full-scale experimental results available in the literature. Results of the local scale simulations are used as the training set for a multilayer machine learning (ML) model to bridge the information between the local and system scales. Accuracy of the trained ML algorithms is demonstrated by comparing results obtained from detailed physics-based numerical models. The novelty of the proposed methodology lies in its capability of real-time predictions of the overall response at the system scale. A case study is presented where a portion of the Nashville Metro Levee System is analyzed over the span of a year, to assess the likelihood of BEP in the infrastructure. The capability of the model to accept water height data obtained from field measurements is exploited in the numerical simulations.},

  author = {Feichtinger, Christian},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Despite the experience of several decades the numerical simulation of computational fluid dynamics is still an enormously challenging and active research field. Most simulation tasks of scientific and industrial relevance require the modeling of multiple physical effects, complex numerical algorithms, and have to be executed on supercomputers due to their high computational demands. Facing these complexities, the reimplementation of the entire functionality for each simulation task, forced by inflexible, non-maintainable, and non-extendable implementations is not feasible and bound to fail. The requirements to solve the involved research objectives can only be met in an interdisciplinary effort and by a clean and structured software development process leading to usable, maintainable, and efficient software designs on all levels of the resulting software framework. The major scientific contribution of this thesis is the thorough design and implementation of the software framework WaLBerla that is suitable for the simulation of multi-physics simulation tasks centered around the lattice Boltzmann method. The design goal of WaLBerla is to be usable, maintainable, and extendable as well as to enable efficient and scalable implementations on massively parallel supercomputers. In addition, a performance analysis of lattice Boltzmann simulations has been conducted on heterogeneous supercomputers using a MPI, a hybrid, and a heterogeneous parallelization approach and over 1000 GPUs. With the help of a performance model for the communication overhead the parallel performance has been accurately estimated, understood, and optimized. It is shown that WaLBerla introduces no significant performance overhead and that efficient hardware-aware implementations are possible in WaLBerla. Furthermore, the applicability and flexibility of WaLBerla is demonstrated in simulations of particle flows and nano fluids on CPU-GPU clusters. By the successful application of WaLBerla in various simulation tasks, and the analysis of the performance and the software quality with help of quality criteria, it is shown that the design goals of WaLBerla have been fulfilled.},

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamic simulations are in general very compute intensive. Only by parallel simulations on modern supercomputers the computational demands of complex simulation tasks can be satisfied. Facing these computational demands GPUs offer high performance, as they provide the high floating point performance and memory to processor chip bandwidth. To successfully utilize GPU clusters for the daily business of a large community, usable software frameworks must be established on these clusters. The development of such software frameworks is only feasible with maintainable software designs that consider performance as a design objective right from the start. For this work we extend the software design concepts to achieve more efficient and highly scalable multi-GPU parallelization within our software framework waLBerla for multiphysics simulations centered around the lattice Boltzmann method. Our software designs now also support a pure-MPI and a hybrid parallelization approach capable of heterogeneous simulations using CPUs and GPUs in parallel. For the first time weak and strong scaling performance results obtained on the Tsubame 2.0 cluster for more than 1000 GPUs are presented using waLBerla. With the help of a new communication model the parallel efficiency of our implementation is investigated and analyzed in a detailed and structured performance analysis. The suitability of the waLBerla framework for production runs on large GPU clusters is demonstrated. As one possible application we show results of strong scaling experiments for flows through a porous medium.},

  abstract = {A general algorithmic framework is established in this paper for numerical simulations of three-dimensional fluid--particle interaction problems with a large number of moving particles in turbulent flows using a combined lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and discrete element method (DEM). In this approach, the fluid field is solved by the extended three-dimensional LBM with the incorporation of the Smagorinsky turbulence model, while particle interactions are modelled by the DEM. The hydrodynamic interactions between fluid and particles are realized through the extension of an existing two-dimensional fluid--particle hydrodynamic interaction scheme. The main computational aspects comprise the lattice Boltzmann formulation for the solution of fluid flows, the incorporation of a large eddy simulation-based turbulence model within the framework of the three-dimensional LBM for turbulent flows, the moving boundary condition for hydrodynamic interactions between fluid and moving particles, and the discrete element modelling of particle-particle interactions. To assess the solution accuracy of the proposed approach, a much simplified laboratory model of vacuum dredging systems for mineral recovery is employed. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data available. It shows that the overall correspondence between numerical results and experimental measurements is good and thus indicates, to a certain extent, the solution accuracy of the proposed methodology.

  abstract = {A new computational method, the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method, is presented. This method is a combination and utilizes the most desirable features of the lattice Boltzmann and the immersed boundary methods. The method uses a regular Eulerian grid for the flow domain and a Lagrangian grid to follow particles that are contained in the flow field. The rigid body conditions for the fluid and the particles are enforced by a penalty method, which assumes that the particle boundary is deformable with a high stiffness constant. The velocity field of the fluid and particles is solved by adding a force density term into the lattice Boltzmann equation. This novel method preserves the advantages of LBM in tracking a group of particles and, at the same time, provides an alternative and better approach to treating the solid--fluid boundary conditions. The method also solves the problems of fluctuation of the forces and velocities on the particles when the ``bounce-back'' boundary conditions are applied. This method enables one to simulate problems with particle deformation and fluid--structure deformation. Its results are validated by comparison with results from other methods.},

  abstract = {The present paper reports the application of a 2-D coupled fluid-particle simulation model with no macroscopic assumptions to the seepage failure of saturated granular soils. The basic problem of the seepage failure of a horizontal ground with an embedded sheet pile, where the system size is set to be 200 {\texttimes} 100 mm and the average diameter of the soil particle is 550 {$\mu$}m, is numerically investigated. Both the seepage flow and the motion of the soil particles are directly solved by coupling the lattice Boltzmann method and the discrete element method. The goal of this study is to confirm that the 2-D direct simulation can be performed on the scale of a model experiment with soil particles that correspond in size to that of real sand. As a result of the analysis, it is shown that a typical series of behavior for seepage failure, where boiling and heaving initially occur on the downstream side near the sheet pile and finally lead to quicksand, can be seamlessly reproduced. Comparing the cases with different initial void ratios, it is found that the deformation area and the rates of the failure process can be varied according to the packing state. By tracking the velocity of each soil particle, it is visually shown that seepage failure begins to occur in the corner areas of the sheet pile much earlier than the onset of quicksand. By focusing on the fluid force acting on that particle, it is seen that the relatively large values for the hydrodynamic forces are concentrated on the upstream side before the beginning of uplift. In addition, by a comparison with two theories for the critical hydraulic gradient, the current limitations and problems of the proposed method are also summarized.},

An OpenMP parallelized IB-LB code is developed to analyze the performance of different methods in terms of order of accuracy, convergence rate and application of no-slip condition over flow problems like Taylor-Green decaying vortex and flow past stationary square and circular cylinder. It is observed that PSM experienced faster convergence and smoother approximation of no-slip boundary condition in the test cases considered in the present work.},

  abstract = {We develop a two-relaxation-time (TRT) Lattice Boltzmann model for hydrodynamic equations with variable source terms based on equivalent equilibrium functions. A special parametrization of the free relaxation parameter is derived. It controls, in addition to the non-dimensional hydrodynamic numbers, any TRT macroscopic steady solution and governs the spatial discretization of transient flows. In this framework, the multi-reflection approach [16, 18] is generalized and extended for Dirichlet velocity, pressure and mixed (pressure/tangential velocity) boundary conditions. We propose second and third-order accurate boundary schemes and adapt them for corners. The boundary schemes are analyzed for exactness of the parametrization, uniqueness of their steady solutions, support of staggered invariants and for the effective accuracy in case of time dependent boundary conditions and transient flow. When the boundary scheme obeys the parametrization properly, the derived permeability values become independent of the selected viscosity for any porous structure and can be computed efficiently. The linear interpolations [5, 46] are improved with respect to this property.},

  abstract = {Three porous media flow problems, in which the fluid mechanical interactions are critical, are studied in a mesoscopic--microscopic coupling system. In this system, fluid flow in the pore space is explicitly modeled at mesoscopic level by the lattice Boltzmann method, the geometrical representation and the mechanical behavior of the solid skeleton are modeled at microscopic level by the particulate distinct element method (DEM), and the interfacial interaction between the fluid and the solids is resolved by an immersed boundary scheme. In the first benchmark problem, the well-known and frequently utilized Ergun equation is validated in periodic particle and periodic pore models. In the second problem, the upward seepage problem is simulated over three stages: The settlement of the column of sphere under gravity loading is measured to illustrate the accuracy of the DEM scheme; the system is solved to hydrostatic state with pore space filled with fluid, showing that the buoyancy effect is captured correctly in the mesoscopic--microscopic coupling system; then, the flow with constant rate is supplied at the bottom of the column; the swelling of the ground surface and pore pressure development from the numerical simulation are compared with the predictions of the macroscopic consolidation theory. In the third problem, the fluid-flow-induced collapse of a sand arch inside a perforation cavity is tested to illustrate a more practical application of the developed system. Through comparing simulation results with analytical solutions, empirical law and physical laboratory observations, it is demonstrated that the developed lattice Boltzmann--distinct element coupling system is a powerful fundamental research tool for investigating hydromechanical physics in porous media flow.

Among various solid--fluid interaction schemes being proposed for LBM in recent decades, two simple fluid--solid interaction methods---the momentum exchange algorithm (MEA) and the immersed boundary scheme (IBS)---were developed based on the above concept. In this paper, MEA and IBS are implemented in a D2Q9 LBGK system and applied to measure the wall correction factors of drag force upon a stationary circular particle midway in the Poiseuille channel flow at very low Reynolds number and drag coefficients at low to moderate Reynolds numbers. MEA and IBS are also employed to compare the fluid-induced torque over the cylinder in the Taylor--Couette flow, and the steady velocity of a particle settling under the influence of gravity inside a tube. The above experiments show that IBS seems to be more accurate and less demanding on lattice resolution. Copyright ᭧ 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A recent challenge in the modelling of particle flows is to build microstructure-informed drag models to overcome the average description of the fluid--particle force in the drag force correlations currently used in Euler--Lagrange and Euler--Euler models. To that end, we study through particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) the flow past random assemblies of mono-dispersed spherical particles at three particle Reynolds numbers (10, 50, 100) and four solid volume fractions (0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40). The present methodology is validated against theoretical and numerical results for the mean drag force in Stokes flows and finite Reynolds numbers flows. PR-DNS results are then used to characterize in details the statistics of the force distribution over the particle array, highlighting the substantial dispersion of the fluid force along the streamwise and transverse directions. The microstructure formed by the solid phase is described by means of a limited number of tensor quantities inspired from the fabric tensor used in granular media. Significant correlations are identified between the force experienced by a given particle immersed in a random array and a few key quantities that describe the anisotropy of its neighbourhood. A microstructure-based multi-linear model is proposed and validated against independent test cases. The model appears to perform best in the viscous and dense regimes. The addition of a stochastic contribution to the model allows to recover the correct level of force fluctuations at the cost of a lower correlation between the model and the data.},

  abstract = {Particle-fluid flows with free-surfaces are commonly encountered in many industrial processes, such as wet ball milling, slurry transport and mixing. Accurate prediction of particle behaviors in these systems is critical to establish fundamental understandings of the processes, however the presence of the free-surface makes modelling them a challenge for most traditional, continuum, multi-phase methodologies. Coupling of smoothed particle hydrodynamics and discrete element method (SPH-DEM) has the potential to be an effective numerical method to achieve this goal. However, practical application of this method remains challenging due to high computational demands. In this work, a general purposed SPH-DEM model that runs entirely on a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) is developed to accelerate the simulation. Fluid-solid coupling is based on local averaging techniques and, to accelerate neighbor searching, a dual-grid searching approach is adapted to a GPU architecture to tackle the size difference in the searching area between SPH and DEM. Simulation results compare well with experimental results on dam-breaking of a free-surface flow and particle-fluid flow both qualitatively and quantitatively, confirming the validity of the developed model. More than 10 million fluid particles can be simulated on a single GPU using double-precision floating point operations. A linear scalability of calculation time with the number of particles is obtained for both single-phase and two-phase flows. Practical application of the developed model is demonstrated by simulations of an agitated tubular reactor and a rotating drum, showing its capability in handling complex engineering problems involving both free-surfaces and particle-fluid interactions.},

It is based on a new, concise calculus for describing multiple relaxation-time LBMs, including techniques that enable the numerically advantageous subtraction of the constant background component from the populations. These techniques are generalized to a wide range of collision spaces and equilibrium distributions. The article contains an overview of lbmpy's frontend and its code generation pipeline, which implements the new LBM calculus by means of symbolic formula manipulation tools and object-oriented programming. The generated codes have only a minimal number of arithmetic operations. Their automatic derivation rests on two novel chimera transforms that have been specifically developed for efficiently computing raw and central moments. Information contained in the symbolic representation of the methods is further exploited in a customized sequence of algebraic simplifications, further reducing computational cost. When combined, these algebraic transformations lead to concise and compact numerical kernels. Specifically, with these optimizations, the advanced central moment- and cumulant-based methods can be realized with only little additional cost as when compared with the simple Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook method. The effectiveness and flexibility of the new lbmpy code generation system is demonstrated in simulating Taylor--Green vortex decay and the automatic derivation of an LBM algorithm to solve the shallow water equations.},

  abstract = {This study develops a computationally efficient phase-field lattice Boltzmann (LB) model with the capability to simulate thermocapillary flows. The model was implemented into the open-source simulation framework, waLBerla, and extended to conduct the collision stage using central moments. The multiphase model was coupled with both a passive-scalar thermal LB, and a Runge-Kutta (RK) solution to the energy equation in order to resolve temperature-dependent surface tension phenomena. Various lattice stencils (D3Q7, D3Q15, D3Q19, D3Q27) were tested for the passive-scalar LB and both the second- and fourthorder RK methods were investigated. There was no significant difference observed in the accuracy of the LB or RK schemes. The passive scalar D3Q7 LB discretisation tended to provide computational benefits, while the second order RK scheme is superior in memory usage. This paper makes contributions relating to the modelling of thermocapillary flows and to understanding the behaviour of droplet capture with thermal sources analogous to thermal tweezers. Four primary contributions to the literature are identified. First, a new 3D thermocapillary, central-moment phase-field LB model is presented and implemented in the open-source software, waLBerla. Second, the accuracy and computational performance of various techniques to resolve the energy equation for multiphase, incompressible fluids is investigated. Third, the dynamic droplet transport behaviour in the presence of thermal sources is studied and insight is provided on the potential ability to manipulate droplets based on local domain heating. Finally, a concise analysis of the computational performance together with near-perfect scaling results on NVIDIA and AMD GPU-clusters is shown. This research enables the detailed study of droplet manipulation and control in thermocapillary devices by providing a highly-efficient computational modelling methodology.},

Records are presented for suction installation of the caissons, cyclic moment loading under both quasi-static and dynamic conditions to simulate the behaviour of a monopod foundation, and cyclic vertical loading and pullout of caissons to simulate one footing in a quadruped foundation. Variations of stiffness with loading level of the foundation are observed, with high initial stiffness followed by hysteretic behaviour at moderate loads and degradation of response at high loads. Some implications for the design of wind turbine foundations are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Suction caissons have proven to be economical and easy to install for anchoring deepwater offshore structures with taut or semi-taut moorings, such as FPSOs (Floating Production Storage Offloading), SPARs, FPSs (Floating Production Systems), etc. However, due to the complex loading conditions and paucity of model test database, the design of suction caissons is still in the state-of-the-art phase, and no industry consensus has been reached. Unlike traditional driven piles, suction caissons are different in many ways, such as the installation methods and load-resisting mechanisms. This paper systematically discusses the geotechnical design of suction caissons installed in clay stratigraphies. Many important aspects and factors involved in suction caisson design, such as set-up effects, soil failure modes, padeye location optimization, axial capacities estimation, cyclic loading and sustained load effects, etc. are brought up for discussion. Limit equilibrium methods are used as an effective way to estimate suction caisson capacity and caisson penetration/removal parameters as well. Beam-column and Finite Element Analyses are more advanced methods to better understand caisson load-displacement behavior and verify load capacity derived from the limit equilibrium methods. Finally, suggestions for future research are given on how to clarify the uncertainties associated with current suction caisson designs.},

Therefore, this study utilized a resolved coupling method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM) to investigate the fluid-solid interaction and its underlying meso mechanics within the granul{\"a}r soils. Three representative cases including single particle free setting, seepage in narrow tubes with dense-packed particles, and one-dimensional consolidation of particle column were implemented to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the resolved CFD-DEM in granul{\"a}r soils. Moreover, the influence of the mesh size and timestep were evaluated in dilute and dense particle Systems, respectively. All the numerical results indicated well agreement with the experimental or analytical results reported in literatures. Furthermore, the nonlinear behaviours of the fluid-solid interaction (e.g., wake flow and wall effect) and authentic characteristics at pore scale level were ftilly depicted in this study. These novel findings provided a deep insight into the meso-mechanics of the complicated fluid-solid interaction within saturated granul{\"a}r soils.},

Therefore the numerical simulation has gained an increasing importance to gain deeper insight into the properties of granular media. One simulation approach is rigid body dynamics. In contrast to particle-based approaches, it fully resolves the granular particles as geometric objects and incorporates frictional contact dynamics. However, due to its complexity and the lack of large-scale parallelization, rigid body dynamics so far could not be used for very large simulation scenarios. In this paper we demonstrate massively parallel granular media simulations by means of a parallel rigid body dynamics algorithm. We will validate the algorithm for granular gas simulations and prove its scalability on up to 131 072 processor cores. Additionally, we will show several parallel granular material simulations both with spherical and nonspherical granular particles.},

In DEM, the individual interaction forces between particles are treated on a particle--particle pair basis, and therefore, this method is computational expensive. In addition, the CFD-calculation of the fluid flow increases the computational effort. Thus, current CFD--DEM simulations are limited to systems with particle numbers not exceeding 105. In order to simulate realistic systems, the recently available Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) technology can be applied, which can perform massively-parallel DEM-simulations with several million particles on a single desk-side Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The objective of this work is to present a new hybrid approach to solve CFD--DEM problems in gas--solid fluidized beds systems applying an efficient coupling method suitable for large-scale simulations. We are using the CUDA technology for the particle simulation and introducing a coupling methodology with a commercial CFD-code. The coupling method between a CFD-code, running on the CPU and our CUDA-based DEM-code running on the GPU, is introduced and discussed. The numerical results are compared to the CFD--DEM and the experimental results of Van Buijtenen et al. (2011). A good agreement was achieved. Finally, fluidized system simulations with up to 25 million particles are presented, which is an unprecented number.},

This unique definition necessitates a topology based neighbor search as a preprocessing step, but also enables parallel implementation. More specifically, normal vectors of adjacent triangular tessellations are used to construct half-angles that clearly separate the per-triangle regions. For each triangle, the grid nodes inside the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) are tested for their distance to the triangle in question and for certain well-defined relative angles. The performance of the presented grid generation procedure is superior to the performance of the GPU-accelerated flow field computations per time step which allows efficient fluid-structure interaction simulations, without noticeable performance loss due to the dynamic grid update.},

In multiphysics simulations, the various combined methodologies may have distinctly different computational characteristics. Therefore, the best-suited hardware architecture can differ between the simulation components. Furthermore, not all coupled software frameworks may support all hardware. These issues predestinate or even force hybrid implementations, i.e., different simulation components running on different hardware. We introduce a hybrid coupled fluid-particle implementation with geometrically resolved particles. The simulation utilizes GPUs for the fluid dynamics, whereas the particle simulation runs on Central Processing Unit (CPU)s. We examine the performance of two contrasting cases of a fluidized bed simulation on a heterogeneous supercomputer. The hybrid overhead (i.e., the CPU-GPU communication) is negligible. The fluid simulation shows good performance utilizing nearly the entire memory bandwidth. Still, the GPU run time accounts for most of the total time. The parallel efficiency in a weak scaling benchmark for 1024 A100 GPUs is up to 71\%. Frequent CPU-CPU communications occurring in the particle simulation are the leading cause of the decrease in parallel efficiency. The results show that hybrid implementations are promising for large-scale multiphysics simulations on heterogeneous supercomputers.},

An Euler-Lagrangian coupling employs momentum exchange between the fluid phase and the geometrically resolved particles. We investigate the behavior of the soil for three cases with varying prescribed suction velocities. We observe piping in the case with the highest suction velocity by analyzing the deformation of the granular fabric and monitoring the differential pressure. The grains under the bucket wall-tip show the highest hydraulic gradients and forces at the onset of piping. This approach permits a detailed analysis of piping phenomena and brings novel insights on the triggering conditions for piping failure of suction-aided foundations.},

To draw attention to overall system balance, in this paper, we analyze balance ratios and architectural trends in the world's most powerful supercomputers.

Notably, our analysis studies the performance balance of the machines, across a variety of subsystems such as compute, memory, I/O, interconnect, intra-node connectivity and power.

Two parameter points in the laminar flow regime are chosen, leading to the emergence of sediment patterns classified as `small dunes', while one case under turbulent flow conditions leads to `vortex dunes' with significant flow separation on the lee side. The wavelength, amplitude and propagation speed of the patterns extracted from the spanwise-averaged fluid--bed interface are found to be consistent with available experimental data.

It is usually caused by the upward seepage flow created by continuous pumping out of water from inside the bucket as well as due to shear failure of the soil along the skirt wall during skirt penetration. This soil-plug heave eventually hinders the bucket to be installed at a targeted depth and hence affects its performance. This paper, therefore, presents the result of a series of bucket installation tests using half-bucket foundation performed in a box equipped with a transparent window for directly observing the soil movement around the bucket during installation. Continuous images were captured simultaneously during the entire suction installation process and subsequently analysed by particle image velocimetry to quantify the soil movement. The results provide: (a) the trend of suction pressure with wall embedment; (b) soil-displacement pattern and (c) the effects of penetration rate (i.e. water-pumping rate) and wall thickness on the soil displacement. The results also provide comprehensive insights into the mechanism of soil disturbance, including soil-heave formation, during suction installation.},

SnuCL provides a system image running a single operating system instance for heterogeneous CPU/GPU clusters to the user. It allows the application to utilize compute devices in a compute node as if they were in the host node. No communication API, such as the MPI library, is required in the application source. SnuCL also provides collective communication extensions to OpenCL to facilitate manipulating memory objects. With SnuCL, an OpenCL application becomes portable not only between heterogeneous devices in a single node, but also between compute devices in the cluster environment. We implement SnuCL and evaluate its performance using eleven OpenCL benchmark applications.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of the pore-scale intergranular flow analysis by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), with the aid of the discrete element method (DEM), is investigated and compared with the experimental results of saturated seepage flows. Due to its simplicity and computational efficiency, a regularized Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model is employed for the LBM to increase the numerical stability. After examining the performance of the numerical method by two well-known problems, namely the Hagen-Poiseuille flow and the flow past a stationary single sphere, a pore-scale numerical simulation of the saturated seepage flow is conducted. Permeability tests are carried out with an artificial porous medium prepared by a 3D printer, consisting of a sufficient number of resin particles. The experimental results are compared with those of the LBM numerical simulation, in which the pore structure of the porous medium is reproduced by the DEM. The numerical results are seen to have properly predicted the macroscopic properties obtained by the permeability tests, which have shown the prominent applicability of the LBM-DEM analysis to pore-scale intergranular fluid flows.},

The tool couples the lattice Boltzmann solver Palabos for the simulation of blood plasma, a novel finite-element method (FEM) solver for the resolution of deformable blood cells, and an immersed boundary method for the coupling of the two phases. The design of the tool supports hybrid CPU--GPU executions (fluid, fluid--solid interaction on CPUs, deformable bodies on GPUs), and is non-intrusive, as each of the three components can be replaced in a modular way. The FEM-based kernel for solid dynamics outperforms other FEM solvers and its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art mass--spring systems. We perform an exhaustive performance analysis on Piz Daint at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre and provide case studies focused on platelet transport, implicitly validating the accuracy of our tool. The tests show that this versatile framework combines unprecedented accuracy with massive performance, rendering it suitable for upcoming exascale architectures.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews applications of the lattice-Boltzmann method to simulations of particle-fluid suspensions. We first summarize the available simulation methods for colloidal suspensions together with some of the important applications of these methods, and then describe results from lattice-gas and lattice-Boltzmann simulations in more detail. The remainder of the paper is an update of previously published work,(69, 70) taking into account recent research by ourselves and other groups. We describe a lattice-Boltzmann model that can take proper account of density fluctuations in the fluid, which may be important in describing the short-time dynamics of colloidal particles. We then derive macro-dynamical equations for a collision operator with separate shear and bulk viscosities, via the usual multi-time-scale expansion. A careful examination of the second-order equations shows that inclusion of an external force, such as a pressure gradient, requires terms that depend on the eigenvalues of the collision operator. Alternatively, the momentum density must be redefined to include a contribution from the external force. Next, we summarize recent innovations and give a few numerical examples to illustrate critical issues. Finally, we derive the equations for a lattice-Boltzmann model that includes transverse and longitudinal fluctuations in momentum. The model leads to a discrete version of the Green--Kubo relations for the shear and bulk viscosity, which agree with the viscosities obtained from the macro-dynamical analysis. We believe that inclusion of longitudinal fluctuations will improve the equipartition of energy in lattice-Boltzmann simulations of colloidal suspensions.},

  abstract = {An efficient computing framework, namely PFlows, for fully resolved-direct numerical simulations of particle-laden flows was accelerated on NVIDIA General Processing Units (GPUs) and GPU-like accelerator (DCU) cards. The framework is featured as coupling the lattice Boltzmann method for fluid flow with the immersed boundary method for fluid-particle interaction, and the discrete element method for particle collision, using two fixed Eulerian meshes and one moved Lagrangian point mesh, respectively. All the parts are accelerated by a fine-grained parallelism technique using CUDA on GPUs, and further using HIP on DCU cards, i.e., the calculation on each fluid grid, each immersed boundary point, each particle motion, and each pair-particle collision is responsible by one computer thread, respectively. Coalesced memory accesses to LBM distribution functions with the data layout of Structure of Arrays are used to maximize utilization of hardware bandwidth. Parallel reduction with shared memory for data of immersed boundary points is adopted for the sake of reducing access to global memory when integrate particle hydrodynamic force. MPI computing is further used for computing on heterogeneous architectures with multiple CPUs-GPUs/DCUs. The communications between adjacent processors are hidden by overlapping with calculations. Two benchmark cases were conducted for code validation, including a pure fluid flow and a particle-laden flow. The performances on a single accelerator show that a GPU V100 can achieve 7.1e11.1 times speed up, while a single DCU can achieve 5.6e8.8 times speed up compared to a single Xeon CPU chip (32 cores). The performances on multi-accelerators show that parallel efficiency is 0.5e0.8 for weak scaling and 0.68e0.9 for strong scaling on up to 64 DCU cards even for the dense flow (4 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20\%). The peak performance reaches 179 giga lattice updates per second (GLUPS) on 256 DCU cards by using 1 billion grids and 1 million particles. At last, a large-scale simulation of a gas-solid flow with 1.6 billion grids and 1.6 million particles was conducted using only 32 DCU cards. This simulation shows that the present framework is prospective for simulations of large-scale particle-laden flows in the upcoming exascale computing era.},

Contact models for complex shapes have been proposed in literature, and most limit the accuracy of the particle-fluid interaction. For this reason, this paper presents a novel contact model for complex convex particle shapes for use with partially saturated methods, in which we propose to obtain necessary contact properties, such as the indentation depth, by a discretization of the contact area. The goal of the proposed model is to enable comprehensive and accurate studies of particulate flows, especially with high volume fractions, that lead to new insights and contribute to the improvement of existing industrial processes. To ensure correctness and sustainability, we validate the model extensively by studying cases with and without fluid. In the latter case, we use the homogenized lattice Boltzmann method. The provided investigations show a great agreement of the proposed discrete contact model with analytical solutions and the literature.},

Two numerical methods are used to compute their permeability by homogenization: the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based method. The results given by both methods are shown to be consistent with semi-analytical and experimental results. For an identical discretization grid, the FFT method has the lowest memory and computational time requirements. The LBM is more accurate for coarse to moderately fine discretizations, while the FFT method converges linearly with the voxel size h with a relative discretization error below 1.5 times h/D25{$\mkern1mu$}, where D25 is the 25\% passing by mass grain diameter. The issue of the variability of the permeability computed on finite sized samples is determined either directly by many realizations of similar random samples or indirectly by a faster filtering method on a single sample. Both methods yield similar results and indicate that a Representative Volume Element (RVE) size greater than 7{$\mkern1mu$}D40 guarantees a variability of permeability below 5\%.},

  abstract = {The recently introduced roofline model plots the performance of executed code against its operational intensity (operations count divided by memory traffic). It also includes two platform-specific performance ceilings: the processor's peak performance and a ceiling derived from the memory bandwidth, which is relevant for code with low operational intensity. The model thus makes more precise the notions of memory- and compute-bound and, despite its simplicity, can provide an insightful visualization of bottlenecks. As such it can be valuable to guide manual code optimization as well as in education. Unfortunately, to date the model has been used almost exclusively with backof-the-envelope calculations and not with measured data. In this paper we show how to produce roofline plots with measured data on recent generations of Intel platforms. We show how to accurately measure the necessary quantities for a given program using performance counters, including threaded and vectorized code, and for warm and cold cache scenarios. We explain the measurement approach, its validation, and discuss limitations. Finally, we show, to this extent for the first time, a set of roofline plots with measured data for common numerical functions on a variety of platforms and discuss their possible uses.},

Moreover, the mechanical characteristics of soil are described in the sense that these characteristics including modulus, strength, damping, and modulus degradation of soil play critical roles for the design of offshore foundations. By using these mechanical properties of soil, theoretical studies to consider structure-soil interaction are classified (into equivalent spring models, distributed spring models, and continuous element models) and explained. Field and laboratory experiments on the response of structure embedded in soil to static and dynamic loads are discussed. Based on the review of previous studies, directions for future research and study on offshore wind turbine are suggested.},

In this context, the portability of codes across different architectures is of major importance. This paper presents a portable implementation model based on an algebraic operational approach for DNS and LES of incompressible turbulent flows using unstructured hybrid meshes. The strategy proposed consists in representing the whole time-integration algorithm using only three basic algebraic operations: sparse matrix-vector product, a linear combination of vectors and dot product. The main idea is based on decomposing the non-linear operators into a concatenation of two SpMV operations. This provides high modularity and portability. An exhaustive analysis of the proposed implementation for hybrid CPU/GPU supercomputers has been conducted with tests using up to 128 GPUs. The main objective consists in understanding the challenges of implementing CFD codes on new architectures.},

Three-dimensional flow through two porous media---a body-centered cubic (BCC) array of spheres and a random-sized sphere-pack---are examined in this study. For flow past a BCC array of spheres, we validate the linear LBE model by comparing its results with the nonlinear LBE model. We investigate systematically the viscosity-dependence of the computed permeability, the discretization error, and effects due to the choice of relaxation parameters with the MRT and BGK schemes. Our results show unequivocally that the MRT--LBE model is superior to the BGK--LBE model, and interpolation significantly improves the accuracy of the fluid--solid boundary conditions.},

In this paper, we present flume experiments that we conducted to investigate the variability of antidune geometry and migration celerity, a variability observed even under steadystate conditions. Quantifying this variability is important for river morphodynamics, hydraulics and paleohydraulics. We imposed moderate to intense bedload transport rates at the flume inlet to assess their effects on antidune morphodynamics for nearconstant values of the mean bed slope. The bed elevation profile was monitored for each experiment with high spatial and temporal resolution. Upstream migrating antidunes were observed along most of the flume length. Considering single values for wavelength and celerity was not sufficient to describe the antidune behaviour in these experiments. By using spectral analysis, we identified the variability ranges of bedform shape and celerity. Interestingly, migration celerity increased with increasing antidune wavelength; the opposite trend was reported for dunes in other studies. Antidunes were more uniform and migrated faster for higher sediment feeding rates. Scaling the spectra made it possible to find a general dimensionless relationship between antidune wavelength and celerity. This framework provides a novel method for estimating the mean bedload transport rate in the presence of upstream migrating antidunes.},

  abstract = {Suction bucket foundations for offshore wind turbines (OWT) have considerable advantages compared to conventional foundation types: Due to the installation process with dead weight and applied negative pressure, noise from pile driving can be completely avoided. In addition, the installation process of the whole substructure, consisting of the buckets connected to the jacket, can be carried out in one work step, which increases efficiency. A prototype of the suction bucket jacket was installed in the wind park `Borkum Riffgrund 1' (North Sea) in August 2014. Due to the pre-installed and comprehensive measuring system, it was possible to monitor all installation and operating phases. The data analysis of a storm event show an amplitude and frequency-dependent behaviour of the soil stiffness and the suction bucket foundation without wind turbine. In the frequency range of the first and second eigenfrequency (0.2 Hz {$<$} f {$<$} 5 Hz), the system behaves linearly. Here, the Frequency Domain Decomposition is used for identification and monitoring. For the lower frequency band (0.05 Hz {$<$} f {$<$} 0.2 Hz) where higher forces and displacements occur, a non-linear multilayer perceptron is chosen to model the non-linear relations between measurements. By applying two mathematical models for the relevant frequency ranges, all the information from the measurement data can be used for system identification and novelty detection under varying environmental conditions.},

With a properly chosen equilibrium distribution, the Navier-Stokes equation is obtained from the kinetic BGK equation at the second-order of approximation. Compared to lattice gases, the present model is noise-free, has Galileian invariance and a velocityindependent pressure. I t involves a relaxation parameter that influences the stability of the new scheme. Numerical simulations are shown to confirm the speed of sound and the shear viscosity.},

  abstract = {Suction buckets represent a viable solution as foundations for offshore wind turbines. Installation in sand is relatively straightforward, albeit with limited understanding of the resulting changes in soil state. This paper describes an experimental methodology that allows for visualisation and quantification of changes in soil state during suction bucket installation, validated in sand. Insights obtained from particle image velocimetry analyses, performed on images of a half-bucket installing against a Perspex window taken in a geotechnical centrifuge are discussed. Compared with the initial self-weight penetration, the deformation mechanism governing the suction-assisted phase shows a preference for the soil below the skirt tips to move inwards and upwards inside the bucket. The installation process is responsible for changes in relative density and permeability within the bucket. In these experiments, the majority of the soil plug heave can be attributed to the soil displaced inwards by the advancing skirts, with a minor contribution caused by dilation. The confidence in the experimental methodology provided through the results of suction bucket installation in sand discussed herein now enables suction bucket installation in more complex seabeds to be investigated.},

Although the required suction can be predicted well using existing methods, uncertainty remains around some input parameters, because the effects of suction installation on the soil state are not understood in detail. This paper visualises the mechanisms governing both initial self-weight penetration and following suction-assisted installation in dense sand. Pioneering particle image velocimetry measurements in a centrifuge environment underpinned the investigation, with details of the experimental apparatus offered in the paper. Changes in the deformation mechanisms governing the installation process and in the soil properties are revealed. The findings have an impact on the understanding of the formation of internal plug heave -- the cause of premature refusal --and the prediction of the installation response. Revealing changes in void ratio and permeability also present implications on the accumulated displacements under the metocean loading, which may conflict with serviceability requirements.},

Evaluating and calculating the required particle interactions in a simulation is computationally expensive, hence suitable algorithms and proper optimizations to exploit available parallelism in the target hardware are important to reach good performance. However, it is difficult to maintain flexible implementations while keeping state-of-the-art performance, as most packages are developed individually and have their own hard-coded, fine-tuned implementations. To combine flexibility and optimal performance, we introduce P4IRS, an intermediate representation and compiler for particle simulations which is aimed at delivering good performance. We describe P4IRS, display usage examples and features, discussing the benefits we can obtain with code generation. Finally, we evaluate the performance and scalability from the code generated by P4IRS on modern processors, accelerators and supercomputers in both MD and DEM fields.},

This thesis develops a coupled fluid-particle simulation method that tackles these challenges and demonstrates its usability for such fully resolved simulations at the microscale. To this end, we combine the lattice Boltzmann method with the discrete element method in the open-source framework waLBerla. While the former method is used to efficiently represent the fluid flow dynamics, the discrete element method accounts for frictional collisions between the rigid particles.

The physical interactions are complex and thus evaluating and quantifying the factors of influence is challenging. Simulation models can be used to conduct large scale parameter studies and allow a more detailed analysis of the system than laboratory experiments. Here, we present new coupled numerical models for sediment transport that are based on first principles. The lattice Boltzmann method is used in combination with a non-smooth granular dynamics model to simulate the fluid flow and the sediment particles. Numerical predictions of dune formation require a fully resolved modeling of the particulate flow which is only achieved by massively parallel simulations. For that purpose, the method employs advanced parallel grid refinement techniques and carefully designed compute kernels. The weak- and strong-scaling behavior is evaluated in detail and shows overall excellent parallel performance and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Classical scaling relationships for rheological quantities such as the {$\mu$}(J)-rheology have become increasingly popular for closures of two-phase flow modelling. However, these frameworks have been derived for monodisperse particles. We aim to extend these considerations to sediment transport modelling by using a more realistic sediment composition. We investigate the rheological behaviour of sheared sediment beds composed of polydisperse spherical particles in a laminar Couette-type shear flow. The sediment beds consist of particles with a diameter size ratio of up to 10, which corresponds to grains ranging from fine to coarse sand. The data was generated using fully coupled, grain resolved direct numerical simulations using a combined lattice Boltzmann--discrete element method. These highly resolved data yield detailed depth-resolved profiles of the relevant physical quantities that determine the rheology, i.e. the local shear rate of the fluid, particle volume fraction, total shear and granular pressure. A comparison against experimental data shows excellent agreement for the monodisperse case. We improve upon the parameterization of the {$\mu$}(J)-rheology by expressing its empirically derived parameters as a function of the maximum particle volume fraction. Furthermore, we extend these considerations by exploring the creeping regime for viscous numbers much lower than used by previous studies to calibrate these correlations. Considering the low viscous numbers of our data, we found that the friction coefficient governing the quasi-static state in the creeping regime tends to a finite value for vanishing shear, which decreases the critical friction coefficient by a factor of three for all cases investigated.},

  author = {Robbins, Bryant A and {van Beek}, Vera M},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Backward erosion piping refers to the process by which seepage forces gradually erode cohesionless material from the foundation of dams and levees, thereby forming shallow pipes at the interface of the granular material and a cohesive cover layer. Piping is often expressed at the ground surface downstream of an embankment in the form of sand boils. If allowed to continue, the piping process may undermine the entire structure, leading to failure. As a primary failure mode of concern for dams and levees in both the United States and the Netherlands, the probability of piping failure is often assessed as part of routine risk assessments. Different methods of assessing piping potential have been published in the literature. Additionally, numerous papers have been published reporting laboratory test results on the piping potential of various soils. While useful, the correct application of the methods in the literature requires an understanding of the context from which each method was developed. Likewise, correct application of the laboratory testing data requires an understanding of the various test conditions, namely density, exit configuration, soil characteristics, and scale effects, that significantly impact the laboratory results. This paper provides practitioners with the information required to independently determine whether the various assessment methods and laboratory test data are applicable to their specific projects. The background, advantages, and disadvantages of each piping assessment method are discussed through a review of the evolution of piping knowledge over the past century. The influences of experiment scale and exit configuration on critical gradients are illustrated through comparisons of differing laboratory test data. Lastly, a brief discussion of ongoing piping research is provided to highlight current knowledge gaps to be aware of while assessing risks of backward erosion piping.},

In computer simulations one can therefore save a large amount of computer time by replacing the solvent with a lattice fluid. The macromolecules are propagated by Molecular Dynamics (MD), while the fluid is governed by the fluctuating Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) equation. We present a fluctuating LB implementation for a single graphics card (GPU) coupled to a MD simulation running on conventional processors (CPUs). Particular emphasis lies on the optimization of the combined code. In our implementation, the LB update is performed in parallel with the force calculation on the CPU, which often completely hides the additional computational cost of the LB. Compared to our parallel LB implementation on a conventional quadcore CPU, the GPU LB is 50 times faster, and we show that a whole commodity cluster with Infiniband interconnnect cannot outperform a single GPU in strong scaling. The presented code is part of the open source simulation package ESPResSo (http://www.espressomd.org).},

This article presents the first numerical attempt to simulate upstream-migrating antidunes with geometrically resolved particles and a liquid-gas interface. Our simulations provide more insights into antidune-migration mechanisms than laboratory experiments and contribute to gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying physics. To manage the simulations' computational costs and physical complexity, we employ the cumulant lattice Boltzmann method in conjunction with a discrete element method for particle interactions, as well as a volume of fluid scheme to track the deformable free surface of the fluid. By reproducing two flow configurations of previous experiments (Pascal et al., Earth Surf. Proc. Land., vol. 46(9), 2021, 1750-1765), we demonstrate that our approach is robust and accurately predicts the antidunes' amplitude, wavelength, and celerity. Furthermore, the simulated wall-shear stress, a key parameter governing sediment transport, is in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements. These highly resolved fluid and particle motion data already allow for a first analysis of the mechanism controlling the migrating pattern of the antidunes. Our simulation approach opens new perspectives for detailed studies of morphodynamics in shallow supercritical flows.},

  abstract = {The interaction of supercritical turbulent flows with granular sediment beds is challenging to study both experimentally and numerically. This challenging task has hampered advances in understanding antidunes, the most characteristic bedform of supercritical flows. This article presents the first numerical attempt to simulate upstream-migrating antidunes with geometrically resolved particles and a liquid--gas interface. Our simulations provide data at a resolution higher than laboratory experiments, and they can therefore provide new insights into the mechanisms of antidune migration and contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying physics. To manage the simulations' computational costs and physical complexity, we employ the cumulant lattice Boltzmann method in conjunction with a discrete element method for particle interactions, as well as a volume-of-fluid scheme to track the deformable free surface of the fluid. By reproducing two flow configurations of previous experiments (Pascal et al., Earth Surf. Process. Landf., vol. 46, issue 9, 2021, pp. 1750--1765), we demonstrate that our approach is robust and accurately predicts the antidunes' amplitude, wavelength and celerity. Furthermore, the simulated wall shear stress, a key parameter governing sediment transport, is in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements. The highly resolved data of fluid and particle motion from our simulation approach open new perspectives for detailed studies of morphodynamics in shallow supercritical flows.},

The problem sizes of these applications are limited by the GPU device memory capacity, which is typically smaller than the host memory. On GPU supercomputers, a locality improvement technique using temporal blocking method with memory swapping between host and device enables large computation beyond the device memory capacity. However, because the loop management of temporal blocking with data movement across these memories increase programming difficulty, the applying this methodology to the real stencil applications demands substantially higher programming cost. Our high-productivity stencil framework automatically applies temporal blocking to boundary exchange required for stencil computation and supports automatic memory swapping provided by a MPI/CUDA wrapper library. The framework-based application for the airflow in an urban city maintains 80\% performance even with the twice larger than the GPU memory capacity and have demonstrated good weak scalability on the TSUBAME 2.5 supercomputer.},

  abstract = {Abstract An extended period numerical integration of a baroclinic primitive equation model has been made for the simulation and the study of the dynamics of the atmosphere's general circulation. The solution corresponding to external gravitational propagation is filtered by requiring the vertically integrated divergence to vanish identically. The vertical structure permits as dependent variables the horizontal wind at two internal levels and a single temperature, with the static stability entering as a parameter. The incoming radiation is a function of latitude only corresponding to the annual mean, and the outgoing radiation is taken to be a function of the local temperature. With the requirement for thermal equilibrium, the domain mean temperature is specified as a parameter. The role of condensation is taken into account only as it effectively reduces the static stability. All other external sources and sinks of heat are assumed to balance each other locally, and are thus omitted. The kinematics are that of a fluid on a sphere bounded by smooth zonal walls at the equator and at approximately 64{$^\circ$} latitude. The dissipative sinks are provided by: (a) surface stresses proportional through a drag coefficient to the square of the surface wind which is suitably extrapolated from above, (b) internal convective stresses proportional to the vertical wind shear, and (c) lateral diffusion of momentum and heat through an exchange coefficient which depends on the local horizontal rate of strain---a horizontal length scale entering as the governing parameter. For a given specification of the parameters, an integration for 60 days has been made from initial conditions where random temperature disturbances have been superimposed on a zonally symmetric regime which is baroclinically unstable according to linear theory. This experiment not only displays the scale selective character of baroclinic instability, yielding zonal wave number 5 to 6, but also predicts an index or energy cycle. The period of this cycle is 11 to 12 days for the first 40 days of the experiment, then lengthening to 17 days while diminishing in amplitude during the latter part. The resulting mean zonal velocity profile is in good qualitative agreement with observation, but too intense, presumably because the effective static stability parameter is taken too large. Furthermore this profile is found to be no more than 5 percent super-geostrophic poleward of the angular momentum maximum and no more than 2 percent sub-geostrophic equatorward. The total zonal angular momentum remains constant to within 2 percent irrespective of the phase of the index cycle. This balance is controlled by the surface wind distribution which agrees quite well with observation. The poleward transport is mainly accomplished by the large-scale eddies, whereas the internal vertical flux is predominantly a transfer of the earth's angular momentum by the meridional circulation. The poleward heat transport is primarily accomplished by a Hadley circulation at low latitudes but by the large-scale horizontal eddies in mid-latitudes, where a Ferrel circulation tends to compensate through an equatorward flux. This compensation at mid-latitudes by an indirect meridional circulation is also quite evident, in the potential-kinetic energy transformations. Comparison of the momentum and heat transfer with observed data when available shows reasonably good quantitative agreement. The lateral transfer of momentum and heat by the non-linear diffusion, which parametrically is supposed to simulate the action of motions of sub-grid scale, accounts for a significant portion of the total eddy transfer. Although no direct comparison with the corresponding transfer in the real atmosphere is available, intuitively our small-scale diffusion appears to play too large a role. A diagnosis is made of the transformations among the baratropic and baroclinic parts of the kinetic energy as well as the zonal mean and zonal perturbation parts of the available potential and kinetic energy. This reveals the dominant paths that the energy passes through from source to ultimate sinks and the processes responsible for these transformations. It is found that the partitioning of dissipation by the energy components may differ considerably from estimates made from observation.},

  abstract = {This paper establishes the range of validity for a previously published three-dimensional moving solid boundary condition for the lattice-Boltzmann method. This method was reasonably formulated from a mass and momentum balance perspective, but was only verified for a small range of (primarily twodimensional) problems. One of the advantages of this boundary condition is that it offers resolution at the sub-grid scale, allowing for accurate and stable calculation of the force and torque for solids which are moving through a lattice, even for small solid sizes relative to the computational grid size. We verify the boundary condition for creeping flows by comparison to analytical solutions that include both the force and the torque on fixed and moving spheres, and then follow this with comparisons to experimental and empirical results for both fixed as well moving spheres in inertial flows. Finally, we compare simulation results to numerical results of other investigators for the settling of an offset sphere and the drafting--kissing--tumbling of two sedimenting spheres. We found that an accurate calculation of the collision-operator weighting used to obtain sub-grid-scale resolution was necessary in order to prevent spikes in the velocities, forces, and moments when solid objects cross-computational cells. The wide range of comparisons collected and presented in this paper can be used to establish the validity of other numerical models, in addition to the one examined here.

A numerical model is defined at three different scales: the block scale, the elementary representative volume scale and the dam scale. The model uses the discrete element code PCF2D, considering breakable clusters of 2D balls. Three rock-ageing laws, taking into account the time-evolving resistance for blocks, are proposed. The different parameters are determined from experimental data of laboratory tests performed on rock blocks. The relevance of the model seems acceptable, considering that the displacements obtained in the simulations are in the same order of magnitude as the displacements measured on the actual dam.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces improvements to the simulation of particle suspensions using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the discrete element method (DEM). First, the benefit of using a two-relaxation-time (TRT) collision operator, instead of the popular Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook (BGK) collision operator, is demonstrated. Second, a modified solid weighting function for the partially saturated method (PSM) for fluid--solid interaction is defined and tested. Results are presented for a range of flow configurations, including sphere packs, duct flows, and settling spheres, with good accuracy and convergence observed. Past research has shown that the drag, and consequently permeability, predictions of the LBM exhibit viscosity-dependence when used with certain boundary conditions such as bounce-back or interpolated bounce-back, and this is most pronounced when the BGK collision operator is employed. The improvements presented here result in a range of computational viscosities, and therefore relaxation parameters, within which drag and permeability predictions remain invariant. This allows for greater flexibility in using the relaxation parameter to adjust the LBM timestep, which can subsequently improve synchronisation with the time integration of the DEM. This has significant implications for the simulation of largescale suspension phenomena, where the limits of computational hardware persistently constrain the resolution of the LBM lattice.},

The superellipsoid shape formulation can be viewed as an extension of spherical or ellipsoidal shapes and can be used to represent spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical, diamond-like and cubic particles by varying solely five shape parameters.

GPUs (graphic processing units), with their massive parallel architecture and high floating point performance, provide new possibilities for largescale DPS. In this paper, a multi-scale CPU (central processing unit)--GPU hybrid computation mode is developed, in which the fluid flow is computed by CPU(s) while the particle motion is computed by GPU(s). To explore its feasibility, this mode is adopted to simulate the flow structures in the fluidization of Geldart D and A particles, respectively. Further coupled with an EMMS (energy minimization multi-scale) based meso-scale model, the flow behavior in an industrial fluidized bed is finally simulated, shedding light on the engineering applications of DPS, as an alternative to TFM.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical Simulation for exploring the characteristlcs of soils and porewater pressure development during the suction hucket Installation in the sand. The dynamic-mesh technology and new drag force model considering Irregul{\"a}r particle shapes are adopted in the CFD-DEM model. By comparlng the results of experimental and theoretical models, the validation of the numerical program has heen proved. Then, tliis study is motivated by the fact that marine Sediments generally exhibit a porosity decreasing with depth because of consolidation under gravity. Results demonstrate that the seabed face porosity is the critical factor that causes differences in penetration resistance and porewater pressure distribution at late installation stages. Additlonally, Penetration mechanisms with different depths are analyzed by particle migration, porewater pressure distribu\- tion, and flow field. Based on microscopic analysis, apart from seepage would induce a noticeable migration of fine particles, the apparent soil-squeezing effect is another essential factor to cause soil displacement and expansion in dense sand. Finally, tlie b{\"u}cket can be safely installed in sand, despite the permeability coefficient inside the hucket reaching the critical state. Such a macro and micro insight will further facilitate the design of suction b{\"u}cket installation, particularly considering the influence of sand permeability.},

  abstract = {We study the effects of fluid--particle and particle--particle interactions in a three-dimensional monodispersed reactor with unstable fluidization. Simulations were conducted using the immersed boundary method for particle Reynolds numbers of 20--70 with an Archimedes number of 23~600. Two different flow regimes were identified as a function of the particle Reynolds number. For low particle Reynolds numbers (                                                                      \$20 {$<$} Re\_p {$<$} 40\$                                               ), the porosity is relatively low and the particle dynamics are dominated by interparticle collisions that produce anisotropic particle velocity fluctuations. The relative importance of hydrodynamic effects increases with increasing particle Reynolds number, leading to a minimized anisotropy in the particle velocity fluctuations at an intermediate particle Reynolds number. For high particle Reynolds numbers (                                                                      \$Re\_p {$>$} 40\$                                               ), the particle dynamics are dominated by hydrodynamic effects, leading to decreasing and more anisotropic particle velocity fluctuations. A sharp increase in the anisotropy occurs when the particle Reynolds number increases from 40 to 50, corresponding to a transition from a regime in which collision and hydrodynamic effects are equally important (regime 1) to a hydrodynamic-dominated regime (regime 2). The results imply an optimum particle Reynolds number of roughly 40 for the investigated Archimedes number of 23~600 at which mixing in the reactor is expected to peak, which is consistent with reactor studies showing peak performance at a similar particle Reynolds number and with a similar Archimedes number. Results also show that maximum effective collisions are attained at intermediate particle Reynolds number. Future work is required to relate optimum particle Reynolds number to Archimedes number.},

Simulations were conducted using the immersed boundary method with direct forcing for triply periodic cases and with                                                                      \$Ar = 21 - 23{\textbackslash},600\$                                               and                                                                      \${\textbackslash}phi = 0.22 - 0.43\$                                               . We find that cluster formation is strongly dependent on the Archimedes number but weakly dependent on the volume fraction for concentrated suspensions. Particles in low                                                                      \$Ar\$                                               cases are characterized by less frequent but long-lived clusters, resulting in higher hindered settling, while high                                                                      \$Ar\$                                               cases consist of more frequent but short-lived clusters, leading to reduced hindered settling. By quantifying the effects of collisions on the hydrodynamic fluctuations, we show that the lifespan of clusters for the low                                                                      \$Ar\$                                               cases is longer because particles are subject to appreciable wake interactions without collisions. On the other hand, clusters for high                                                                      \$Ar\$                                               cases are broken before being subject to appreciable wake interactions due to frequent collisions, leading to a shorter cluster lifespan. The results imply that there exists an                                                                      \$Ar\$                                               for particles in fluidized bed reactors that can reduce short circuiting due to clustering and enhance performance by maximizing flow--particle interactions. This result is consistent with existing reactor studies demonstrating that optimal particle diameters and                                                                      \$Ar\$                                               values correspond to cases with short-lived clusters, although more thorough experimental studies are needed.},

  abstract = {The objective of the paper is to assess the effectiveness of the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) as a computational tool for performing direct numerical simulations (DNS) and large-eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent flows. Decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) in inertial and rotating frames is considered for this investigation. We perform three categories of simulations. The first category involves LBE-DNS of HIT. In the inertial frame of reference, the decay exponents of the kinetic energy k, the dissipation rate e and the low wave-number scaling of the energy spectrum are studied. The LBE results agree well with established classical results. In the case of turbulence subject to frame rotation, the LBE simulations confirm that the energy decay rate decreases with Rossby number as the energy cascade is inhibited by rotation. Second, we carry out LBE-LES for decaying HIT in inertial frame. We compute kinetic energy decay, energy spectrum and flow structures. By comparing LBE-LES and LBE-DNS results, we observe that LBE-LES accurately captures prominent large scale flow behavior. We find that the Smagorinsky constant CS in LBE-LES should be smaller than the typical value used in traditional Navier--Stokes (NS) LES approaches. Finally, we compare the LBE-LES and NS-LES (of comparable order of numerical accuracy) results for HIT and observe that the LBE-LES simulations appear to preserve instantaneous flow fields somewhat more accurately. Our results clearly indicate that the LBE method can accurately capture important features of decaying HIT and is potentially a reliable computational tool for turbulence simulations.},

In the present computations, the particle Reynolds number ranges from 2 to 250 at separation distances to the wall from nearly sitting on the wall to far away from the wall. First we characterize the structure of the wake for a stationary particle in a linear shear flow and compare with those for a particle moving parallel to a wall in a quiescent ambient [see L. Zeng, S. Balachandar, and P. Fischer, J. Fluid Mech.\hphantom{,}536, 1 (2005)]. For both these cases we present drag and lift results and obtain composite drag and lift correlations that are valid for a wide range of Re and distance from the wall. These correlations have been developed to be consistent with all available low Reynolds number theories and approach the appropriate uniform flow results at large distance from the wall. Particular attention is paid to the case of particle in contact with the wall and the computational results are compared with those from experiments.},

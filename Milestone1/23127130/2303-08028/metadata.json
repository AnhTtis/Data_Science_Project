    "abstract": "The relevant features for a machine learning task may be aggregated from data sources collected on different nodes in a network. This problem, which we call decentralized prediction, creates a number of interesting systems challenges in managing data routing, placing computation, and time-synchronization. This paper presents EdgeServe, a machine learning system that can serve decentralized predictions. EdgeServe relies on a low-latency message broker to route data through a network to nodes that can serve predictions. EdgeServe relies on a series of novel optimizations that can tradeoff computation, communication, and accuracy. We evaluate EdgeServe on three decentralized prediction tasks: (1) multi-camera object tracking, (2) network intrusion detection, and (3) human activity recognition.",

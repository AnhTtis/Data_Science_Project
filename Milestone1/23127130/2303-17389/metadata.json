    "abstract": "The current work focuses on the Gaussian-Minkowski problem in dimension 2. In particular, we show that if the Gaussian surface area measure is proportional to the spherical Lebesgue measure, then the corresponding convex body has to be a centered disk. As an application, this ``uniqueness'' result is used to prove the existence of smooth small solutions to the Gaussian-Minkowski problem via a degree-theoretic approach.",

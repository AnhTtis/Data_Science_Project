abstract = {The adsorption of oxygen on Ag(110), (111), and (100) surfaces has been investigated by LEED, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and by the measurement of work function changes and of kinetics, at and above room temperature and at oxygen pressures up to 10−5Torr. Extreme conditions of cleanliness were necessary to exclude the disturbing influences, which seem to have plagued earlier measurements. Extensive results were obtained on the (110) face. Adsorption proceeds with an initial sticking coefficient of about 3 × 10−3 at 300 K, which drops very rapidly with coverage. Dissociative adsorption via a precursor is inferred. The work function change is strictly proportional to coverage and can therefore be used to follow adsorption and desorption kinetics; at saturation, ΔΦ ≈ 0.85 eV. Adsorption proceeds by the growth of chains of oxygen atoms perpendicular to the grooves of the surface. The chains keep maximum separation by repulsive lateral interactions, leading to a consecutive series of (n × 1) superstructures in LEED, with n running from 7 to 2. The initial heat of adsorption is found to be 40 kcal/mol. Complicated desorption kinetics are found in temperature-programmed and isothermal desorption measurements. The results are discussed in terms of structural and kinetic models. Very small and irreproducible effects were observed on the (111) face which is interpreted in terms of a general inertness of the close-packed face and of some adsorption at irregularities. On the (100) face, oxygen adsorbs in a disordered structure; from ΔΦ measurements two adsorption states are inferred, between which a temperature-dependent equilibrium seems to exist.}

abstract = {The adsorption of oxygen on the ruthenium (001) surface has been studied using a combination of techniques: LEED/Auger, Kelvin probe contact potential changes, and flash desorption mass spectrometry. Oxygen is rapidly adsorbed at 300 K, forming an ordered LEED structure having apparent (2 × 2) symmetry. Two binding states of oxygen are inferred from the abrupt change in surface work function as a function of oxygen coverage. LEED intensity measurements indicate that the oxygen layer undergoes an order-disorder transition at temperatures several hundred degrees below the onset of desorption. The order-disorder transition temperature is a function of the oxygen coverage, consistent with two binding states. A model involving the adsorption of atomic oxygen at θ < 0.5 and the formation of complexes with higher oxygen content at θ > 0.5 is proposed. The oxidation of CO to form CO2 was found to have the maximum rate of production at a ruthenium temperature of 950 K.}

abstract = {Diamond is an outstanding material offering an unparalleled level of choice considering combinations and variations of numerous properties together; nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) inherits most of the superior properties of bulk diamond and delivers them at the nanoscale. Understanding and controlling the heteroepitaxial growth is a major challenge in diamond research and the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process has been demonstrated as an efficient avenue toward that goal. Low-pressure plasma CVD provides significant advantages for a fundamental improvement of quality, and to meet the technological challenges of synthesizing superior diamond phases at relatively low temperatures. The key to evaluating the suitability of CVD-NCD is to view from a system perspective that offers not only a performance increase, but also an associated volume compaction, weight reduction, and improvement in reliability. NCD is truly a multifunctional material that exhibits a broad range of functionalities extended towards innumerable applications ranging from complementary mechanical and tribological applications, as a suitable additive for coolants to improve heat dissipation, as a dielectric layer with controlled charging–discharging behavior, in cold cathode emitters, electrochemical electrodes, as conducting or insulating layers in MEMS devices, electrical insulating and dielectric passivation layers, in the construction of lithium batteries, as an electrode with an extremely wide electrochemical potential window, for integration of microelectronics with biological modification and sensing, as vectors for in vitro gene delivery via surface immobilization and covalent conjugation, as well as an excellent carbon-based nanofiller for the mechanical reinforcement of polymer matrices for many uses including biopolymeric bone scaffolds.}

In two dimensions, we complete an argument of Zamolodchikov showing that the rigid invariance implies the local under broad conditions. In three or more dimensions we are unable to find either a general proof or a counterexample, but we find some new conformally invariant systems.}

  howpublished = "This bootstrap island was reported in the preprint arXiv:1807.04434. Shortly after that, the work of \cite{Atanasov:2018kqw} also found the same bootstrap island using SUSY OPE relations involving scalar operators. We should emphasize that to obtain a higher precision result of the critical exponents and to generalize the method to study SCFTs with flavor symmetry, it is essential to include all the SUSY OPE relations."

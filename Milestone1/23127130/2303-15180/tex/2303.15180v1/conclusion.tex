\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We propose the first backdoor detection method \toolname for pre-trained encoders. Our method fills in the gap where existing detection techniques only focus on supervised learning scenarios. Our evaluation shows that \toolname can effectively and efficiently separate benign and trojaned encoders. Our method is also robust against adaptive attacks and generalizes to a more challenging threat model.

\noindent
\textbf{Limitation of Our Work.} We currently do not handle text-format trigger. Our method mainly focuses on three types of attacks ({\it Image-on-Image}, {\it Image-on-Pair}, and {\it Text-on-Pair}), the attack subject of which is an image encoder. For {\it Text-on-Text} attack, it introduces extra challenges to invert text-format triggers as the input in NLP is discrete (e.g., words), different from the pixel values in computer vision.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes analytic forms of portfolio CoVaR and CoCVaR on the normal tempered stable market model. Since CoCVaR captures the relative risk of the portfolio with respect to a benchmark return, we apply it to the relative portfolio optimization. Moreover, we derive analytic forms for the marginal contribution to CoVaR and the marginal contribution to CoCVaR. We discuss the Monte-Carlo simulation method to calculate CoCVaR and the marginal contributions of CoVaR and CoCVaR. As the empirical illustration, we show relative portfolio optimization with thirty stocks under the distress condition of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Finally, we perform the risk budgeting method to reduce the CoVaR and CoCVaR of the portfolio based on the marginal contributions to CoVaR and CoCVaR.",

abstract = {We studied systemic risk in European sovereign debt markets before and after the onset of the Greek debt crisis, taking the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) as a systemic risk measure, characterized and computed using copulas. We found that, before the debt crisis, sovereign debt markets were all coupled and systemic risk was similar for all countries. However, with the onset of the Greek crisis, debt markets decoupled and the systemic risk of the countries in crisis (excepting Spain) for the European debt market as a whole decreased, whereas that of the non-crisis countries increased to a small degree. The systemic risk of the Greek debt market for other countries in difficulties increased, especially for Portugal where systemic risk tripled after the onset of the crisis, whereas the systemic impact on the non-crisis countries decreased.}

abstract = {We modify Adrian and Brunnermeier’s (2011) CoVaR, the VaR of the financial system conditional on an institution being in financial distress. We change the definition of financial distress from an institution being exactly at its VaR to being at most at its VaR. This change allows us to consider more severe distress events, to backtest CoVaR, and to improve its consistency (monotonicity) with respect to the dependence parameter. We define the systemic risk contribution of an institution as the change from its CoVaR in its benchmark state (defined as a one-standard deviation event) to its CoVaR under financial distress. We estimate the systemic risk contributions of four financial industry groups consisting of a large number of institutions for the sample period June 2000 to February 2008 and the 12months prior to the beginning of the crisis. We also investigate the link between institutions’ contributions to systemic risk and their characteristics.}

%abstract = {This article proposes a stylized model that reconciles several seemingly conflicting findings on financial security returns and option prices. The model is based on a pure jump Levy process, wherein the jump arrival rate obeys a power law dampened by an exponential function. The model allows for different degrees of dampening for positive and negative jumps and also for different pricing for upside and downside market risks. Calibration of the model to the S&P 500 index shows that the market charges only a moderate premium on upward index movements but the maximally allowable premium on downward index movements.},

\section*{Conclusion}

In this paper we have found that s-polarized light-sheets offer a more stable OTF, resulting in up to 30\% reduction in PSF volume for samples with high fluorescent anisotropy. We have also shown s-polarized excitation light to give up to 10\% increased optical efficiency for certain system configurations. We have found that s-polarized light-sheets increase optical efficiency for inclinations up to approximately 45$^{\circ}$. This increase in both achievable resolution and optical efficiency makes s-polarized light-sheets the better choise for most OPM setups. 

We also provide a software tool for simulating any arbitrary light-sheet imaging system (see Additional information). This software will allow users to find the PSF, OTF, and light transmission of any light-sheet imaging system as given in this paper.

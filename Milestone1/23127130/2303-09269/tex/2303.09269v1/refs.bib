Since two different sub-categories is distinguished only by the subtle differences in some specific parts, semantic part localization is crucial for fine-grained image classification. Most previous works improve the accuracy by looking for the semantic parts, but rely heavily upon the use of the object or part annotations of images whose labeling are costly. Recently, some researchers begin to focus on recognizing sub-categories via weakly supervised part detection instead of using the expensive annotations. However, these works ignore the spatial relationship between the object and its parts as well as the interaction of the parts, both of them are helpful to promote part selection. Therefore, this paper proposes a weakly supervised part selection method with spatial constraints for fine-grained image classification, which is free of using any bounding box or part annotations. We first learn a whole-object detector automatically to localize the object through jointly using saliency extraction and co-segmentation. Then two spatial constraints are proposed to select the distinguished parts. The first spatial constraint, called box constraint, defines the relationship between the object and its parts, and aims to ensure that the selected parts are definitely located in the object region, and have the largest overlap with the object region. The second spatial constraint, called parts constraint, defines the relationship of the object’s parts, is to reduce the parts’ overlap with each other to avoid the information redundancy and ensure the selected parts are the most distinguishing parts from other categories. Combining two spatial constraints promotes parts selection significantly as well as achieves a notable improvement on fine-grained image classification. Experimental results on CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method even compared with those methods using expensive annotations. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={He, Xiangteng and Peng, Yuxin}, year={2017}, month={Feb.} }

abstract = {Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to identify objects belonging to multiple sub-categories of the same super-category. The key to solving fine-grained classification problems is to learn discriminative visual feature representation with only subtle differences. Although previous work based on refined feature learning has made great progress, however, high-level semantic features often lack key information for fine-grained visual object nuances. How to efficiently integrate semantic information of different granularities from classification networks is a critical. In this paper, we propose Granularity-aware Distillation and Structure Modeling region Proposal Network(GDSMP-Net). Our solution integrates multi-granularity hierarchical information through a multi-granularity fusion learning strategy to enhance feature representation. In view of the inherent challenges of large intra-class differences in FGVC, a cross-layer self-distillation regularization is proposed to to strengthen the connection between high-level semantics and low-level semantics for robust multi-granularity feature learning. On this basis, we use a weakly supervised method to generate local branches, and the collaborative learning of discriminative semantics and structural semantics based on local regions, facilitating model to perceive contextual information to capture structural interactions between local semantics. Comprehensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four widely-used challenging datasets.(CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft and NA-birds).}

  abstract = 	 {Vision transformers (ViTs), which have demonstrated a state-of-the-art performance in image classification, can also visualize global interpretations through attention-based contributions. However, the complexity of the model makes it difficult to interpret the decision-making process, and the ambiguity of the attention maps can cause incorrect correlations between image patches. In this study, we propose a new ViT neural tree decoder (ViT-NeT). A ViT acts as a backbone, and to solve its limitations, the output contextual image patches are applied to the proposed NeT. The NeT aims to accurately classify fine-grained objects with similar inter-class correlations and different intra-class correlations. In addition, it describes the decision-making process through a tree structure and prototype and enables a visual interpretation of the results. The proposed ViT-NeT is designed to not only improve the classification performance but also provide a human-friendly interpretation, which is effective in resolving the trade-off between performance and interpretability. We compared the performance of ViT-NeT with other state-of-art methods using widely used fine-grained visual categorization benchmark datasets and experimentally proved that the proposed method is superior in terms of the classification performance and interpretability. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/jumpsnack/ViT-NeT.}

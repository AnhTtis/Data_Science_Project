    "abstract": "Models pre-trained on large-scale datasets are often finetuned to support newer tasks and datasets that arrive over time. This process necessitates storing copies of the model over time for each task that the pre-trained model is finetuned to. Building on top of recent model patching work, we propose $Δ$-Patching for finetuning neural network models in an efficient manner, without the need to store model copies. We propose a simple and lightweight method called $Δ$-Networks to achieve this objective. Our comprehensive experiments across setting and architecture variants show that $Δ$-Networks outperform earlier model patching work while only requiring a fraction of parameters to be trained. We also show that this approach can be used for other problem settings such as transfer learning and zero-shot domain adaptation, as well as other tasks such as detection and segmentation.",

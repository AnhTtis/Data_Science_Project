  Instructions are given for the preparation and submission of papers

\section{Double-Blind Reviewing Policy}
\label{sec:double-blind-policy}

ISIT 2023 enforces a soft double-blind reviewing policy.  Submissions
should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In
particular, authors' names, affiliations, email addresses, and funding
acknowledgments must not appear anywhere in the submission, and
authors should ensure that any references to their own related work
are in the third person.

We recommend to delay a publication of the paper on arXiv until after
the reviewing process is completed, but this is not enforced. Note,
however, that a reference to an arXiv-version of the presented work is
not permitted. Particularly, it is not allowed to refer to a more
detailed version of the work on arXiv (or anywhere else). In order to
allow for enough details to enable proper reviewing, the page limit
has been increased to 11~pages; see Section~\ref{sec:page-limit}
below.

The TPC chairs will reject papers that, in their sole judgment,
blatantly violate the requirement for author anonymity.

\subsection{Detailed Instructions for Double-Blind Submission}
\label{sec:deta-instr}

\begin{itemize}
\item Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title
  page.
\item Remove acknowledgments.
\item Remove project titles or names that could be used to trace back
  to the authors via web search.  
\item Carefully name your files to anonymize author information.
\item Carefully refer to related work, particularly your own. Do not
  omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer
  incapable of grasping the context. Instead, reference your past work
  in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related
  work by another author. For example, instead of ``In prior work [1],
  we presented a scheme that\ldots,'' sentences in the spirit of ``In
  prior work, Moser \emph{et al.} [1] presented a scheme that\ldots''
  should be used. In this way, the full citation of the referred paper
  can still be given, such as ``[1] S. M. Moser, \ldots''.  It is not
  acceptable to say ``[1] Reference deleted for double-blind review.''
\item We recommend to delay the posting of the submitted manuscript or
  its title/abstract on a public website, such as arXiv or on public
  mailing lists, until after the reviewing process is completed. (This
  is not enforced)
\item The submitted manuscript (PDF file) should be
  text-searchable. Any submission that does not meet this requirement
  may be returned without review.
\item Many of the editing tools automatically add metadata to the
  generated PDF file containing information that may violate the
  double-blind policy. Please remove any possible metadata that can
  link your manuscript to you. This includes removing names,
  affiliation, license numbers etc. from the metadata as well as from
  the paper. Failing to meet this requirement may also lead to a
  rejection without review.
\end{itemize}

Contact the TPC chairs if you have any questions regarding the
double-blind reviewing policy. 



\section{Page Limit}
\label{sec:page-limit}

The main body of a manuscript should not exceed \textbf{5 pages} in
length. There can be an \textbf{optional extra page} containing
references only. Moreover, the manuscript submitted for reviewing may
contain an \textbf{optional 5-page appendix} with additional proofs
and details that may be helpful for the reviewers. This appendix will
have to be removed in the final version of an accepted paper.

Summary: \textbf{5+1+5 in double-column format}.


\section{Paper Format}
\label{sec:paper-format}

\subsection{Template}
\label{sec:template}

The paper must be formatted as shown in this sample
\LaTeX{}-file. More help regarding \LaTeX{} can be found in
\cite{Laport:LaTeX, GMS:LaTeXComp, oetiker_latex, typesetmoser,
  shell15}. Note that the source of this file relies on IEEEtran.cls,
which is part of any modern \LaTeX{}-distribution and can be found on
\url{https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/}

The use of a text processing system other than \LaTeX{} is not
recommended. In particular, we very strongly discourage the use of
Microsoft Word.  Users of any text processing system other than
\LaTeX{} should attempt to duplicate the style of this example as
closely as possible (including font type and size).


\subsection{Formatting}
\label{sec:formatting}

The paper must be A4 or letter size and in double-column format.  The
style of references, equations, figures, tables, etc., should be the
same as for the \emph{IEEE Transactions on Information Theory}.

The source file of this template paper contains many more instructions
on how to format your paper. So, example code for different numbers of
authors, for figures and tables, and references can be found there
(they are commented out).

%%%%%%
%% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
%% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
%% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
%%
% \begin{figure}[htbp]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{myfigure}
%   % where a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex
%   \caption{Simulation results.}
%   \label{fig:sim}

%%%%%%
%% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
%% (The subfig package must be loaded for this to work; uncomment the
%% corresponding line in the document header.)  The *-version of
%% figure makes the figure use both columns. The subfigure \label
%% commands are set within each subfloat command, the \label for the
%% overall figure must come after \caption.  \hfil must be used as a
%% separator to get equal spacing.

%%%%%%
%% An example of a floating table.
%% Note that the \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table
%% text will default to \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this
%% smaller font for tables.  The \label must come after \caption as
%% always. The following example relies on booktabs.sty to fix poor
%% spacing within tables and using \toprule, \midrule, and \bottomrule
%% as proper replacement for the corresponding \hline

% \end{table}
%%%%%%


For instructions on how to typeset math, especially for multiple-line
equations with broken equations, we refer to \cite{typesetmoser}.

Pages should not be numbered and there should be no footer or header
(both will be added by us during the production of the
proceedings). The authors' affiliation shown in the final version of
accepted papers should constitute a sufficient mailing address for
persons who wish to contact the authors for more details about the
paper.


\subsection{PDF Requirements}
\label{sec:pdf-requirements}

Only electronic submissions in form of a PDF file will be
accepted. The PDF file has to be PDF/A compliant and text-searchable.

A common problem is missing fonts. Make sure that all fonts are
embedded. (In some cases, printing a PDF into a new PDF or creating a
new PDF with Acrobat Distiller may do the trick.) More information is
available from the IEEE website \cite{IEEE:AuthorToolbox}.

\section{Submission}
\label{sec:submission}

\subsection{Tracks}
\label{sec:tracks}

This conference features two tracks:
\begin{itemize}
\item For papers in the \textbf{in-person track}, one author must
  present the work personally in Taipei.
\item For papers in the \textbf{virtual track}, the presentations will
  be given live via zoom in front of a mixed virtual and live
  audience, i.e., the in-person attendees of the conference will be
  able to join the virtual sessions live in the conference
  center. Pre-recorded videos will not be accepted.

  The number of papers in the virtual track is limited, and thus a
  slot in the virtual track cannot be guaranteed.
\end{itemize}
In either track, a failure of a live presentation (in-person or via
zoom, respectively) of their work by one of the authors will result in
the removal of the paper from the published proceedings.


\subsection{Submission of Papers for Review}
\label{sec:subm-papers-revi}

Papers in the form of a PDF file, formatted as described above and
following the double-blind policy, may be submitted online at
\begin{center}
  \url{https://edas.info/N29759}
\end{center}
The deadlines for registering and uploading the paper in EDAS is
\begin{itemize}
\item for the virtual track: \textbf{January 3, 2023}, 23:59 Taiwan
  time (UTC+8);
\item for the in-person track: \textbf{January 22, 2023}, 23:59 Taiwan
  time (UTC+8).
\end{itemize}
Each paper must be classified as ``eligible for student paper award''
or ``not eligible for student paper award''. Papers that are selected
to be eligible for the student paper award should also contain
\emph{``THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD.''} as a
first line in the abstract. Note that this comment must be removed
again in the final manuscript.

\subsection{Submission of Accepted Papers}
\label{sec:subm-final-vers}

Please do not forget to remove the 5-page appendix if present and to
add authors' names and affiliations and all necessary acknowledgments.
Also remove the sentence \emph{``THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE
  STUDENT PAPER AWARD.''} in the abstract if present.

The deadline for the submission of the final version of accepted
papers is \textbf{May 6, 2023}, 23:59 Taiwan time (UTC+8).  Accepted
papers not submitted by that date will not appear in the ISIT
proceedings and will not be included in the technical program of the
ISIT.

Please make sure that the meta data in EDAS (list of authors, title
and abstract) match exactly the final version of your paper. For
generating the program booklet, the data in EDAS is used and not the
final version of the paper.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We conclude by pointing out that on the last page the columns need to
be balanced. Instructions for that purpose are given in the source
file (they are commented out).

%%%%%%
%% To balance the columns at the last page of the paper use this
%% command somewhere at the top of the first column of the last page:
%%
% \enlargethispage{-5cm} 
%%
%% where the exact amount of page reduction has to be adapted to the
%% actual situation.
%%
%% If the balancing should occur in the middle of the references, use
%% the following trigger:
%%
% \IEEEtriggeratref{3}
%%
%% which triggers a \newpage (i.e., new column) just before the given
%% reference number. Note that you need to adapt this if you modify
%% the paper. The "triggered" command can be changed if desired:
%%
% \IEEEtriggercmd{\enlargethispage{-20cm}}
%%
%%%%%%

%%%%%%
%% References:
%% We recommend the usage of BibTeX:
%%
%\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}
%\bibliography{definitions,bibliofile}
%%
%% where we here have assume the existence of the files
%% definitions.bib and bibliofile.bib.
%% BibTeX documentation can be obtained at:
%% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/doc/

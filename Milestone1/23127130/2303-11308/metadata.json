    "abstract": "We explore the effect of heat treatment in argon atmosphere under various temperatures up to $500^\\circ$C on single crystals of $α$-RuCl$_3$ by study of the mass loss, microprobe energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, powder x-ray diffraction, electrical resistance as well as low-temperature magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Clear signatures of dechlorination and oxidation of Ru appear for annealing temperatures beyond $300^\\circ$C. Analysis of the specific heat below 2~K reveals a RuO$_2$ mass fraction of order $1\\%$ for pristine $α$-RuCl$_3$ which increases up to $20\\%$ after thermal annealing, fully consistent with mass-loss analysis. The small RuO$_2$ inclusions drastically reduce the global electrical resistance and may thus significantly affect low-temperature thermal transport and Hall effect.",

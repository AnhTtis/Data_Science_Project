  \caption{Our method generates a high-quality 3D head avatar that can be rendered with unseen expressions and camera viewpoints (left). It is trained using multi-view data and multiresolution hash encoding and at test it is driven by a monocular RGB video. Our approach generates 2K full-head renderings (top right) for the first time in literature. It can also run in real time at $480\times270$ (bottom right).}

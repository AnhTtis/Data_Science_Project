\caption{Ablation study: Fixed view image synthesis for different design choices. \textit{Left to right}: Without canonical space, without feature conditioning, without optical flow based loss, and ours. The top row shows a rendering of Subject 3 (and ground truth), while the bottom row shows the error map. The error is computed as the per-pixel mean squared error (MSE), encoded in RGB color space. Here, blue denotes $0$ MSE, yellow is $60$ MSE, and reddish colors mean over $100$ MSE. Our full method achieves the best results.}

\caption{Quantitative comparison with the state of the art: \textit{Left to right}: Results of HyperNeRF++~\cite{park2021_hypernerf}, MVP~\cite{lombardi21_mvp}, NeRFBlendShape++~\cite{gao2022_nerfblendshape}, ours and ground truth. The top row shows visual results, while error maps are shown in the bottom row. The error is computed as the per-pixel mean squared error (MSE), encoded in RGB color space. Here, blue denotes $0$ MSE, yellow is $60$ MSE, and reddish colors mean over $100$ MSE. Our method clearly outperforms the state of the art.

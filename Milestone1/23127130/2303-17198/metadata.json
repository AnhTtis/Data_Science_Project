    "abstract": "An integrable discretization of the SIR model with vaccination is proposed. The conserved quantities of the continuous model are inherited to the discrete model through the discretization, since the discretization is based on the intersection structure of the non-algebraic invariant curve defined by the conserved quantities. Uniqueness of the forward/backward evolution of the discrete model is demonstrated in terms of the single-valuedness of the Lambert W function on the positive real axis. Furthermore, the exact solution to the continuous SIR model with vaccination is constructed via the integrable discretization. The discretization procedure similarly applied to the original SIR model leads to two kinds of integrable discretization, and the exact solution to the continuous SIR model is also deduced. It is moreover shown that the discrete SIR model geometrically linearizes the time evolution by using the non-autonomous parallel translation of the line intersecting the invariant curve.",

abstract = {We study the problem of online prophet-inequality matching in bipartite graphs. There is a static set of bidders and an online stream of items. We represent the interest of bidders in items by a weighted bipartite graph. Each bidder has a capacity, i.e., an upper bound on the number of items that can be allocated to her. The weight of a matching is the total weight of edges matched to the bidders. Upon the arrival of an item, the online algorithm should either allocate it to a bidder or discard it. The objective is to maximize the weight of the resulting matching. We consider this model in a stochastic setting where we know the distribution of the incoming items in advance. Furthermore, we allow the items to be drawn from different distributions, i.e., we may assume that the tth item is drawn from distribution Dt. In contrast to i.i.d. model, this allows us to model the change in the distribution of items throughout the time. We call this setting the Prophet-Inequality Matching because of the possibility of having a different distribution for each time. We generalize the classic prophet inequality by presenting an algorithm with the approximation ratio of 1--1/√k+3 where k is the minimum capacity. In case of k=2, the algorithm gives a tight ratio of 1/2 which is a different proof of the prophet inequality.We also consider a model in which the bidders do not have a capacity, instead each bidder has a budget. The weight of a matching is the minimum of the budget of each vertex and the total weight of edges matched to it, when summed over all bidders. We show that if the bid to the budget ratio of every bidder is at most 1/k then a natural randomized online algorithm has an approximation ratio of 1-kk/ekk! H 1--1/√2πk compared to the optimal offline (in which the ratio goes to 1 as k becomes large).We also present the applications of this model in Adword Allocation, Display Ad Allocation, and AdCell Model.},

schemes (EPTAS) for fundamental stochastic combinatorial optimization problems. Given
an error parameter ε&gt;0, such algorithmic schemes attain a (1-ε)-approximation in t(ε)·
poly(n) time, where t(·) is some function that depends only on ε. Technically speaking,
our approach relies on presenting tailor-made reductions to a newly-introduced multi-dimensional
load balancing problem. Even though the single-dimensional problem is already known
to be APX-Hard, we prove that an EPTAS can be designed under certain structural assumptions,
which hold for each of our applications. To demonstrate the versatility of our framework,
we first study selection-stopping settings to derive an EPTAS for the Free-Order Prophets
problem [Agrawal et al., EC'20] and for its cost-driven generalization, Pandora's
Box with Commitment [Fu et al., ICALP'18]. These results constitute the first approximation
schemes in the non-adaptive setting and improve on known inefficient polynomial time
approximation schemes (PTAS) for their adaptive variants. Next, turning our attention
to stochastic probing problems, we obtain an EPTAS for the adaptive ProbeMax problem
as well as for its non-adaptive counterpart; in both cases, state-of-the-art approximability
results have been inefficient PTASes [Chen et al., NIPS'16; Fu et al., ICALP'18].},

    abstract = { In a stochastic probing problem we are given a universe E, and a probability that each element e in E is active. We determine if an element is active by probing it, and whenever a probed element is active, we must permanently include it in our solution. Moreover, throughout the process we need to obey inner constraints on the set of elements taken into the solution, and outer constraints on the set of all probed elements. All previous algorithmic results in this framework have considered only the problem of maximizing a linear function of the active elements. Here, we consider submodular objectives. We provide new, constant-factor approximations for maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to multiple matroid constraints on both the elements that may be taken and the elements that may be probed. We also obtain an improved approximation for linear objective functions, and show how our approach may be generalized to handle k-matchoid constraints. }

Because of the presence of diminishing marginal values in real-world problems, our model can capture the effect of stochasticity in a wide range of applications. We show that the adaptivity gap—the ratio between the values of optimal adaptive and optimal nonadaptive policies—is bounded and is equal to e /( e − 1). We propose a polynomial-time nonadaptive policy that achieves this bound. We also present an adaptive myopic policy that obtains at least half of the optimal value. Furthermore, when the matroid is uniform, the myopic policy achieves the optimal approximation ratio of 1 − 1/ e . This paper was accepted by Dimitris Bertsimas and Yinyu Ye, optimization .},

abstract = {We consider the problem of maximizing a non-negative submodular set function f:2N -> RR+ over a ground set N subject to a variety of packing type constraints including (multiple) matroid constraints, knapsack constraints, and their intersections. In this paper we develop a general framework that allows us to derive a number of new results, in particular when f may be a non-monotone function. Our algorithms are based on (approximately) solving the multilinear extension F of f [5] over a polytope P that represents the constraints, and then effectively rounding the fractional solution. Although this approach has been used quite successfully in some settings [6, 22, 24, 13, 3], it has been limited in some important ways. We overcome these limitations as follows.First, we give constant factor approximation algorithms to maximize F over an arbitrary down-closed polytope P that has an efficient separation oracle. Previously this was known only for monotone functions [36]. For non-monotone functions, a constant factor was known only when the polytope was either the intersection of a fixed number of knapsack constraints [24] or a matroid polytope [37,30]. Second, we show that contention resolution schemes are an effective way to round a fractional solution, even when f is non-monotone. In particular, contention resolution schemes for different polytopes can be combined to handle the intersection of different constraints. Via LP duality we show that a contention resolution scheme for a constraint is related to the correlation gap [1] of weighted rank functions of the constraint. This leads to an optimal contention resolution scheme for the matroid polytope.Our results provide a broadly applicable framework for maximizing linear and submodular functions subject to independence constraints. We give several illustrative examples. Contention resolution schemes may find other applications.},

The weight of each edge is drawn independently from an a-priori known probability distribution. Under edge arrival, the weight of each edge is revealed upon arrival, and the algorithm decides whether to include it in the matching or not. Under vertex arrival, the weights of all edges from the newly arriving vertex to all previously arrived vertices are revealed, and the algorithm decides which of these edges, if any, to include in the matching. To study these settings, we introduce a novel unified framework of batched prophet inequalities that captures online settings where elements arrive in batches; in particular it captures matching under the two aforementioned arrival models. Our algorithms rely on the construction of suitable online contention resolution schemes (OCRS). We first extend the framework of OCRS to batched-OCRS, we then establish a reduction from batched prophet inequality to batched OCRS, and finally we construct batched OCRSs with selectable ratios of 0.337 and 0.5 for edge and vertex arrival models, respectively. Both results improve the state of the art for the corresponding settings. For vertex arrival, our result is tight. Interestingly, pricing-based prophet inequalities with comparable competitive ratios are unknown.},

Given a set of $n$ eligible candidates, the decision maker needs to choose the sequence of candidates to make offers so as to hire the $k$ best candidates. However, candidates may choose to reject an offer (for instance, due to a competing offer) and the decision maker has a time limit by which all positions must be filled. Given an estimate of the probabilities of acceptance for each candidate, the hiring under uncertainty problem is to design a strategy of making offers so that the total expected value of all candidates hired by the time limit is maximized. We provide a 2-approximation algorithm for the setting where offers must be made in sequence, an 8-approximation when offers may be made in parallel, and a 10-approximation for the more general stochastic knapsack setting with finite probes.} }

In our model for online matching, the vertices on the right-hand side of a bipartite graph are given in advance and the vertices on the left-hand side arrive online in random order. Whenever a vertex arrives, its adjacent edges with the corresponding weights are revealed and the online algorithm has to decide which of these edges should be included in the matching. The studied matching problems have applications, e.g., in online ad auctions and combinatorial auctions where the right-hand side vertices correspond to items and the left-hand side vertices to bidders.",

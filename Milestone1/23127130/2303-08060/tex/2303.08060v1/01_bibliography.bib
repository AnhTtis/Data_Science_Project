	doi = {10.1016/j.birob.2022.100047},
	abstract = {Nonprehensile multiobject rearrangement is the robotic task of planning feasible paths and transferring multiple objects to their predefined target poses without grasping. It must consider how each object reaches the target and the order in which objects move, considerably increasing the complexity of the problem. Thus, we propose a hierarchical policy for nonprehensile multiobject rearrangement based on deep-reinforcement learning. We use imitation learning and reinforcement learning to train a rollout policy. In a high-level policy, the policy network directs the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to efficiently seek the ideal rearrangement sequence for several items. In a low-level policy, the robot plans the paths according to the order of path primitives and manipulates the objects to approach the target poses one by one. Our experiments show that the proposed method has a higher success rate, fewer steps, and shorter path length than the state-of-the-art methods.},

	doi = {10.1038/s41598-019-51111-1},
	abstract = {This paper shows the application of Deep Neural Network algorithms for Fluid-Structure Topology Optimization. The strategy offered is a new concept which can be added to the current process used to study Topology Optimization with Cellular Automata, Adjoint and Level-Set methods. The design space is described by a computational grid where every cell can be in two states: fluid or solid. The system does not require human intervention and learns through an algorithm based on Deep Neural Network and Monte Carlo Tree Search. In this work the objective function for the optimization is an incompressible fluid solver but the overall optimization process is independent from the solver. The test case used is a standard duct with back facing step where the optimizer aims at minimizing the pressure losses between inlet and outlet. The results obtained with the proposed approach are compared to the solution via a classical adjoint topology optimization code.},

	title = {Discovering faster matrix multiplication algorithms with reinforcement learning.},
	volume = {610},
	issn = {0028-0836 (Print)},
	doi = {10.1038/s41586-022-05172-4},
	abstract = {Improving the efficiency of algorithms for fundamental computations can have a widespread impact, as it can affect the overall speed of a large amount of computations. Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems-from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero(1) for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4 × 4 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor's algorithm improves on Strassen's two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago(2). We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor's ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.},

@article{gauthier_deep_2020,
	title = {Deep reinforcement learning for synthesizing functions in higher-order logic},
	volume = {73},
	doi = {10.29007/7jmg},
	abstract = {The paper describes a deep reinforcement learning framework based on self-supervised learning within the proof assistant HOL4. A close interaction between the machine learning modules and the HOL4 library is achieved by the choice of tree neural networks (TNNs) as machine learning models and the internal use of HOL4 terms to represent tree structures of TNNs. Recursive improvement is possible when a task is expressed as a search problem. In this case, a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm guided by a TNN can be used to explore the search space and produce better examples for training the next TNN. As an illustration, term synthesis tasks on combinators and Diophantine equations are specified and learned. We achieve a success rate of 65\% on combinator synthesis problems outperforming state-of-the-art ATPs run with their best general set of strategies. We set a precedent for statistically guided synthesis of Diophantine equations by solving 78.5\% of the generated test problems. © 2020, EasyChair.},

	doi = {10.1002/jcc.26441},
	abstract = {Optically active small organic molecules are computationally designed using the ChemTS python library developed by Tsuda and collaborators, which utilizes a combined Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and recurrent neural network model. Geometry optimization and excited-state calculations are performed for each generated molecule, following which the excitation energy and dissymmetry factors are computed to evaluate the score function in the MCTS process. Using this procedure, molecules not contained in existing databases are generated. Molecules having either high dissymmetry factors or high transition dipole strengths can be generated depending on the choice of the score function. In a single trajectory with 100,000 trials, mutually similar high-scoring molecules are generated frequently after the initial 15,000-20,000 trials. This indicates that it is better to sample high-scoring molecules from several trajectories having a modest number of trials each than from a single trajectory having a large number of trials.},

	abstract = {In the development of advanced nanoporous materials, one clear and unavoidable challenge in hand is the sheer size (in principle, infinite) of the materials space to be explored. While high-throughput screening techniques allow us to narrow down the enormous-scale database of nanoporous materials, there are still practical limitations stemming from a costly molecular simulation in estimating a material's performance and the necessity of a sophisticated descriptor identifying materials. With an attempt to transition away from the screening-based approaches, this paper presents a computational approach combining the Monte Carlo tree search and recurrent neural networks for the tailor-made design of metal-organic frameworks toward the desired target applications. In the demonstration cases for methane-storage and carbon-capture applications, our approach showed significant efficiency in designing promising and novel metal-organic frameworks. We expect that this approach would easily be extended to other applications by simply adjusting the reward function according to the target performance property.},

	volume = {20},
	issn = {1424-8220},
	doi = {10.3390/s20247297},
	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising direction in automated parking systems (APSs), as integrating planning and tracking control using RL can potentially maximize the overall performance. However, commonly used model-free RL requires many interactions to achieve acceptable performance, and model-based RL in APS cannot continuously learn. In this paper, a data-efficient RL method is constructed to learn from data by use of a model-based method. The proposed method uses a truncated Monte Carlo tree search to evaluate parking states and select moves. Two artificial neural networks are trained to provide the search probability of each tree branch and the final reward for each state using self-trained data. The data efficiency is enhanced by weighting exploration with parking trajectory returns, an adaptive exploration scheme, and experience augmentation with imaginary rollouts. Without human demonstrations, a novel training pipeline is also used to train the initial action guidance network and the state value network. Compared with path planning and path-following methods, the proposed integrated method can flexibly co-ordinate the longitudinal and lateral motion to park a smaller parking space in one maneuver. Its adaptability to changes in the vehicle model is verified by joint Carsim and MATLAB simulation, demonstrating that the algorithm converges within a few iterations. Finally, experiments using a real vehicle platform are used to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with obtaining rewards using simulation, the proposed method achieves a better final parking attitude and success rate.},

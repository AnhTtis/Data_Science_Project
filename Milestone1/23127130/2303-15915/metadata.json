    "abstract": "A number of dense particle suspensions experience a dramatic increase in viscosity with the shear stress, up to a solid-like response. This shear-thickening process is understood as a frictionless/frictional transition between particles that repel each other. Here, we show that the emblematic shear-thickening fluid, cornstarch, does not fit into this framework. Using an original pressure sensor array, we map the normal stresses in the flow. We evidence in cornstarch a unique, stable stress wave which does not appear in a purely repulsive system (calcium carbonate). At high solid fraction and small gap, the stress signal shows a rolling aggregate, which presence is explained by adhesive contacts (associated with a hysteresis in the force profile) between two particles. Our findings offer a new perspective on the shear-thickening process of cornstarch, which is deeply connected to adhesion. As a result, experiments on cornstarch may not be generalized to other shear-thickening fluids.",

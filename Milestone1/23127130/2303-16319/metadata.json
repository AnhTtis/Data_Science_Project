    "abstract": "The full realization of spin qubits for quantum technologies relies on the ability to control and design the formation processes of spin defects in semiconductors and insulators. We present a computational protocol to investigate the synthesis of point-defects at the atomistic level, and we apply it to the study of a promising spin-qubit in silicon carbide, the divacancy (VV). Our strategy combines electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory and enhanced sampling techniques coupled with first principles molecular dynamics. We predict the optimal annealing temperatures for the formation of VVs at high temperature and show how to engineer the Fermi level of the material to optimize the defect's yield for several polytypes of silicon carbide. Our results are in excellent agreement with available experimental data and provide novel atomistic insights into point defect formation and annihilation processes as a function of temperature.",

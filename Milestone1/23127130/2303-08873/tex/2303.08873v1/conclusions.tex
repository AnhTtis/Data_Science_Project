\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed a set of new OpenMP extensions for programmers to express dynamic, machine learning-driven adaptation.
Using a producer-consumer pattern, the extensions support different types of adaptation use-cases and automate the entire workflow of model-driven adaptation, including code variant generation, performance profiling, and model building. Through a reference implementation and a set of proxy application benchmarks, we have demonstrated that our approach is both feasible and beneficial. 

In the future, we plan to expand the \code{adaptation} directive to work with more types of code variants. We will also study advanced analyses to automatically decide suitable code regions for adaptation, choices of code variants, features needed for building a model, and suitable machine learning models.

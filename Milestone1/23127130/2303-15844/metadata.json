    "abstract": "Predictive process analytics focuses on predicting future states, such as the outcome of running process instances. These techniques often use machine learning models or deep learning models (such as LSTM) to make such predictions. However, these deep models are complex and difficult for users to understand. Counterfactuals answer ``what-if'' questions, which are used to understand the reasoning behind the predictions. For example, what if instead of emailing customers, customers are being called? Would this alternative lead to a different outcome? Current methods to generate counterfactual sequences either do not take the process behavior into account, leading to generating invalid or infeasible counterfactual process instances, or heavily rely on domain knowledge. In this work, we propose a general framework that uses evolutionary methods to generate counterfactual sequences. Our framework does not require domain knowledge. Instead, we propose to train a Markov model to compute the feasibility of generated counterfactual sequences and adapt three other measures (delta in outcome prediction, similarity, and sparsity) to ensure their overall viability. The evaluation shows that we generate viable counterfactual sequences, outperform baseline methods in viability, and yield similar results when compared to the state-of-the-art method that requires domain knowledge.",

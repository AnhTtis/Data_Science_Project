abstract = {The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is one of the three arrays of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) currently in operation. It is composed of four 12-meter telescopes and a 28-meter one, and is sensitive to gamma rays in the energy range  ~ 30 GeV – 100 TeV. The cameras of the 12-m telescopes recently underwent a substantial upgrade, with the goal of improving their performance and robustness. The upgrade involved replacing all camera components except for the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). This meant developing new hardware for the trigger, readout, power, cooling and mechanical systems, and new software for camera control and data acquisition. Several novel technologies were employed in the cameras: the readout is built around the new NECTAr digitizer chip, developed for the next generation of IACTs; the camera electronics is fully controlled and read out via Ethernet using a combination of FPGA and embedded ARM computers; the software uses modern libraries such as Apache Thrift, ØMQ and Protocol buffers. This work describes in detail the design and the performance of the upgraded cameras.}

abstract = {The Earth’s atmosphere is an integral part of the detector in ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT) experiments and has to be taken into account in the calibration. Atmospheric and hardware-related deviations from simulated conditions can result in the mis-reconstruction of primary particle energies and therefore of source spectra. During the eight years of observations with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in Namibia, the overall yield in Cherenkov photons has varied strongly with time due to gradual hardware aging, together with adjustments of the hardware components, and natural, as well as anthropogenic, variations of the atmospheric transparency. Here we present robust data selection criteria that minimize these effects over the full data set of the H.E.S.S. experiment and introduce the Cherenkov transparency coefficient as a new atmospheric monitoring quantity. The influence of atmospheric transparency, as quantified by this coefficient, on energy reconstruction and spectral parameters is examined and its correlation with the aerosol optical depth (AOD) of independent MISR satellite measurements and local measurements of atmospheric clarity is investigated.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {Aerosol levels influence the wavelength dependent transmission properties of the atmosphere. Variations in aerosol levels therefore affect the amount of Cherenkov light from air-showers that can reach an atmospheric Cherenkov detector. As the amount of detected Cherenkov light is directly related to a primary shower particle’s energy, deviations between actual and assumed atmospheric transmission properties yield errors in reconstructed particle energies as well as energy axes of instrument response functions. In this work, a scheme is presented to assess this influence and potentially reduce related errors in the air-shower reconstruction. The proposed scheme relies on estimations or measurements of the aerosol optical depth and atmospheric density profile which are then used in radiative transfer simulations to generate atmospheric transmission profiles. As the scheme furthermore uses detector specific quantum efficiencies and generalised shower evolution models, it does not rely on detailed Monte Carlo simulations for the different atmospheric conditions but only on the transmission profile which the initial shower reconstruction algorithm is based on. The approach is derived and presented on the example of the H.E.S.S. experiment which employs imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes in the Khomas Highland of Namibia to detect gamma rays in the GeV to TeV energy range.}

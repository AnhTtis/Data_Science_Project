    "abstract": "Involving integrated development environments (IDEs) in introductory-level (CS1) programming courses is critical. However, it is difficult for instructors to find a suitable IDE that is beginner friendly and supports strong functionality. In this paper, we report the experience of using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) in a CS1 programming course. We describe our motivation for choosing VS Code and how we introduce it to students. We create comprehensive guidance with hierarchical indexing to help students with diverse programming backgrounds. We perform an experimental evaluation of students' programming experience of using VS Code and validate the VS Code together with guidance as a promising solution for CS1 programming courses.",

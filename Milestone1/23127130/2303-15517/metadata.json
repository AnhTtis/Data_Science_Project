    "abstract": "Place an active particle at the root of a $d$-ary tree and a single dormant particle at each non-root site. In discrete time, active particles move towards the root with probability $p$ and, otherwise, away from the root to a uniformly sampled child vertex. When an active particle moves to a site containing a dormant particle, the dormant particle becomes active. The critical drift $p_d$ is the infimum over all $p$ for which infinitely many particles visit the root almost surely. Guo, Tang, and Wei proved that $\\sup_{d\\geq 3} p_d \\leq 1/3$. We improve this bound to $5/17$ with a shorter argument that generalizes to give bounds on $\\sup_{d \\geq m} p_d$. We additionally prove that $\\limsup p_d \\leq 1/6$ by finding the limiting critical drift for a non-backtracking variant.",

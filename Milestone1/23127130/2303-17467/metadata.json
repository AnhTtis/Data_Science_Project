    "abstract": "We continue the study of the B-Toda hierarchy (the Toda lattice with the constraint of type B) which can be regarded as a discretization of the BKP hierarchy. We introduce the tau-function of the B-Toda hierarchy and obtain the bilinear equations for it. Examples of soliton tau-functions are presented in the explicit form.",

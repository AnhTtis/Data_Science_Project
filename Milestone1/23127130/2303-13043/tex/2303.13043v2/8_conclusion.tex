\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We consider top-down attention by explaining from an Analysis-by-Synthesis (AbS) view of vision. Starting from previous work on the functional equivalence between visual attention and sparse reconstruction, we show that AbS optimizes a similar sparse reconstruction objective but modulates it with a goal-directed top-down modulation, thus simulating top-down attention. We propose \model, a top-down modulated ViT model that variationally approximates AbS. We show that \model achieves controllable top-down attention and improves over baselines on V\&L tasks as well as image classification and robustness.

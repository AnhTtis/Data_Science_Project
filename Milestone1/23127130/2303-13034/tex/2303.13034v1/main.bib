  abstract = 	 {Bayesian optimization methods are promising for the optimization of black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate. In this paper, a novel batch Bayesian optimization approach is proposed. The parallelization is realized via a multi-objective ensemble of multiple acquisition functions. In each iteration, the multi-objective optimization of the multiple acquisition functions is performed to search for the Pareto front of the acquisition functions. The batch of inputs are then selected from the Pareto front. The Pareto front represents the best trade-off between the multiple acquisition functions. Such a policy for batch Bayesian optimization can significantly improve the efficiency of optimization. The proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art batch Bayesian optimization algorithms using analytical benchmark functions and real-world analog integrated circuits. The experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

abstract = {The hypervolume indicator is a set measure used in evolutionary multiobjective optimization to evaluate the performance of search algorithms and to guide the search. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms using the hypervolume indicator transform multiobjective problems into single objective ones by searching for a finite set of solutions maximizing the corresponding hypervolume indicator. In this paper, we theoretically investigate how those optimal μ--distributions-finite sets of μ solutions maximizing the hypervolume indicator-are spread over the Pareto front of biobjective problems. This problem is of high importance for practical applications as these sets characterize the preferences that the hypervolume indicator encodes, i.e., which types of Pareto set approximations are favored.In particular, we tackle the question whether the hypervolume indicator is biased towards certain regions. For linear fronts we prove that the distribution is uniform with constant distance between two consecutive points. For general fronts where it is presumably impossible to characterize exactly the distribution, we derive a limit result when the number of points grows to infinity proving that the empirical density of points converges to a density proportional to the square root of the negative of the derivative of the front. Our analyses show that it is not the shape of the Pareto front but only its slope that determines how the points that maximize the hypervolume indicator are distributed. Experimental results illustrate that the limit density is a good approximation of the empirical density for small μ. Furthermore, we analyze the issue of where to place the reference point of the indicator such that the extremes of the front can be found if the hypervolume indicator is optimized. We derive an explicit lower bound (possibly infinite) ensuring the presence of the extremes in the optimal distribution. This result contradicts the common belief that the reference point has to be chosen close to the nadir point: for certain types of fronts, we show that no finite reference point allows to have the extremes in the optimal μ-distribution.},

abstract = {Among various time series (TS) forecasting methods, ensemble forecast is extensively acknowledged as a promising ensemble approach achieving great success in research and industry. Due to the high diversification of individual model assumptions, heterogeneous information fusion contributes to generating effective and robust forecasts for Economics, Meteorology, and Transportation. This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization-based dynamic ensemble (BODE) that overcomes the single model-based methods limitation and provides a dynamic ensemble forecast combination for TS with time-varying underlying patterns. The proposed BODE method combines ten disparate model candidates, including statistical methods, machine learning (ML)-based models, and the latest deep neural networks (DNN). We take into consideration their prediction performance for the recent past to adjust their weights for combination and apply the model-based Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) for the combination hyperparameter (HP) tuning to endow our method with higher adaptability and better generalization performance. Besides, the frequency impact of TS data on the ensemble forecast methods is under-researched in the current literature. Therefore, four groups of distinct seasonal TS datasets are investigated in this paper. The empirical result demonstrates that our method performs robustly better performance with the main reasons analyzed in a detailed ablation study.}

  abstract = 	 {We consider the problem of optimizing hybrid structures (mixture of discrete and continuous input variables) via expensive black-box function evaluations. This problem arises in many real-world applications. For example, in materials design optimization via lab experiments, discrete and continuous variables correspond to the presence/absence of primitive elements and their relative concentrations respectively. The key challenge is to accurately model the complex interactions between discrete and continuous variables. In this paper, we propose a novel approach referred as Hybrid Bayesian Optimization (HyBO) by utilizing diffusion kernels, which are naturally defined over continuous and discrete variables. We develop a principled approach for constructing diffusion kernels over hybrid spaces by utilizing the additive kernel formulation, which allows additive interactions of all orders in a tractable manner. We theoretically analyze the modeling strength of additive hybrid kernels and prove that it has the universal approximation property. Our experiments on synthetic and six diverse real-world benchmarks show that HyBO significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {Bayesian optimization has been successfully introduced to analog circuit synthesis recently. Since the evaluations of performances are computational expensive, batch Bayesian optimization has been proposed to run simulations in parallel. However, circuit simulations may fail during the optimization, due to the improper design variables. In such cases, Bayesian optimization methods may have poor performance. In this paper, we propose a Robust Batch Bayesian Optimization approach (RBBO) for analog circuit synthesis. Local penalization (LP) is used to capture the local repulsion between query points in one batch. The diversity of the query points can thus be guaranteed. The failed points and their neighborhoods can also be excluded by LP. Moreover, we propose an Adaptive Local Penalization (ALP) strategy to adaptively scale the penalized areas to improve the convergence of our proposed RBBO method. The proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms with several practical analog circuits. The experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Hyperparameters are important for machine learning algorithms since they directly control the behaviors of training algorithms and have a significant effect on the performance of machine learning models. Several techniques have been developed and successfully applied for certain application domains. However, this work demands professional knowledge and expert experience. And sometimes it has to resort to the brute-force search. Therefore, if an efficient hyperparameter optimization algorithm can be developed to optimize any given machine learning method, it will greatly improve the efficiency of machine learning. In this paper, we consider building the relationship between the performance of the machine learning models and their hyperparameters by Gaussian processes. In this way, the hyperparameter tuning problem can be abstracted as an optimization problem and Bayesian optimization is used to solve the problem. Bayesian optimization is based on the Bayesian theorem. It sets a prior over the optimization function and gathers the information from the previous sample to update the posterior of the optimization function. A utility function selects the next sample point to maximize the optimization function. Several experiments were conducted on standard test datasets. Experiment results show that the proposed method can find the best hyperparameters for the widely used machine learning models, such as the random forest algorithm and the neural networks, even multi-grained cascade forest under the consideration of time cost.}

abstract = {This work presents a new software, programmed as a Python class, that implements a multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm. The proposed method is able to calculate the Pareto front approximation of optimization problems with fewer objective functions evaluations than other methods, which makes it appropriate for costly objectives. The software was extensively tested on benchmark functions for optimization, and it was able to obtain Pareto Function approximations for the benchmarks with as many as 20 objective function evaluations, those results were obtained for problems with different dimensionalities and constraints.}

    "abstract": "CLLBC(Ce) and TLYC(Ce) are novel scintillation materials capable of measuring mixed gamma ray and neutron radiation fields that have gained significant interest in the areas of space and nuclear safety/security science. To date Geant4, the world's most popular Monte Carlo radiation modelling toolkit, has yet to be effectively used to simulate the full response of these materials when coupled to near ultra-violet Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPMs). In this work an experimentally validated Geant4 application has been developed with optimised material composition, optical data tables, and physics transport settings that is able to accurately simulate the response of CLLBC(Ce) and TLYC(Ce) SiPM-based radiation detectors under both gamma ray and neutron irradiation. Experimental benchmarking for five different radioactive sources (Co-60, Cs-137, Eu-152, Am-241, and Cf-252) illustrated that this developed Geant4 application was able to reproduce the position and structure of all major spectral features (full energy gamma ray photo-/neutron capture peaks, X-ray escape photopeaks, Compton edge, Compton backscatter peaks, and Compton plateau) to high level of accuracy.",

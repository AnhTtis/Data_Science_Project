\section{Conclusion}
A lossless PCAC that extensively exploits cross-scale, cross-group and cross-color correlations is developed to accurately approximate attribute probability for high-efficiency compression. The proposed method improves the latest G-PCC with significant bitrate reduction for a variety of diverse point clouds. In the meantime, the computational complexity measured by the encoding/decoding runtime reports the same order of magnitude as that of the G-PCC, which is lightweight and attractive for practical applications. One interesting topic for future exploration is the support of lossy compression under the same framework.

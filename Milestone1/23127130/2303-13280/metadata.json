    "abstract": "In the context of $\\rm AdS_3/CFT_2$, we investigate holographic correlators of the stress tensor of a conformal field theory (CFT) on a torus in this work. To calculate the correlators of the stress tensor, we employ the Einstein-Hilbert theory of gravity and perturbatively solve Einstein's equation in the bulk. We offer an explicit prescription to develop a recurrence relation that makes it simple to compute higher point correlators. The correlators and the recurrence relation are found to be consistent with what is known in CFTs. Following the spirit of the proposed cutoff $\\rm AdS$/$T\\bar{T}$ CFT holography, we then expand our computation program to investigate holographic torus correlators at a finite cutoff in the $\\rm AdS_3$. A parallel recurrence relation associated with higher point correlators can be obtained.",

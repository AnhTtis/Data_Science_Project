    "abstract": "Invariant geodesic orbit Finsler $(α,β)$ metrics which arise from Riemannian geodesic orbit metrics $α$ on spheres are determined. The relation of Riemannian geodesic graphs with Finslerian geodesic graphs proved in a previous work is now illustrated with explicit constructions. Interesting examples are found such that $(G/H,α)$ is Riemannian geodesic orbit space, but for the geodesic orbit property of $(G/H,F)$ the isometry group has to be extended. It is also shown that standard projective spaces which are Riemannian geodesic orbit spaces do not admit invariant purely Finsler $(α,β)$ metrics.",

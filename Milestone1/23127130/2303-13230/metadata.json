    "abstract": "This article studies three-dimensional objects and their volumes in Elamite mathematics, particularly those found in the Susa Mathematical Tablet No.\\,14 (\\textbf{SMT No.\\,14}). In our discussion, we identify some basic solids whose volumes have been correctly computed in Babylonian and Elamite mathematics. We also show that the Elamite scribes knew the right formula for calculating the volume of a certain pyramid which is a rare phenomenon occurring in the Babylonian mathematical tablets.",

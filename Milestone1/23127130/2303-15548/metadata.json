    "abstract": "With the rapid development of quantum technologies in recent years, the need for high sensitivity measuring techniques has become a key issue. In particular, optical sensors based on quantum states of light have proven to be optimal resources for high precision interferometry. Nevertheless, their performance may be severely affected by the presence of noise or imperfections. In this work we derive the quantum Fisher information matrix associated to the simultaneous estimation of an interferometric phase and the indistinguishability characterizing the probe state consisting of an even number of photons. We find the optimal measurement attaining the ultimate precision for both parameters in a single setup and perform an experiment based on a pair of photons with an unknown degree of indistinguishability entering a two-port interferometer.",

    "abstract": "It is a classical result that any monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict one, called its strictification. In this paper, we prove that any monoidal category is also monoidally equivalent to a non-strict monoidal category, called its non-strictification. Furthermore, we show that these two constructions give the free (non-)strict monoidal category generated by a monoidal category. Moreover, we prove in detail that these two constructions are part of a pair of free-forgetful 2-adjunctions.",

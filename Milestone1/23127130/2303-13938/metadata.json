    "abstract": "This study compares the National Cybersecurity Strategies (NCSSs) of publicly available documents of ten nations across Europe (United Kingdom, France, Lithuania, Estonia, Spain, and Norway), Asia-Pacific (Singapore and Australia), and the American region (the United States of America and Canada). The study observed that there is not a unified understanding of the term \"Cybersecurity\"; however, a common trajectory of the NCSSs shows that the fight against cybercrime is a joint effort among various stakeholders, hence the need for strong international cooperation. Using a comparative structure and an NCSS framework, the research finds similarities in protecting critical assets, commitment to research and development, and improved national and international collaboration. The study finds that the lack of a unified underlying cybersecurity framework leads to a disparity in the structure and contents of the strategies. The strengths and weaknesses of the NCSSs from the research can benefit countries planning to develop or update their cybersecurity strategies. The study gives recommendations that strategy developers can consider when developing an NCSS.",

    "abstract": "A key goal of freeform manufacturing is to achieve speed, precision and design freedom at the same time. Volumetric additive manufacturing via tomographic reconstruction offers high speed but cannot achieve optical resolution at high design freedom. Here we combine polyspectral tomographic reconstruction with pseudo-negative illumination to resolve the trilemma. We used the same units on a digital micromirror device to modulate two colors of illumination simultaneously to control the chemical stability of binary photoinhibition. The methodology enables a typical 4K projector to 3D-print up to 8.9 billion voxels in a 30x30x50 mm vial at two-digit-m-resolution in minutes, with prolonged process window and geometrically fidelous greyscale printing. These results are linked to, and thus can be improved directly upon upgrading, the precision of the optomechanical modality.",

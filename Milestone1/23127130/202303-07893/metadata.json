    "abstract": "The well-rounded retract for $\\mathrm{SL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})$ is defined as the\nset of flat tori of unit volume and dimension $n$ whose systoles generate a\nfinite-index subgroup in homology. This set forms an equivariant spine of\nminimal dimension for the space of flat tori.\n  For both the Outer space $X_n$ of metric graphs of rank $n$ and the\nTeichm\\\"uller space $\\mathcal{T}_g$ of closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$,\nwe show that the literal analogue of the well-rounded retract does not contain\nan equivariant spine. We also prove that the set of graphs whose systoles fill\n(the analogue of a set proposed as a spine for $\\mathcal{T}_g$ by Thurston) is\na spine for $X_n$ but that its dimension is larger than the virtual\ncohomological dimension of $\\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ in general.",

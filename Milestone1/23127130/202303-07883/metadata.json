    "abstract": "The parity conjecture has a long and distinguished history. It gives a way of\npredicting the existence of points of infinite order on elliptic curves without\nhaving to construct them, and is responsible for a wide range of unexplained\narithmetic phenomena. It is one of the main consequences of the Birch and\nSwinnerton-Dyer conjecture and lets one calculate the parity of the rank of an\nelliptic curve using root numbers. In this handbook, we explain how to use\nlocal root numbers of elliptic curves to realise some of these phenomena, with\nan emphasis on explicit calculations. The text is aimed at a `user' and, as\nsuch, we will not be concerned with the proofs of known cases of the parity\nconjecture, but instead we will demonstrate the use of the theory by means of\nexamples.",

In photon-assisted electron transport it is often only the dc component of the current that is of experimental interest. But ac currents at all frequencies exist independently of whether they are measured or not. We present a theory of photon-assisted electron transport which is charge and current conserving for all Fourier components of the current. We find that the photocurrent can be considered as an up and down conversion of the harmonic potentials associated with the displacement currents. As an example explicit calculations are presented for a resonant double barrier coupled to two reservoirs and capacitively coupled to a gate. Two experimental situations are considered: in the first case the ac field is applied via a gate, and in the second case one of the contact potentials is modulated. For the first case we show that the relative weight of the conduction sidebands varies with the screening properties of the system. This is in contrast to the noninteracting case in which one finds that the relative weights are a universal function determined by Bessel functions. Moreover, interactions can give rise to an asymmetry between absorption and emission peaks. In the contact-driven case, the theory predicts at zero bias a photocurrent proportional to the asymmetry of the double barrier.}},

In particular, shot noise experiments can determine the charge and statistics of the quasiparticles relevant for transport, and reveal information on the potential profile and internal energy scales of mesoscopic systems. Shot noise is generally more sensitive to the effects of electron–electron interactions than the average conductance. We present a discussion based on the conceptually transparent scattering approach and on the classical Langevin and Boltzmann–Langevin methods; in addition a discussion of results which cannot be obtained by these methods is provided.

For a perfectly transmitting channel the counting distribution is Gaussian, both for zero‐point fluctuations and at finite temperature. At constant bias and low temperature the distribution is binomial, i.e., it arises from Bernoulli statistics.

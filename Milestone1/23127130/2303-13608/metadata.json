    "abstract": "Genetic information is encoded in a linear sequence of nucleotides, represented by letters ranging from thousands to billions. Mutations refer to changes in the DNA or RNA nucleotide sequence. Thus, mutation detection is vital in all areas of biology and medicine. Careful monitoring of virulence-enhancing mutations is essential. However, an enormous amount of classical computing power is required to analyze genetic sequences of this size. Inspired by human perception of vision and pixel representation of images on quantum computers, we leverage these techniques to implement a pairwise sequence analysis. The methodology has a potential advantage over classical approaches and can be further applied to identify mutations and other modifications in genetic sequences. We present a method to display and analyze the similarity between two genome sequences on a quantum computer where a similarity score is calculated to determine the similarity between nucleotides.",

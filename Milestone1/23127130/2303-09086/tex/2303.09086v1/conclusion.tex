\section{Conclusion}\label{sec_discuss}

This work considered controlling diffusion processes on weighted graphs.
We study minimizing the largest eigenvalues of the graph and design an efficient algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum.
%Each iteration runs a greedy edge selection procedure and then updates the eigenscores of the edges.
We observe a connection between edge centrality scores and gradients, which provides a new way to derive graph spectral optimization algorithms.
We show how to derive them for static and time-varying networks.
Experiments show that our algorithms are effective on various epidemic models and weighted graphs.
%Our result highlights the importance of studying spectral properties with mobility networks and shows how to use the spectral properties from an optimization perspective.

%We remark that implementing this scheme requires knowing the network in the sequence. When such information is not available, one needs first to  estimate this information. This is left for future work.
We mention two open questions for future work.
First, it would be interesting to understand better the metapopulation SEIR model of \citet{chang2021mobility} such as its epidemic threshold.
Second, it would be interesting to understand better how eigenvalues affect the diffusion process besides $\lambda_1$. % We leave it for future work.
We hope our work inspires further algorithmic and theoretical studies about epidemics.

%\subsection{Performance baseline} \label{5a}

There is a need to establish a starting point for comparison and therefore we implemented a benchmark to identify the maximum potential performance improvement that could be achieved by replacing the current implementations with more performant alternatives. The benchmark implements chaincode FixedAsset with two methods, one which results in interaction between the peer and the StateDB and the other which does not. 

Let's examine the total impact of StateDB on HLF performance using StateDB goleveldb, as it was shown that it outperforms CouchDB~\cite{l68}. For this, a number of performance benchmarks were been run.

We can conclude that reading 100 byte values in transactions from StateDB has essentially no impact on HLF performance compared to writing the same values to StateDB based on the findings of comparing the average TPS in Fig.\ref{pic6}.

As a result, in this study, we gave top importance to enhancing StateDB's write performance.

The concept of channels is brought into play by Fabric architecture to facilitate improved data segregation, which protects users' privacy and enables 
sharding, alleviating scalability issues. In addition, the information may be safely traded between consortium members through the channel formed by 
the parties who have organized themselves into a consortium. Channels are a straightforward abstraction of the private blockchain instance's ledger 
management, smart contract administration, and other features. The nodes that participate in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network typically 
fulfill one of the following three roles: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The business application code is tasked with coordinating the flow of transaction processing, and it typically 
uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the Hyperledger Fabric.  
\item The endorsing and committing peers are responsible for managing the state, validating transactions, and 
providing attestation of agreement of transaction execution results .
\item Ordering service instituting atomic broadcast abstraction to carry out consensus protocol, 
which is used to group client transactions into blocks and guarantee total order between all transactions.
\end{itemize}

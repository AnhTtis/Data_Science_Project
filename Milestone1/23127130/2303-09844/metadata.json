    "abstract": "Rydberg excitons, the solid-state counterparts of Rydberg atoms, have sparked considerable interest in harnessing their quantum application potentials, whereas a major challenge is realizing their spatial confinement and manipulation. Lately, the rise of two-dimensional moiré superlattices with highly tunable periodic potentials provides a possible pathway. Here, we experimentally demonstrate this capability through the observation of Rydberg moiré excitons (XRM), which are moiré trapped Rydberg excitons in monolayer semiconductor WSe2 adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene. In the strong coupling regime, the XRM manifest as multiple energy splittings, pronounced redshift, and narrowed linewidth in the reflectance spectra, highlighting their charge-transfer character where electron-hole separation is enforced by the strongly asymmetric interlayer Coulomb interactions. Our findings pave the way for pursuing novel physics and quantum technology exploitation based on the excitonic Rydberg states.",

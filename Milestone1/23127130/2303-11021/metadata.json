    "abstract": "A novel perspective on the design of robust model predictive control (MPC) methods is presented, whereby closed-loop constraint satisfaction is ensured using recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for recursive feasibility, based on the effects of model perturbations and disturbances occurring at one time step. Using these conditions and Farkas' lemma, sufficient conditions suitable for design are formulated. The proposed method is called a closed-loop design, as only the existence of feasible inputs at the next time step is enforced by design. This is in contrast to most existing formulations, which compute control policies that are feasible under the worst-case realizations of all model perturbations and exogenous disturbances in the MPC prediction horizon. The proposed method has an online computational complexity similar to nominal MPC methods while preserving guarantees of constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility and stability. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.",

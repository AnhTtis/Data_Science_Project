\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
Both the questionnaire and direct measurements support the external HMI increases the pedestrian confidence and also leads to an earlier crossing event. On the other hand, in the questionnaire participants do not express greater confidence in gentle braking maneuver compared to aggressive braking maneuver without the activation of the external HMI. We suggest that the participants above all claim to feel safer activating the external HMI due to its high visibility in the virtual scenario, although the gentle braking maneuver also entails an earlier crossing event. 


As future work, more results are expected from comparing the same study on the real scenario \cite{Izquierdo2023}. The final goal is to verify that the \emph{behavioral gap} is not critical, so it is possible to include real behaviors in simulations through our proposal of a fully immersive virtual reality system \cite{CarlaCHIRA} for vulnerable road users in the context of autonomous driving research.

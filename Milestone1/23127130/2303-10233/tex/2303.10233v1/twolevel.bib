	abstract = { Generalized eigenvalue problems involving a singular pencil are very challenging to solve, with respect to both accuracy and efficiency. The existing package Guptri is very elegant but may be time-demanding, even for small and medium-sized matrices. We propose a simple method to compute the eigenvalues of singular pencils, based on one perturbation of the original problem of a certain specific rank. For many problems, the method is both fast and robust. This approach may be seen as a welcome alternative to staircase methods. },

@article{SiSi11,
	abstract = {We discuss the design and implementation of a suite of functions for solving symmetric indefinite linear systems associated with mixed approximation of systems of PDEs. The novel feature of our iterative solver is the incorporation of error control in the natural ``energy'' norm in combination with an a posteriori estimator for the PDE approximation error. This leads to a robust and optimally efficient stopping criterion: the iteration is terminated as soon as the algebraic error is insignificant compared to the approximation error. We describe a ``proof of concept'' MATLAB implementation of this algorithm, which we call EST_MINRES, and we illustrate its effectiveness when integrated into the Incompressible Flow Iterative Solution Software (IFISS) package (cf. ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software 33, Article 14, 2007).},

@article{Wath87,
	abstract = {{In time-dependent finite-element calculations, a mass matrix naturally arises. To avoid the solution of the corresponding algebraic equation system at each time step, `mass lumping' is widely used, even though this pragmatic diagonalization of the mass matrix often reduces accuracy.We show how the unassembled form of finite-element equations can be used to establish (in an element-by-element manner) realistic upper and lower bounds on the eigenvalues of the fully consistent mass matrix when preconditioned by its diagonal entries. We use this technique to give specific results for a number of different types of finite elements in one, two, and three dimensions. The bounds are found by independent calculations on the elements, and, for certain element types, are independent of mesh irregularity. We give examples of when some of the bounds are attained.These results indicate that the preconditioned conjugate-gradient method is appropriate and very rapid for the solution of Galerkin mass-matrix equations.}},

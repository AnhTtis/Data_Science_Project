	\section{Introduction}
	
	Let $R$ be a local regular ring with the fraction field $K$, $Q$ be a non-degenerate quadratic form over $R$ and $c$ in $R$ be an invertible element.
%Fix some non-degenerate quadratic form $Q$ over $R$ together with some invertible element $c$ in $R$. The
In (1977, \cite{C-T})
Colliot--Th\'{e}l\`{e}ne conjectured that the equation $Q=c$ has a solution over $R$ if and only if it has a solution over the field $K$.\\\\
In (\cite{P0}, 2009) I.A. Panin proved this conjecture for the case when $R$ contains the field of rational numbers. That proof was based
on a moving lemma for Levine--Morel's algebraic cobordism. Later, together with K.I. Pimenov he extended this result to the case when $R$
contains an arbitrary infinite field (\cite{PP1}, \cite{PP2}). The proof in \cite{PP1} still used a sofisticated tool. Namely,
it used the Gabber version of the de Jong theorem on alteration. The proof in \cite{PP2} is quite "elementary". It could be discovered
right after the paper \cite{OP}. However in all these papers the base field is supposed to be infinite.\\\\
Only in Scully's paper (2018,\cite{Sc}) the conjecture was proved for all regular local ring containing a field
(particularly, containing a finite field).
{\it Thus, the conjecture is solved in positive for all $R$ containing a field.
}\\\\
What is known about the conjecture in the mixed characteristic case?
Very little.
There is a resent Panin's result in \cite[Section 7]{P4}. However these results are obtained
under rather strong assumptions on $R$. Namely, $R$ is the local ring of an $A$-smooth scheme $X$
satisfying the $A$-relative {\it Noether Normalization Lemma}.\\\\
Also there is \cite[Corollary 3.3]{P5} where the conjecture is settled for any unramified $R$ under the assumption 
that the form 
$Q$ is a two-fold Pfister form.\\\\
{\it The goal of the present preprint paper is to extend the mentioned result
\cite[Corollary 3.3]{P5} to arbitrary Pfister forms (in the mixed characteristic case)}. \\\\
%%%result even further to the case of $R$ having mixed characteristic.
Our main result is the following theorem:
let $R$ be a regular local ring of a mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ where $p\neq 2$ is a prime number.
Suppose that the quotient ring $R/pR$ is also regular. Fix a non-degenerate Pfister form $Q(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^{m}})$ over $R$
and an invertible element $c$ in $R$. Then the equation $Q(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^{m}})=c$ has a solution over $R$
if and only if it has a solution over the fraction field $K$. 
This result is proved in the present preprint under the assumption that the residue field is infinite. 
However this result 
{\it remains true even without this assumption}. 
The latter will be proved in our next preprint using 
the main result due to Scully [Sc]. \\\\
Here is a sketch of the proof: assume that the equation $Q=c$ has a solution over $K$. It yields that for certain auxiliary Pfister form
$\widetilde{Q}$ over $R$, constructed from pair $(Q,c)$, is isotopic over $K$. Since $\widetilde{Q}_{K}$ is a Pfister form
this yields it is hyperbolic over $K$. According to the recent result of Cesnavicius \cite[Corollary 9.6]{C}.
the form $\widetilde{Q}$ is also hyperbolic over $R$. Using now the key geometric theorem formulated below, we conclude the proof.\\\\
Here is the mentioned 
{\it key geometric theorem}: 
let $M$ be a free module over a local ring $R$ of rank $2n$ with a fixed non-degenerate quadratic form $Q$
and let $N$ be its free direct summand of rank $n+1$ such that the restriction $Q|_{N}$ is also non-degenerate.
Then $N$ containes a unimodular isotopic vector. The most basic case of this theorem discussed in section~\ref{sec:vect}
is when $R$ coincides with some algebraically closed field $k$. Generally by $k$ we denote the residue field $R/\mathfrak{m}R$ of a local ring $R$.\\\\
All over the preprint the characteristic of various fields $k$ is not 2.\\\\
The paper is organized as follows. Sections~\ref{sec:vect} and~\ref{sec:mod} contain
the proof of the key geometric theorem for the cases of a vector space over the residue field $k:=R/\mathfrak{m}R$ of a local ring $R$
and a free module over the local ring $R$ respectively. Section~\ref{sec:main} contains the proof of the main result.\\\\

	\section{The case of a vector space}\label{sec:vect}
	
	Let $V$ be a vector space of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ over an algebraicaly closed field $k$ ($char(k)\neq2$). 
For each $j\leqslant n$ denote by $X^{V}_{j}$ the projective variety of complete flags of length $j$ in $V$. In particular, for $j=1$ this variety  coincides with the projective space $\mathbb{P}(V)$ and therefore has dimension $n-1$. There exists a natural surjective morphism
	$$
	\pi_{j}=X^{V}_{j}\twoheadrightarrow X^{V}_{j-1}\,, \, \, \{L_{j}\supset\ldots\supset L_{1}\}\to\{L_{j-1}\supset\ldots\supset L_{1}\}\,.
	$$
Note that its fibre over a point $\widetilde{L}:=\{L_{j-1}\supset\ldots\supset L_{1}\}\in X^{V}_{j-1}$ is naturally isomorphic to the projectivisation $\mathbb{P}(V/L_{j-1})$ of the quotient vector space $V/L_{j-1}$ of dimension $n-j+1$. Thus the dimention of $\pi^{-1}(\widetilde{L})$ is equal to $n-j$. Using theorem of dimention of fibres and applying the induction by $j$ we get the following equality:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dimX}
	dim(X^{V}_{j})=(n-1)+\ldots+(n-j)=nj-\dfrac{j(j+1)}{2}\,.
\end{equation}

Now suppose that $n\geqslant2$ and fix some non-degenerate quadratic form $Q$ on $V$. We say that a flag is totally isotopic if each of its subspaces is a totally isotopic subspace over $Q$ (note that such a subspace cannot be more than $\Large[\frac{n}{2}\Large]$-dimensional). We denote by $\mathring{X}^{V}_{j}$ the projective variety of complete totally isotopic flags of length $j$. There is an obvious closed embedding $\mathring{X}^{V}_{j}\hookrightarrow X^{V}_{j}$ that in case of $j=1$ associates $\mathring{X}^{V}_{1}$ with a hyperplane in $X^{V}_{1}\cong\mathbb{P}(V)$ defined by the equation $Q(v)=0$. Consequently $\mathring{X}^{V}_{1}$ has dimension $n-2$.

As in case of $X^{V}_{j}$  here existis a natural morphism
$$
\tau_{j}=\mathring{X}^{V}_{j}\twoheadrightarrow\mathring{X}^{V}_{j-1}\,, \, \, \{L_{j}\supset\ldots\supset L_{1}\}\to\{L_{j-1}\supset\ldots\supset L_{1}\}\,,
$$

 which is also surjective according to the Witt's theorem. Its fibre over a point $\widetilde{L}:=\{L_{j-1}\supset\ldots\supset L_{1}\}$ is isomorphic to the projective variety of all totally isotopic $j$-dimensional subspaces of $V$ that contain $L_{j-1}$. By definition any subspace of such kind belongs to $L_{j-1}^{\perp}$, therefore one can identify the $\tau_{j}^{-1}(L)$ with a hyperplane in $\mathbb{P}(L_{j-1}^{\perp}/L_{j-1})$ defined by the equation $\overline{Q}(v)=0$. Thus the dimention of $\tau_{j}^{-1}(L)$ is equal to $n-2(j-1)-2=n-2j$.  Using theorem of dimension of fibres and applying the induction by $j$ we get the following equality:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dimXo}
	dim(\mathring{X}^{V}_{j})=(n-2)+\dots+(n-2j)=nj-j(j+1)\,.
\end{equation}

Finally denote by $\mathring{Y}^{V}_{j}$ the projective variety of all totally isotopic $j$-dimensional subspaces in $V$. One can define a surjective morphism
$$
\gamma_{j}=\mathring{X}^{V}_{j}\twoheadrightarrow\mathring{Y}^{V}_{j}\,, \, \, \{L_{j}\supset\ldots\supset L_{1}\}\to L_{j}\,,
$$
which fibre over a totally isotopic subspace $L$ in $V$ is naturally isomorphic to $X^{L}_{j-1}$. Thus, according to formula~\ref{eq:dimX} there is an equality
$$
dim(X^{L}_{j-1})=j(j-1)-\dfrac{j(j-1)}{2}=\dfrac{j(j-1)}{2}\,.
$$
Applying theorem of dimension of fibres we get an equality
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dimYo}
	dim(\mathring{Y}^{V}_{j})=nj-j(j+1)-\dfrac{j(j-1)}{2}\,.
\end{equation}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:vect}
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field.
Let  $V$ be a $2n$-dimensional $k$-vector space equipped with a hyperbolic form $Q$. 
Let $P\subset V$ be a $n+1$-dimensional subspace
%%%Suppose that there is some $n+1$-dimensional subspace 
such that the restriction $Q|_{P}$ is non-degenerate. Then there exists a totally isotopic $n$-dimensional subspace $W\subset V$ such that $dim(P\cap W)=1$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	According to formula ~\ref{eq:dimYo} the dimension of the projective variety $\mathring{Y}^{V}_{n}$ of all totally isotopic $n$-dimensional subspaces $W\subset V$ is equal to
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:dimYon}
		dim(\mathring{Y}^{V}_{n})=2n^{2}-n(n+1)- \dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}=n^{2}-n-\dfrac{n^{2}-n}{2}=\dfrac{n^{2}-n}{2}\,.
	\end{equation}	
	For any $j\leqslant n$ denote by $Z_{j}$ the projective variety of all totally isotopic $n$-dimensional subspaces $W\subset V$ such that $dim(W\cap P)=j$. There is an obvious disjoint decomposition
	$$
	\mathring{Y}^{V}_{n}=Z_{1}\sqcup\dots\sqcup Z_{\large[\frac{n+1}{2}\large]}\,.
	$$
	For any $j\leqslant\large[\frac{n+1}{2}\large]$ there exists a natural morphism
	$$
	\lambda_{j}:Z_{j}\rightarrow\mathring{Y}^{P}_{j}\,,\,\,W\to P\cap W\,,
	$$
	which is surjective according to Witt's theorem. Its fibre $\lambda_{j}^{-1}(U)$ over a point $U\in\mathring{Y}^{P}_{j}$ coincides with a set
	$$
	\{W\subset V|\, dim(W)=n,\, Q|_{W}\equiv0,\, W\cap P=U\}\,,
	$$
	and therefore can be identified with a projective subvariety of
	$$
	\mathring{Y}^{U^{\perp}/U}_{n-1}=\{W\subset V|\, dim(W)=n,\, Q|_{W}\equiv0,\, U\subset W\}\,.
	$$
	Since $dim(U^{\perp}/U)=2(n-j)$ by applying formula~\ref{eq:dimYon} we get an equality
	$$
	dim\big(\mathring{Y}^{U^{\perp}/U}_{n-1}\big)= \dfrac{(n-j)^{2}-(n-j)}{2}\,.
	$$
	
	Thus, theorem of dimension of fibres gives us an estimate
	$$
	dim(Z_{j})\leqslant dim(\mathring{Y}^{P}_{j})+\dfrac{(n-j)^{2}-(n-j)}{2}\,.
	$$
	
	Finally, using formula~\ref{eq:dimYo} we get an estimate
	$$
	dim(Z_{j})\leqslant(n+1)j-j(j+1)-\dfrac{j(j-1)}{2}+\dfrac{(n-j)^{2}-(n-j)}{2}\,
	$$
	whose right hand side is equal to
	$$
	\dfrac{n^{2}-n}{2}-(j^{2}-j)=dim(\mathring{Y}^{V}_{n})-(j^{2}-j)\,.
	$$
	Therefore, if $j\geqslant2$ then there is a strict inequality $dim(Z_{j})<dim(\mathring{Y}^{V}_{n})$. In particular the subset
	$$
	Z_{1}=\mathring{Y}^{V}_{n}\backslash\big(Z_{2}\sqcup\dots\sqcup Z_{\large[\frac{n+1}{2}\large]}\big)
	$$
	is open and non-empty in $\mathring{Y}^{V}_{n}$. This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:nonclosed}
Let $k$ be an infinite field.
Let  $V$ be a $2n$-dimensional $k$-vector space equipped with a hyperbolic form $Q$.
Let $P\subset V$ be a $n+1$-dimensional subspace
%%%Suppose that there is some $n+1$-dimensional subspace
such that the restriction $Q|_{P}$ is non-degenerate. Then there exists a totally isotopic $n$-dimensional subspace $W\subset V$ such that $dim(P\cap W)=1$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
The variety $\mathring{Y}^{V}_{n}$ is $k$-rational. Its open subvariety  
$Z_{1}$ is non-empty since it is non-empty over the algebraic closure of $k$. 
Since the field $k$ is infinite the set of $k$-rational points of $Z_{1}$ is non-empty.
This proves the corollary.
\end{proof}

\section{Case of a free module over a local ring}\label{sec:mod}

During this section by $R$ and $k$ we will denote a regular local ring and its residue field accordingly. Recall that $char(k)\neq2$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:matinv}
	A matrix $A\in Mat_{n\times n}(R)$ has an inverse if and only if the quotient mathrix $\overline{A}\in Mat_{n\times n}(k)$ has an inverse.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	One implication is trivial. Suppose that $\overline{A}$ is invertible. It means that $det(\overline{A})$ is not equal to zero in $k$, which in turn means that  $det(A)$ does not belong to the maximal ideal of $R$. Thus $det(A)$ is invertible which means that $A$ has an inverse.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:freemod}
	Let $M$ be a free $R$-module of rank $n$. Let $\overline{u}_{1},\dots,\overline{u}_{r}$ be a set of lineary independent elements of $k$-linear vector space $\overline{M}$ and fix some arbitrary liftings $u_{i}\in M$ for each $\overline{u}_{i}$. Then the submodule $U:=\langle u_{1},\ldots,u_{r}\rangle_{R}$ of $M$ is a free direct summand of $M$ of rank $r$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Choose a basis of the type $\overline{u}_{1},\dots,\overline{u}_{r},\overline{v}_{1},\dots,\overline{v}_{n-r}$ in $\overline{M}$ and fix some liftings $v_{j}\in M$ for each $\overline{v}_{j}$. Then the elements $\{u_{i},v_{j}\}$ generate $M$ as an $R$-module according to Nakayama's lemma. Denote by $A$ the corresponding transformation matrix. Since $\{\overline{u}_{i},\overline{v}_{j}\}$ is a basis in $\overline{M}$, the quotient matrix $\overline{A}$ has an inverse. It follows from lemma~\ref{lem:matinv} that the matrix $A$ has an inverse as well. Thus $\{u_{i},v_{j}\}$ is also a basis in $M$. This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:freemod}
	Any direct summand $U$ of a free module $R^{n}$ is also free. Moreover if $\{u_{1},\dots,u_{r}\}$ is a basis in $U$ then $\{\overline{u}_{1},\dots,\overline{u}_{r}\}$ is a basis in $\overline{U}$ and vice versa.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Choose a projection $R^{n}\twoheadrightarrow U$. By definition it is surjective and its composition $U\hookrightarrow R^{n}\twoheadrightarrow U$ with the natural embedding $U\hookrightarrow R^{n}$
coincides with the identity automorphism $Id_{U}$. Reducing modulo maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}\subset R$ choose a basis $\{\overline{u}_{1},\dots,\overline{u}_{r}\}$ in the corresponding subspace $\overline{U}$ of $k^{n}$ and fix some lifting $\{u_{1},\dots,u_{r}\}$ that lies in the image of $U\hookrightarrow R^{n}$. Denote by $U^{'}$ the submodule $\langle u_{1},\dots,u_{r}\rangle_{R}$ in $R^{n}$  It follows from Nakayama's lemma, that the morphsim $U^{'}\longrightarrow U$ induced by the projection $R^{n}\twoheadrightarrow U$ is surjective, which in turn means that $U$ and $U^{'}$ actually coincide as $R$-submodules in $R^{n}$. It follows from lemma~\ref{lem:freemod} that $U^{'}$ is a free module with a basis $\{u_{1},\dots,u_{r}\}$.
	
	Likewise, if $U$ is a direct summand of $R^{n}$ and $\{u_{1},\dots,u_{r}\}$ is its basis then there exists a surjective $R$-linear morphism $R^{n}\twoheadrightarrow R^{r}$, that takes $u_{i}$ to the $i$-th element of the standard basis of $R^{r}$. Since the associated quotient morphism $k^{n}\twoheadrightarrow k^{r}$ of $k$-linear vector spaces stays surjective, $\{\overline{u}_{1},\dots,\overline{u}_{r}\}$ is obviously a basis in $\overline{U}$.
\end{proof}

Before introducing the main geometric result of this section we will prove a small technical lemma that will play a cruical part in the proof:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:orthogonal}
	Let $M$ be a free $R$-module with a fixed non-degenerate quadratic form $Q$. Denote by $O_{R}(M)$ the group of $R$-linear orthogonal automorphisms of $M$. Then the natural homomorphism $O_{R}(M)\rightarrow O_{k}(\overline{M})$ is surjective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	For our convenience we will also denote by $Q$ the corresponding bilinear form. Note that the group $O_{k}(\overline{M})$ is generated by reflections of the type
	$$
	r_{\overline{u}}:\overline{M}\rightarrow\overline{M}\,,\,\, \overline{v}\to\overline{v}-\dfrac{\overline{Q}(\overline{u},\overline{v})}{\overline{Q}(\overline{u},\overline{u})}\overline{u}
	$$
	where $\overline{u}$ goes over all elements of $\overline{M}$ such that $\overline{Q}(\overline{u},\overline{u})\neq0$. In particular this means that for any such $\overline{u}$ and for any of its liftings $u\mapsto\overline{u}$ in $M$ the corresponding element $Q(u,u)$ does not belong to the maximal ideal of $R$ and therefore is invertible. Thus there is a well defined reflection
	$$
	r_{u}:M\rightarrow M\,,\,\, v\to v-\dfrac{Q(u,v)}{Q(u,u)}u\,,
	$$
	
	that belongs to $O_{R}(M)$ and is obviously a lifting of the reflection $r_{\overline{u}}$. This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

Now let $M$ be a free $R$-module of rank $2n$, with a fixed hyperbolic form $Q$ on it. Suppose that $N\subset M$ is a free direct summand of $M$ such that $rk(N)=n+1$ and the restriction $Q|_{N}$ is non-degenerate. Then the corresponding $k$-linear vector spaces $\overline{M}$ and $\overline{N}$ satisfy the conditions of corollary~\ref{cor:nonclosed}. Indeed if $\{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n+1}\}$ is some basis of $N$ then it follows from corollary~\ref{cor:freemod} that $\{\overline{x}_{1},\ldots,\overline{x}_{n+1}\}$ is a basis of $\overline{N}\subset\overline{M}$. Since the restriction of the form $Q$  on $N$ is non-degenerate the corresponding morphism $Q|_{N}^{\vee}:N\to N^{\vee}$ of $R$-modules is an isomorphism. Therefore the restriction $\overline{Q}|_{\overline{N}}$ is non-degenerate according to lemma~\ref{lem:matinv}. Finally it is obvious that the form $\overline{Q}$ on $\overline{M}$ is also hyperbolic.
Thus, according to corollary~\ref{cor:nonclosed} there exists a totally isotopic $n$-dimensional subspace $\overline{W}\subset\overline{M}$ such that $dim(\overline{N}\cap\overline{W})=1$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:mod} Let $M$ be a free $R$-module of rank $2n$, with a fixed hyperbolic form $Q$ on it. Suppose that $N\subset M$ is a free direct summand of $M$ such that $rk(N)=n+1$ and the restriction $Q|_{N}$ is non-degenerate. Then there exists an $R$-submodule $W$ in $M$ such that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $W$ is a free direct summand of $M$ of rank $n$;
		\item the quotient morphism  $M\twoheadrightarrow\overline{M}$ surjectively maps $W$ to $\overline{W}$;
		\item $Q|_{W}\equiv0$.
	\end{itemize}
	Additionally, the submodule $W\cap N$ of $N$ will be a free direct summand of rank $1$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} Denote by $\mathbb{H}_{R}$ the hyperbolic plane with a standard basis $\{e,f\}$.
	Since $Q$ is hyperbolic there existis a decomposition $M=\mathbb{H}_{R}\oplus\ldots\oplus\mathbb{H}_{R}$. Denote by $\{e_{1},f_{1},\ldots,e_{n},f_{n}\}$ the corresponding basis in $M$. Then the $R$-submodule $\langle e_{1},\ldots,e_{n}\rangle_{R}\subset M$ is obviously a free totally isotopic summand of $M$ of rank $n$. Accordingly the set  $\{\overline{e}_{1},\overline{f}_{1},\ldots,\overline{e}_{n},\overline{f}_{n}\}$ is a basis of $k$-linear vector space $\overline{M}=\mathbb{H}_{k}\oplus\ldots\oplus\mathbb{H}_{k}$ and the subspace $\langle\overline{e}_{1},\ldots,\overline{e}_{n}\rangle_{k}\subset \overline{M}$ is totally isotopic and has dimension $n$. Choose some basis $\{\overline{w}_{1},\ldots,\overline{w}_{n}\}$ in $\overline{W}$. According to Witt's theorem there exists some $\overline{A}\in O_{k}(\overline{M})$, such that $\overline{A}(\overline{e_{i}})=\overline{w_{i}}$ for any $1\leqslant i\leqslant n$. It follows from lemma~\ref{lem:orthogonal} that $\overline{A}$ has some lifting $A\in O_{R}(M)$. Put $w_{i}:=Ae_{i}$ for $1\leqslant i\leqslant n$. Then the submodule $W:=\langle w_{1},\dots,w_{n}\rangle_{R}\subset M$ obviously satisfies the conditions of proposition~\ref{prop:mod}.
	
	Now denote by $\pi:N\rightarrow M/W$ the composition of the natural embedding $N\hookrightarrow M$ and the quotient homomorphism $M\twoheadrightarrow M/N$. Reducing modulo maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}\subset R$ we get the $k$-linear morphism $\overline{\pi}:\overline{N}\rightarrow\overline{M}/\overline{W}$. Its kernel coincides with the subspace $\overline{N}\cap\overline{W}\subset\overline{N}$. It immediately follows from the dimension theorem for vector spaces that $\overline{\pi}$ is surjective. It then follows from Nakayama's lemma that $\pi$ is surjective as well. According to lemma~\ref{lem:freemod} the $R$-module $M/W$ is free of rank $n$. Thus, $N\cap W$ is the kernel of the surjective $R$-linear morphism $\pi$ from the free $R$-module $N$ of rank $n+1$ to the free $R$-module $M/W$ of rank $n$. Therefore $N\cap W$ is a direct summand of $N$. The last statement of proposition~\ref{prop:mod} now follows form corollary~\ref{cor:freemod}.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{cor:unimod}
	Under the conditions of proposition~\ref{prop:mod} any generating element $w$ of free $R$-module $W\cap N$ of rank $1$ will be unimodular in $M$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	It follows from proposition~\ref{prop:mod} that $W\cap N$ is a direct summand of $M$. Therefore according to corollary~\ref{cor:freemod} the element $\overline{w}$ of $k$-linear vector space $\overline{M}$ is not equal to zero. Fix some basis of $M$ that contains $\overline{w}$ and then lift it to $M$ so that $\overline{w}$ is the lift of $w$. The corollary~\ref{cor:unimod} now directly follows from lemma~\ref{lem:freemod}.
\end{proof}

\section{Main result}\label{sec:main}

Here is the main result of this paper:

\begin{theorem}\label{prop:main}
		Let $R$ be a regular local ring of a mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ where $p$ is a prime number other than $2$. Suppose that the quotient ring $R/pR$ is also local and regular. Fix some non-degenerate Pfister form $Q(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^m})$ over the ring $R$ together with some invertible element $c$ in $R$. Then the equation $Q(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^m})=c$ has a solution over $R$ if and only if it has a solution over the fraction field $K$ of $R$.
\end{theorem}

The proof of proposition~\ref{prop:main} is heavily based on recent Cesnavicius Theorem \cite{C}.

We will also need the following technical lemma, that was originally proven in \cite{C-T}. Nevertheless, we still decided to give its detailed proof:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:tech}
	Let $R$ be a local ring with its residue field $k$ of characteristic other than $2$ and let $\alpha_{1},\dots,\alpha_{n}$ be invertible elements of $R$ with $n>2$.
	Then the equation
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:sol1}
		\alpha_{1}T_{1}^{2}+\dots+\alpha_{n}T_{n}^{2}=0
	\end{equation}
	has a unimodular solution in  $R^{n}$ if and only if the equation
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:sol2}
		\alpha_{1}T_{1}^{2}+\dots+\alpha_{n-1}T_{n-1}^{2}=-\alpha_{n}
	\end{equation}
	has a solution in $R^{n-1}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The first implication is trivial: $(v_{1},\dots,v_{n-1})$ being a solution of~\ref{eq:sol2} obviously implies $(v_{1},\dots,v_{n-1},1)$ being a unimodular solution of~\ref{eq:sol1}.
	
	Let  $v:=(v_{1},\dots,v_{n})$ be some unimodular solution of~\ref{eq:sol1}. Note that if element $v_{n}$ does not belong to the maximal ideal of $R$ i.e. is invertible, then
	$$
	\Big(\dfrac{v_{1}}{v_{n}},\dots,\dfrac{v_{n-1}}{v_{n}}\large\Big)
	$$
	is obviously a solution of~\ref{eq:sol2}.
	
	Suppose now that $v_{n}$ is not invertible. As earlier, denote the diagonal quadratic form, corresponding to~\ref{eq:sol1} by $Q$ as well as the associated bilinear form.  Note that for any $u:=(u_{1},\dots,u_{n})$ such that $Q(u,u)$ is invertible in $R$ the result of applying reflection $r_{u}$ to $v$ defines another solution
	$$
	r_{u}(v)= v-\dfrac{Q(u,v)}{Q(u,u)}u\,,
	$$
	of~\ref{eq:sol1}. Moreover, if we assume that $u_{n}$ and $Q(u,v)$ are both invertible in $R$, then $r_{u}(v)$ will also be a solution for~\ref{eq:sol2} since its $n$-th coordinate will also be invertible in $R$.
	Note that $u$ satisfies these assumptions if and only if the corresponding vector $\overline{u}:=(\overline{u}_{1},\ldots,\overline{u}_{n})\in k^n$ satisfies the following inequalities
	$$
	\overline{Q}(\overline{u},\overline{v})\neq0\,,\,\,
	\overline{Q}(\overline{u},\overline{u})\neq0\,,\,\,
	\overline{u}_{n}\neq0\,.
	$$
 Moreover, if there exists such a vector $\overline{u}$ in $k^{n}$ one can just lift it to $R^{n}$ to get a required $u$.
	
	 Since  $v$ is unimodular there exists at least one $i<n$ such that the corresponding coordinate $\overline{v}_{i}$ is not equal to zero. Let us fix such an $i$ together with some $j<n$, other than $i$. Assume that all the coordinates of $\overline{u}$ with indices other than $i$, $j$ and $n$ are equal to zero.
	Then the system of above inequalities will take the following form (for simplicity we will omit the overline symbol):
	$$
	\alpha_{i}v_{i}u_{i}+\alpha_{j}v_{j}u_{j}\neq0\,,\,\,
	\alpha_{i}u^{2}_{i}+\alpha_{j}u^{2}_{j}+\alpha_{n}u^{2}_{n}\neq0\,,\,\,
	u_{n}\neq0\,.
	$$
	Denote $\dfrac{u_{i}}{u_{n}}$ and $\dfrac{u_{j}}{u_{n}}$ by $x$ and $y$ accordingly. Then  the system above can be simplified up to the following form
	
	$$
	\alpha_{i}v_{i}x+\alpha_{j}v_{j}y\neq0\,,\,\,
	\alpha_{i}x^{2}+\alpha_{j}y^{2}\neq-\alpha_{n}\,.
	$$
	Note that if $\alpha_{i}\neq-\alpha_{n}$ then $x=1$ and $y=0$ obviously satisfy this system. On the contrary, if $\alpha_{i}=-\alpha_{n}$ then it is enough to put $x=1$ and find some non-zero $y$ that satisfies the inequality $\alpha_{j}v_{j}y\neq-\alpha_{i}v_{i}$. One can always find such an $y$ since the residue field $k$ containes more than two non-zero elements. This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

{\it We will now give the proof of theorem~\ref{prop:main}}. 
The first implication is trivial. Assume that the equation $Q(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^{m}})=c$ has a solution over $K$. 
Then the equation $Q(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^{m}})-cT_{2^{m}+1}=0$ also has some non-trivial solution $(a_{1},\ldots,a_{2^{m}+1})$ over $K$. 
According to lemma~\ref{lem:tech} the proof of the second implication can be reduced to finding some unimodular solution of the equation 
$Q(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^{m}})-cT_{2^{m}+1}=0$ over $R$. Denote by $\widetilde{Q}(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^{m+1}})$ the tensor product of $Q$ and 
the Pfister form $\langle1,-c\rangle$. Then the vector $(a_{1},\ldots,a_{2^{m}+1},0,\ldots,0)$ is a solution of the equation 
$\widetilde{Q}(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^{m+1}})=0$ over $K$. Since $\widetilde{Q}$ is a Pfister form this means 
that it is hyperbolic over $K$. According to 
Cesnavicius \cite[Corollary 9.6]{C} the form $\widetilde{Q}$ is also hyperbolic over $R$. 
Put $M=R^{2^{m+1}}$ and take a free $R$-submodule $N\subset M$ generated by the first $2^{m}+1$ basis elements of $M$. 
Then the pair $(M,N)$ satisfies the conditions of proposition  ~\ref{prop:mod}. 
In particular, the unimodular isotopic element $w$ from corollary~\ref{cor:unimod} provides a unimodular solution for the equation 
$Q(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^{m}})-cT_{2^{m}+1}=0$ over $R$. 
{\it This concludes the proof of theorem~\ref{prop:main}.
}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:main}
	Let $Q(T_{1},\ldots,T_{2^{m}})$ be the Pfister form from theorem~\ref{prop:main}. 
Then the set $S_{Q}$ of all the invertible elements $c\in R^{*}$ that are represented by the form $Q$ is a multiplicative subgroup in $R^{*}$.
	\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose that the elements $c_{1,2}\in R^{*}$ are represented by $Q$, that is the equations $Q=c_{1}$ and $Q=c_{2}$ have some solutions over $R$. Since Pfister forms are mutliplicative over fields this means that the equation $Q=c_{1}c_{2}$ has some solution over $K$. According to theorem~\ref{prop:main} it also has a solution over $R$. Thus $c_{1}c_{2}$ is represented by $Q$ and therefore $S_{Q}$ is closed under multiplication. If there is a solution $v$ for the equation $Q=c$ then $Q(c^{-1}v)=c^{-2}Q(v)=c^{-1}$. Therefore $S_{Q}$ is closed under taking an inverse. Finally since $Q$ is a Phister form the equation $Q=1$ always has a solution. This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

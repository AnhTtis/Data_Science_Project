    "abstract": "We study flow of renormalization group (RG) transformations for the massless\nGross-Neveu model in a non-perturbative formulation. The model is defined on a\nd=2 dimensional Euclidean space with a finite volume. The quadratic\napproximation to the flow stays bounded after suitable renormalization. We show\nthat for weak coupling this property also is true for the complete flow As an\napplication we prove an ultraviolet stability bound for the model. Our\ntreatment is an application of a method of Bauerschmidt, Brydges, and Slade.\nThe method was developed for an infrared problem, and is now applied to an\nultraviolet problem.",

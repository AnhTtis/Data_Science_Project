    "abstract": "We study the extension groups between (modular) Wakimoto sheaves in type $\\tilde{A_1}$. Firstly we determine them completely over characteristic zero fields. Secondly we describe a dg model which allows us to compute these groups in the antispherical category for arbitrary coefficients.",

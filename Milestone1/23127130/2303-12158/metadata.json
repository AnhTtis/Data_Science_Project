    "abstract": "Viscous linear surface waves are studied at arbitrary wavelength, layer thickness, viscosity and surface tension. We find that in shallow enough fluids no surface waves can propagate. This layer thickness is determined for some fluids, water, glycerin and mercury. Even in any thicker fluid layers, propagation of very short and very long waves is forbidden. When wave propagation is possible, only a single propagating mode exists for a given horizontal wave number. In contrast, there are two types of non-propagating modes. One kind of them exists at all wavelength and material parameters, and there are infinitely many such modes for a given wave number, distinguished by their decay rates. The other kind of non-propagating mode that is less attenuated may appear in zero, one or two specimens. We notice the presence of two length scales as material parameters, one related to viscosity and the other to surface tension. We consider possible modes for a given material on the parameter plane layer thickness versus wave number and discuss bifurcations among different mode types. Motion of surface particles and time evolution of surface elevation is also studied at various parameters in glycerin, and a great variety of behaviour is found, including counterclockwise surface particle motion and negative group velocity in wave propagation.",

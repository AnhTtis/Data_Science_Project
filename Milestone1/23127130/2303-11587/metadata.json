    "abstract": "This article aims to study fractal interpolation functions corresponding to a sequence of iterated function systems (IFSs). For a suitable choice of a sequence of IFS parameters, the corresponding non-stationary fractal function is a better approximant for the non-smooth approximant. In this regard, we first construct the non-stationary interpolant in the Lipschitz space and study some topological properties of the associated non-linear fractal operator. Next, we discuss the stability of the interpolant having small perturbations. Also, we investigate the sensitivity with respect to the perturbations of the IFS parameters by providing an upper bound of errors acquired in the approximation process. In the end, we study the continuous dependence of the proposed interpolant on different IFS parameters.",

    "abstract": "A compelling unified model of dark energy and early dark energy (EDE) is presented, using a scalar field with an exponential runaway potential, in the context of alpha-attractors. The field is originally trapped at an enhanced symmetry point, subsequently thaws to become successful EDE and eventually slow-rolls to become dark energy. EDE ameliorates the observed Hubble tension.",

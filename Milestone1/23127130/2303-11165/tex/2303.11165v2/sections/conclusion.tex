 Existing CL algorithms, such as sampling strategies, distillation, and FC layer corrections, fail in a budgeted computational setup. Simple Naive methods based on experience replay outperform all the considered CL methods. This conclusion was persistent even under various computational budgets and an increased number of time steps. We find that most CL approaches perform worse when a lower computational budget is allowed per time step.

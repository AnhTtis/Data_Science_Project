    "abstract": "Sparse regression codes (SPARC) connect the sparse signal recovery framework of compressive sensing with error control coding techniques. SPARC encoding produces codewords which are \\emph{sparse} linear combinations of columns of a dictionary matrix. SPARC decoding is accomplished using sparse signal recovery algorithms. We construct dictionary matrices using Gold codes and mutually unbiased bases and develop suitable generalizations of SPARC (GSPARC). We develop a greedy decoder, referred as match and decode (MAD) algorithm and provide its analytical noiseless recovery guarantees. We propose a parallel greedy search technique, referred as parallel MAD (PMAD), to improve the performance. We describe the applicability of GSPARC with PMAD decoder for multi-user channels, providing a non-orthogonal multiple access scheme. We present numerical results comparing the block error rate (BLER) performance of the proposed algorithms for GSPARC in AWGN channels, in the short block length regime. The PMAD decoder gives better BLER than the approximate message passing decoder for SPARC. GSPARC with PMAD gives comparable and competitive BLER performance, when compared to other existing codes. In multi-user channels, GSPARC with PMAD decoder outperforms the sphere packing lower bounds of an orthogonal multiple access scheme, which has the same spectral efficiency.",

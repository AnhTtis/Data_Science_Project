    "abstract": "Re-randomization has gained popularity as a tool for experiment-based causal\ninference due to its superior covariate balance and statistical efficiency\ncompared to classic randomized experiments. However, the basic re-randomization\nmethod, known as ReM, and many of its extensions have been deemed sub-optimal\nas they fail to prioritize covariates that are more strongly associated with\npotential outcomes. To address this limitation and design more efficient\nre-randomization procedures, a more precise quantification of covariate\nheterogeneity and its impact on the causal effect estimator is in a great\nappeal. This work fills in this gap with a Bayesian criterion for\nre-randomization and a series of novel re-randomization procedures derived\nunder such a criterion. Both theoretical analyses and numerical studies show\nthat the proposed re-randomization procedures under the Bayesian criterion\noutperform existing ReM-based procedures significantly in effectively balancing\ncovariates and precisely estimating the unknown causal effect.",

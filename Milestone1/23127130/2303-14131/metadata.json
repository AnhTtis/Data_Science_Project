    "abstract": "Reaction network of fluorine-18, oxygen-15 and nitrogen-15 is considered for its temperature dependent energy output. The main reactions for generation and annihilation of oxygen and fluorine are coupled in the reaction equations while nitrogen is produced as a decay product. We find that the governing set of equations for F18(p, alpha)O15 process in the phase diagram exhibit a predominance of the direct reaction rather than the reverse reaction consuming O15. The time-scale determined by the exact solution of this system yields relatively short time-scale conversion of fluorine into oxygen indicating an energy generation of 2.8MeV per reaction. The temperature dependence shows that the effective reaction occurs at temperature about 0.04GK or above.",

    "abstract": "Approximating convex bodies is a fundamental question in geometry and has a wide variety of applications. Consider a convex body $K$ of diameter $Δ$ in $\\textbf{R}^d$ for fixed $d$. The objective is to minimize the number of vertices (alternatively, the number of facets) of an approximating polytope for a given Hausdorff error $\\varepsilon$. It is known from classical results of Dudley (1974) and Bronshteyn and Ivanov (1976) that $Θ((Δ/\\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$ vertices (alternatively, facets) are both necessary and sufficient. While this bound is tight in the worst case, that of Euclidean balls, it is far from optimal for skinny convex bodies.\n  A natural way to characterize a convex object's skinniness is in terms of its relationship to the Euclidean ball. Given a convex body $K$, define its \\emph{volume diameter} $Δ_d$ to be the diameter of a Euclidean ball of the same volume as $K$, and define its \\emph{surface diameter} $Δ_{d-1}$ analogously for surface area. It follows from generalizations of the isoperimetric inequality that $Δ\\geq Δ_{d-1} \\geq Δ_d$.\n  Arya, da Fonseca, and Mount (SoCG 2012) demonstrated that the diameter-based bound could be made surface-area sensitive, improving the above bound to $O((Δ_{d-1}/\\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$. In this paper, we strengthen this by proving the existence of an approximation with $O((Δ_d/\\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$ facets.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction by Hodges, and refinement by Väänänen, team semantic constructions have been used to generate expressively enriched logics still conserving nice properties, such as compactness or decidability. In contrast, these logics fail to be substitutional, limiting any algebraic treatment, and rendering schematic uniform proof systems impossible. This shortcoming can be attributed to the flatness principle, commonly adhered to when generating team semantics. Investigating the formation of team semantics from algebraic semantics, and disregarding the flatness principle, we present the logic of teams, LT, a substitutional logic for which important propositional team logics are axiomatisable as fragments. Starting from classical propositional logic and Boolean algebras, we give semantics for LT by considering the algebras that are powersets of Boolean algebras B, equipped with internal (point-wise) and external (set-theoretic) connectives. Furthermore, we present a well-motivated complete and sound labelled natural deduction system for LT.",

    "abstract": "The Newtonian dynamics of particles in brane gravity is investigated. Due to the coupling of the particles' energy-momentum tensor to the tension of the brane, the particle is semi-confined and oscillates along the extra dimension. We demonstrate that the frequency of these oscillations is proportional to the kinetic energy of the particle in the brane. We show that the classical stability of particle trajectories on the brane gives us the Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization condition. The particle's motion along the extra dimension allows us to formulate a geometrical version of the uncertainty principle. Furthermore, we exhibited that the particle's motion along the extra dimension is identical to the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The dynamics of a free particle, particles in a box, a harmonic oscillator, a bouncing particle, and tunneling are re-examined. We show that the particle's motion along the extra dimension yields a quantized energy spectrum for bound states.",

    "abstract": "Modern demands of the statistics profession call for reimagining statistics training. The discipline needs to attract and develop students who are effective as real-world problem solvers, interdisciplinary collaborators, communicators, leaders, and teachers. Demand for statistics professionals with broad technical and non-technical skills has grown in a variety of settings, but especially in business and industry. Academic curricula, though, remain primarily oriented around a narrow, technical conception of statistics. Advanced graduate-level training essentially is limited to research doctorate (PhD) programs which tend to prioritize theoretical and methodological research over development of effective applied statisticians. Other professions, such as those of physicians and surgeons, have training oriented around a professional doctorate, as opposed to a research doctorate. The statistics profession should consider not only changes to PhD curricula, but also the potential for a professional doctorate, drawing ideas from the curricula of other professional degrees such as the MD.",

    "abstract": "With the development of computer -systems that can collect and analyze enormous volumes of data, the medical profession is establishing several non-invasive tools. This work attempts to develop a non-invasive technique for identifying respiratory sounds acquired by a stethoscope and voice recording software via machine learning techniques. This study suggests a trained and proven CNN-based approach for categorizing respiratory sounds. A visual representation of each audio sample is constructed, allowing resource identification for classification using methods like those used to effectively describe visuals. We used a technique called Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). Here, features are retrieved and categorized via VGG16 (transfer learning) and prediction is accomplished using 5-fold cross-validation. Employing various data splitting techniques, Respiratory Sound Database obtained cutting-edge results, including accuracy of 95%, precision of 88%, recall score of 86%, and F1 score of 81%. The ICBHI dataset is used to train and test the model.",

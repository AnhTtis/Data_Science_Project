    "abstract": "For a set $Q$ of points in the plane and a real number $δ\\ge 0$, let $\\mathbb{G}_δ(Q)$ be the graph defined on $Q$ by connecting each pair of points at distance at most $δ$.\n  We consider the connectivity of $\\mathbb{G}_δ(Q)$ in the best scenario when the location of a few of the points is uncertain, but we know for each uncertain point a line segment that contains it. More precisely, we consider the following optimization problem: given a set $P$ of $n-k$ points in the plane and a set $S$ of $k$ line segments in the plane, find the minimum $δ\\ge 0$ with the property that we can select one point $p_s\\in s$ for each segment $s\\in S$ and the corresponding graph $\\mathbb{G}_δ( P\\cup \\{ p_s\\mid s\\in S\\})$ is connected. It is known that the problem is NP-hard. We provide an algorithm to compute exactly an optimal solution in $O(f(k) n \\log n)$ time, for a computable function $f(\\cdot)$. This implies that the problem is FPT when parameterized by $k$. The best previous algorithm is using $O((k!)^k k^{k+1}\\cdot n^{2k})$ time and computes the solution up to fixed precision.",

    "abstract": "We study two models of random multiplicative functions: Rademacher random multiplicative functions supported on the squarefree integers $f$, and Rademacher random completely multiplicative functions $f^*$. We prove that the partial sums $\\sum_{n\\leq x}f^*(n)$ and $\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\frac{f(n)}{\\sqrt{n}}$ change sign infinitely often as $x\\to\\infty$, almost surely. The case $\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\frac{f^*(n)}{\\sqrt{n}}$ is left as an open question and we stress the possibility of only a finite number of sign changes, with positive probability.",

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have proposed VATr, a few-shot styled HTG approach that is able to reproduce unseen calligraphic styles and generate characters rarely encountered in the training set. These capabilities are achieved by exploiting supervised pre-training on a large synthetic dataset of calligraphic fonts and by representing the textual content as a sequence of visual archetypes, \ie~binary images of Unifont-rendered characters. Experimental results demonstrate that by pre-training, we are able to extract more representative style features that disregard the background and the ink texture. Moreover, by using the visual archetypes, we are able to exploit shape similarities among characters, which eases the generation of the rare ones.

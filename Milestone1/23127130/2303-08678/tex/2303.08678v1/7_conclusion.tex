\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose a novel framework named pFedPT, a personalized federated learning method based on visual prompts. We make the first attempt to introduce visual prompts to personalized federated learning, using a prompt generator to distill information from local data into the visual prompts and fine-tune the backbone. In the process of pFedPT training, the backbone could use the guidance information from visual prompts to perform the personalized downstream tasks. Since the prompt generator is trained locally on the client, it does not reveal data distribution information about the client to others or the server. pFedPF can also serve a strong plugin to boost the performance of existing FL methods, which could be of independent interest. We provide extensive experiments to illustrate how the pFedPT works and demonstrate its effectiveness in experiments with heterogeneous settings and several types of dataset partition.

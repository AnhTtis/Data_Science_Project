%%%%%%%%% APENDIX
This appendix is organized as follows: In Sec.~\ref{sec:app_expt_setup} we provide details about the datasets and the splits. In Sec.~\ref{sec:app-impl-det} we elaborate the implementation details of our baselines and the adapted methods under the \cincdtitle (\cincd) setting. In Sec.~\ref{sec:app-disc-uil}, we additionally discuss the fundamental difference between \cincd and \uillong (\uil), and also report the comparison with a SOTA \uil method. Sec.~\ref{sec:app-disc-overlap} extends the discussion on the decision to start multi-step class-incremental novel class discovery from self-supervised pre-trained models. We report the additional experimental results in more detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:app-exp-results}.

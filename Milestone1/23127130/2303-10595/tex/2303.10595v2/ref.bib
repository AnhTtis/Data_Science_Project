@Comment abstract = {The resonating-group method is used to make a systematic study of the α + α. N + α. N +16O and N + 40Ca scattering problems. The nucleon-nucleon potential employed contains a weakly repulsive core and yields a satisfactory description of not only the two-nucleon low-energy scattering data but also the essential properties of the deuteron. triton and α-particle. The result shows that the calculated values do generally agree quite well with experimental data. In particular, it is found that, because of the use of totally antisymmetric wave functions, the scattering behavior at large angles is adequately described.}

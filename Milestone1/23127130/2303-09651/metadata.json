    "abstract": "A concise overview of the vibrational model of heat transfer in simple fluids with soft pairwise interactions is presented. The model is applied to evaluate the thermal conductivity coefficient of the strongly coupled Yukawa fluid, which often serves as a simplest model of a real liquid-like dusty (complex) plasma. A reasonable agreement with the available data from molecular dynamics numerical simulations is observed. Universality of the properly reduced thermal conductivity coefficient with respect to the effective coupling parameter is examined. Relations between the vibrational model and the excess entropy scaling of the thermal conductivity coefficient are discussed.",

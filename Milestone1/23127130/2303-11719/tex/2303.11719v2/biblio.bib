abstract = {We present two algorithms for finding the edge connectivity of a given directed graph G. The first algorithm runs in O(nm) time, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in G. The second algorithm runs in O(λ2n2) time, where λ is the edge connectivity of G. Combining both algorithms yields an O(MIN{m, λ2n}n) time algorithm for finding the edge connectivity of directed graphs. We also present an O(MIN{m, k2n}n) time algorithm for deciding whether the edge connectivity of a given directed graph G is at least k. Both algorithms are superior to the best known algorithms for finding the edge connectivity of directed graphs.}

abstract = {Abstract A digraph is k ${\bf{k}}$-strong if it has n ≥ k + 1 $n\ge k+1$ vertices and every induced subdigraph on at least n − k + 1 $n-k+1$ vertices is strongly connected. A tournament is a digraph with no pair of nonadjacent vertices. We prove that every tournament on n ≥ k + 1 $n\ge k+1$ vertices can be made k $k$-strong by adding no more than k + 1 2 $\left(\genfrac{}{}{0ex}{}{k+1}{2}\right)$ arcs. This solves a conjecture from 1994. A digraph is semicomplete if there is at least one arc between any pair of distinct vertices x , y $x,y$. Since every semicomplete digraph contains a spanning tournament, the result above also holds for semicomplete digraphs. Our result also implies that for every k ≥ 2 $k\ge 2$, every semicomplete digraph on at least 3 k − 1 $3k-1$ vertices can be made k $k$-strong by reversing no more than k + 1 2 $\left(\genfrac{}{}{0ex}{}{k+1}{2}\right)$ arcs.}

abstract = {In this classic book, first published in 1962, L. R. Ford, Jr., and D. R. Fulkerson set the foundation for the study of network flow problems. The models and algorithms introduced in Flows in Networks are used widely today in the fields of transportation systems, manufacturing, inventory planning, image processing, and Internet traffic. The techniques presented by Ford and Fulkerson spurred the development of powerful computational tools for solving and analyzing network flow models, and also furthered the understanding of linear programming. In addition, the book helped illuminate and unify results in combinatorial mathematics while emphasizing proofs based on computationally efficient construction. Flows in Networks is rich with insights that remain relevant to current research in engineering, management, and other sciences. This landmark work belongs on the bookshelf of every researcher working with networks.}

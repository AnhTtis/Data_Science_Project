  abstract  = {Quantum networks provide opportunities and challenges across a range of intellectual and technical frontiers, including quantum computation, communication and metrology. The realization of quantum networks composed of many nodes and channels requires new scientific capabilities for generating and characterizing quantum coherence and entanglement. Fundamental to this endeavour are quantum interconnects, which convert quantum states from one physical system to those of another in a reversible manner. Such quantum connectivity in networks can be achieved by the optical interactions of single photons and atoms, allowing the distribution of entanglement across the network and the teleportation of quantum states between nodes.},

  abstract  = {Quantum computers promise to perform certain tasks that are believed to be intractable to classical computers. Boson sampling is such a task and is considered a strong candidate to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. We performed Gaussian boson sampling by sending 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer with full connectivity and random matrix—the whole optical setup is phase-locked—and sampling the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. The obtained samples were validated against plausible hypotheses exploiting thermal states, distinguishable photons, and uniform distribution. The photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, generates up to 76 output photon clicks, which yields an output state-space dimension of 1030 and a sampling rate that is faster than using the state-of-the-art simulation strategy and supercomputers by a factor of {\textasciitilde}1014.},

Squeezed states in a broad Fourier frequency band down to 1 Hz have been observed for the first time. Nonclassical properties of light in such a low frequency band are required for high efficiency quantum information storage in electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) media. The states observed also cover the frequency band of ultra-high precision laser interferometers for gravitational wave detection and can be used to reach the regime of quantum non-demolition interferometry. Furthermore, they cover the frequencies of motion of heavy macroscopic objects and might therefore support attempts to observe entanglement in our macroscopic world.},

Multiphoton processes occur and are important for many aspects of matter–radiation interactions that include the efficient ionization of atoms and molecules, and, more generally, atomic transition mechanisms; system-environment couplings and dissipative quantum dynamics; laser physics, optical parametric processes, and interferometry. A single review cannot account for all aspects of such an enormously vast subject. Here we choose to concentrate our attention on parametric processes in nonlinear media, with special emphasis on the engineering of nonclassical states of photons and atoms that are relevant for the conceptual investigations as well as for the practical applications of forefront aspects of modern quantum mechanics. We present a detailed analysis of the methods and techniques for the production of genuinely quantum multiphoton processes in nonlinear media, and the corresponding models of multiphoton effective interactions. We review existing proposals for the classification, engineering, and manipulation of nonclassical states, including Fock states, macroscopic superposition states, and multiphoton generalized coherent states. We introduce and discuss the structure of canonical multiphoton quantum optics and the associated one- and two-mode canonical multiphoton squeezed states. This framework provides a consistent multiphoton generalization of two-photon quantum optics and a consistent Hamiltonian description of multiphoton processes associated to higher-order nonlinearities. Finally, we discuss very recent advances that by combining linear and nonlinear optical devices allow to realize multiphoton entangled states of the electromagnetic field, either in discrete or in continuous variables, that are relevant for applications to efficient quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and related problems in quantum communication and information.}

A cavity with a large Purcell factor is required to collect the emission efficiently, but a small Purcell factor is required for long-time memory storage. Here, we introduce an effective and versatile one-dimensional atom consisting of two interacting quantum emitters efficiently coupled to a cavity mode with a large Purcell factor. The dipole--dipole interaction gives rise to a subradiant state with a tunable bandwidth. We demonstrate generation of time-shaped single photons and implementation of quantum memory. We discuss experimental challenges and practical implementation using different systems.},

We therefore show that quantum memories can be a powerful component for scalable photonic quantum information processing architectures.},

It is shown that the converging-beam illumination setup (CB-FT) is much simpler and works better than the classical parallel beam illumination setup within a restricted range of object size and lens aperture. This range corresponds to many practical cases. Therefore, the CB-FT should be preferred in ordinary cases whereas the classical setup with a special purpose Fourier lens should be used only for a large space--bandwidth product. It is probably never a good solution to use the parallel beam configuration with a general purpose lens as the Fourier lens.},

The introduction of Abbe's sine condition into the chief ray path allows the paraxial restriction to be dropped, and the Fourier transform relationship becomes valid for large as well as small field angles. The resulting Fourier transform lens designs are remarkably different from conventional imaging systems.},

Contrary to many well-known solutions it does not require nonlinear effects and is therefore suitable for single-photon-level measurements. Our method is based on introducing a series of controlled time and frequency shifts, where the latter is performed via an electro-optic modulator allowing a fully-electronic experimental control. We characterized the full spectral and temporal width of a classical and single-photon-level pulse and successfully tested the applicability of the reconstruction algorithm of the spectral phase and amplitude.

For qutrits, we implement a 3×3 extension of the Hadamard gate: the balanced tritter. This tritter—the first ever demonstrated for frequency modes—attains fidelity 0.9989±0.0004.

However, the current approaches require photons indistinguishable in frequency---a major challenge for systems experiencing different local environments or of different physical compositions altogether. Here, we develop an entirely new platform that actually exploits such frequency mismatch for processing quantum information. Labeled ``spectral linear optical quantum computation'' (spectral LOQC), our protocol offers favorable linear scaling of optical resources and enjoys an unprecedented degree of parallelism, as an arbitrary N-qubit quantum gate may be performed in parallel on multiple N-qubit sets in the same linear optical device. Not only does spectral LOQC offer new potential for optical interconnects, but it also brings the ubiquitous technology of high-speed fiber optics to bear on photonic quantum information, making wavelength-configurable and robust optical quantum systems within reach.},

In particular, the ability to capture a train of optical pulses, interfere them in an arbitrary way and finally, perform on-demand release could realize arbitrary optical computation. Here we demonstrate the operation of a coherent optical memory being able to store optical pulses in the form of collective spin-wave excitations in a two-dimensional wavevector space. During storage, we perform complex beamsplitter operations and demonstrate a variety of protocols implemented at the processing stage, including real-time controlled interference of a pair of spin-wave modes with 95\% visibility.

One of the recently explored strategies to fully exploit information already present in the field is to perform a quantum-inspired tailored measurements. Here we exploit the full spectral information of the optical field in order to beat the Rayleigh limit in spectroscopy. We employ an optical quantum memory with spin-wave storage and an embedded processing capability to implement a time-inversion interferometer for input light, projecting the optical field in the symmetric-antisymmetric mode basis. Our tailored measurement achieves a resolution of 15 kHz and requires 20 times less photons than a corresponding Rayleigh-limited conventional method. We demonstrate the advantage of our technique over both conventional spectroscopy and heterodyne measurements, showing potential for application in distinguishing ultra-narrowband emitters, optical communication channels, or signals transduced from lower-frequency domains.},

For space-varying degradations and nonstationary processes, however, the optimal linear estimate requires O(N2) time for implementation. Optimal filtering in fractional Fourier domains permits reduction of the error compared with ordinary Fourier domain Wiener filtering for certain types of degradation and noise while requiring only O(N log N) implementation time. The amount of reduction in error depends on the signal and noise statistics as well as on the degradation model. The largest improvements are typically obtained for chirplike degradations and noise, but other types of degradation and noise may also benefit substantially from the method (e.g., nonconstant velocity motion blur and degradation by inhomegeneous atmospheric turbulence). In any event, these reductions are achieved at no additional cost.},

abstract = {Time-frequency (TF) filtering of analog signals has played a crucial role in the development of radio-frequency communications and is currently being recognized as an essential capability for communications, both classical and quantum, in the optical frequency domain. How best to design optical time-frequency (TF) filters to pass a targeted temporal mode (TM), and to reject background (noise) photons in the TF detection window? The solution for `coherent' TF filtering is known---the quantum pulse gate---whereas the conventional, more common method is implemented by a sequence of incoherent spectral filtering and temporal gating operations. To compare these two methods, we derive a general formalism for two-stage incoherent time-frequency filtering, finding expressions for signal pulse transmission efficiency, and for the ability to discriminate TMs, which allows the blocking of unwanted background light. We derive the tradeoff between efficiency and TM discrimination ability, and find a remarkably concise relation between these two quantities and the time-bandwidth product of the combined filters. We apply the formalism to two examples---rectangular filters or Gaussian filters---both of which have known orthogonal-function decompositions. The formalism can be applied to any state of light occupying the input temporal mode, e.g., `classical' coherent-state signals or pulsed single-photon states of light. In contrast to the radio-frequency domain, where coherent detection is standard and one can use coherent matched filtering to reject noise, in the optical domain direct detection is optimal in a number of scenarios where the signal flux is extremely small. Our analysis shows how the insertion loss and SNR change when one uses incoherent optical filters to reject background noise, followed by direct detection, e.g. photon counting. We point out implications in classical and quantum optical communications. As an example, we study quantum key distribution, wherein strong rejection of background noise is necessary to maintain a high quality of entanglement, while high signal transmission is needed to ensure a useful key generation rate.},

Earlier workers have shown how to construct a device for sorting a photon according to its azimuthal LG mode index, which describes the orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by the field. In this paper we propose and demonstrate a mode sorter based on the fractional Fourier transform to efficiently decompose the optical field according to its radial profile. We experimentally characterize the performance of our implementation by separating individual radial modes as well as superposition states. The reported scheme can, in principle, achieve unit efficiency and thus can be suitable for applications that involve quantum states of light. This approach can be readily combined with existing OAM mode sorters to provide a complete characterization of the transverse profile of the optical field.},

Specifically, the paper is geared toward signal processing practitioners by emphasizing the practical digital realizations and applications of the FRFT. It discusses three major topics. First, the manuscripts relates the FRFT to other mathematical transforms. Second, it discusses various approaches for practical realizations of the FRFT. Third, we overview the practical applications of the FRFT. From these discussions, we can clearly state that the FRFT is closely related to other mathematical transforms, such as time–frequency and linear canonical transforms. Nevertheless, we still feel that major contributions are expected in the field of the digital realizations and its applications, especially, since many digital realizations of the FRFT still lack properties of the continuous FRFT. Overall, the FRFT is a valuable signal processing tool. Its practical applications are expected to grow significantly in years to come, given that the FRFT offers many advantages over the traditional Fourier analysis.},

Quantum information theory can tackle them both in one holistic formalism: model the light as a quantum object, consider any quantum measurement, and pick the one that gives the best statistics. While Helstrom pioneered the theory half a century ago and first applied it to incoherent imaging, it was not until recently that the approach offered a genuine surprise on the age-old topic by predicting a new class of superior imaging methods. For the resolution of two sub-Rayleigh sources, the new methods have been shown theoretically and experimentally to outperform direct imaging and approach the true quantum limits. Recent efforts to generalise the theory for an arbitrary number of sources suggest that, despite the existence of harsh quantum limits, the quantum-inspired methods can still offer significant improvements over direct imaging for subdiffraction objects, potentially benefiting many applications in astronomy as well as fluorescence microscopy.},

In the context of statistical image processing, violation of the criterion is especially detrimental to the estimation of the separation between the sources, and modern far-field superresolution techniques rely on suppressing the emission of close sources to enhance the localization precision. Using quantum optics, quantum metrology, and statistical analysis, here we show that, even if two close incoherent sources emit simultaneously, measurements with linear optics and photon counting can estimate their separation from the far field almost as precisely as conventional methods do for isolated sources, rendering Rayleigh’s criterion irrelevant to the problem. Our results demonstrate that superresolution can be achieved not only for fluorophores but also for stars.},

However, to date, implementations of optical mode sorters only operate on specific sets of modes, such as those carrying orbital angular momentum, and therefore lack versatility with respect to operation with an arbitrary spatial basis. Here we demonstrate an arbitrary spatial mode sorter by harnessing the random mode mixing process occurring during light propagation in a multimode fiber by wave-front shaping. By measuring the transmission matrix of the fiber, we show sorting of up to 25 transverse spatial modes of the Fourier, Laguerre-Gaussian, and random basis to an arbitrary set of positions at the output. Our approach provides a spatial mode sorter that is compact, easy to fabricate, programable, and usable with any spatial basis, which is promising for quantum and classical information science.},

  abstract  = {Interferometry is one of the central organizing principles of optics. Key to interferometry is the concept of optical delay, which facilitates spectral analysis in terms of time-harmonics. In contrast, when analyzing a beam in a Hilbert space spanned by spatial modes – a critical task for spatial-mode multiplexing and quantum communication – basis-specific principles are invoked that are altogether distinct from that of ‘delay’. Here, we extend the traditional concept of temporal delay to the spatial domain, thereby enabling the analysis of a beam in an arbitrary spatial-mode basis – exemplified using Hermite-Gaussian and radial Laguerre-Gaussian modes. Such generalized delays correspond to optical implementations of fractional transforms; for example, the fractional Hankel transform is the generalized delay associated with the space of Laguerre-Gaussian modes, and an interferometer incorporating such a ‘delay’ obtains modal weights in the associated Hilbert space. By implementing an inherently stable, reconfigurable spatial-light-modulator-based polarization-interferometer, we have constructed a ‘Hilbert-space analyzer’ capable of projecting optical beams onto any modal basis.},

In our scheme, the behaviors of the a-CS in position space show many similarities to the quantum version of the optical cat state in phase space, for example, movement, rotation, and interference. Experimentally, the a-CS, which has two spatially localized Gaussian intensity lobes, can be evolved from “kitten” to “cat” by engineering the acquired phase hologram. Additionally, we simulated the “decoherence” of the a-CS influenced by atmospheric turbulence. The a-CS provides a reliable tool for visualizing and studying the behaviors of quantum cat states in phase space.},

As a natural extension, several “cats” (quasi-classical objects) can be prepared into coherent quantum superposition states, which is known as multipartite cat states demonstrating quantum entanglement among macroscopically distinct objects. Here, we present a highly scalable approach to deterministically create flying multipartite Schrödinger’s cat states by reflecting coherent-state photons from a microwave cavity containing a superconducting qubit. We perform full quantum state tomography on the cat states with up to four photonic modes and confirm the existence of quantum entanglement among them. We also witness the hybrid entanglement between discrete-variable states (the qubit) and continuous-variable states (the flying multipartite cat) through a joint quantum state tomography. Our work provides an enabling step for implementing a series of quantum metrology and quantum information processing protocols based on cat states. This study provides a scalable approach to prepare propagating photons in multipartite entangled coherent states.},

The integral representation of this transform can be used to construct a table of fractional order Fourier transforms. A generalized operational calculus is developed, paralleling the familiar one for the ordinary transform. Its application provides a convenient technique for solving certain classes of ordinary and partial differential equations which arise in quantum mechanics from classical quadratic hamiltonians. The method of solution is first illustrated by its application to the free and to the forced quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator. The corresponding Green's functions are obtained in closed form. The new technique is then extended to three-dimensional problems and applied to the quantum mechanical description of the motion of electrons in a constant magnetic field. The stationary states, energy levels and the evolution of an initial wave packet are obtained by a systematic application of the rules of the generalized operational calculus.Finally, the method is applied to the second order partial differential equation with time-dependent coefficients describing the quantum mechanical dynamics of electrons in a time-varying magnetic field.},

abstract = {The ath power of x, denoted by xa, might be defined as ``the number obtained by multiplying unity a times with x''. Thus (2.5)3 $=$ 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5. This definition makes sense only when a is an integer. However, it is an elementary fact that the definition of the power of a number can be meaningfully and consistently extended to real anil even complex values of a. Likewise, the original definition of the derivative of a function makes sense only for integral orders, i.e. we can speak of the first or second derivative and so on. However, it is possible to extend the definition of the derivative to noninteger orders by using an elementary properly of Fourier transforms. Bracewell shows how fractional derivatives can be used to characterize the discontinuities of certain funct ions \[1\]. An example from the field of optics is related to the Talbot effect \[2\], in which self-images of an input object are observed at the 2-D planes z --- Nz0 for integer N (z is the axial coordinate and z0 a characteristic distance). Using a self-transformation technique \[3\], it was shown that N could also take on certain rational values},

Cutting that piece of GRIN fiber into shorter pieces corresponds to splitting the ordinary Fourier transform into fractional transforms. I approach the subject of fractional Fourier transforms in two other ways. First, I point out the algorithmic isomorphism among image rotation, rotation of the Wigner distribution function, and fractional Fourier transforming.

abstract = {This tutorial gives an overview of the use of the Wigner function as a tool for modeling optical field propagation. Particular emphasis is placed on the spatial propagation of stationary fields, as well as on the propagation of pulses through dispersive media. In the first case, the Wigner function gives a representation of the field that is similar to a radiance or weight distribution for all the rays in the system, since its arguments are both position and direction. In cases in which the field is paraxial and where the system is described by a simple linear relation in the ray regime, the Wigner function is constant under propagation along rays. An equivalent property holds for optical pulse propagation in dispersive media under analogous assumptions. Several properties and applications of the Wigner function in these contexts are discussed, as is its connection with other common phase-space distributions like the ambiguity function, the spectrogram, and the Husimi, P, Q, and Kirkwood--Rihaczek functions. Also discussed are modifications to the definition of the Wigner function that allow extending the property of conservation along paths to a wider range of problems, including nonparaxial field propagation and pulse propagation within general transparent dispersive media.},

Certainly, since the ordinary Fourier transform is merely a particular case of a continuous set of fractional Fourier domains, every property and application of the ordinary Fourier transform becomes a special case of the fractional Fourier transform. Despite the great practical importance of the discrete Fourier transform, implementation of fractional orders of the corresponding discrete operation has been elusive. Here we report classical and quantum optical realizations of the discrete fractional Fourier transform. In the context of classical optics, we implement discrete fractional Fourier transforms of exemplary wave functions and experimentally demonstrate the shift theorem. Moreover, we apply this approach in the quantum realm to Fourier transform separable and path-entangled biphoton wave functions. The proposed approach is versatile and could find applications in various fields where Fourier transforms are essential tools.},

Combined with frequency offset and phase estimation algorithms, simulations show that PDM quadrature phase-shift keying signals can be coherently detected by the proposed scheme using commercial semiconductor lasers while no optical phase locking and polarization control are required. This analogy further suggests the potential application of space-time coding in wireless communications to optical polarization MIMO systems and relates the problem of polarization-mode dispersion in fiber transmission to the multi-path propagation in wireless communications.},

In this paper, we present experimental verification of QKD co-propagating with a large number of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) coherent data channels. We show successful secret key generation over 24 h for a continuous-variable QKD channel jointly transmitted with 100 WDM channels of erbium doped fiber amplified polarization multiplexed 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation signals amounting to a datarate of 18.3 Tbit/s. Compared to previous co-propagation results in the C-band, we demonstrate more than a factor of 10 increase in the number of WDM channels and more than 90 times higher classical bitrate, showing the co-propagation with Tbit/s data-carrying channels.},

Two main schemes are proposed and analyzed in detail, considering system imperfections, specifically, time misalignment issues. It turns out that while multiple service providers can share the network infrastructure using the proposed multiplexing techniques, no gain in the total secret key generation rate is obtained if one uses conventional passive all-optical OFDM decoders. To achieve a linear increase in the key rate with the number of channels, an alternative active setup for OFDM decoding is proposed, which employs an optical switch in addition to conventional passive circuits. We show that by using our proposed decoder, the bandwidth utilization is considerably improved as compared to conventional wavelength-division multiplexing techniques.},

  abstract  = {Nonlocality, which is the key feature of quantum theory, has been linked with the uncertainty principle by fine-grained uncertainty relations, by considering combinations of outcomes for different measurements. However, this approach assumes that information about the system to be fine-grained is local, and does not present an explicitly computable bound. Here, we generalize above approach to general quasi-fine-grained uncertainty relations (QFGURs) which applies in the presence of quantum memory and provides conspicuously computable bounds to quantitatively link the uncertainty to entanglement and Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) steering, respectively. Moreover, our QFGURs provide a framework to unify three important forms of uncertainty relations, i.e., universal uncertainty relations, the uncertainty principle in the presence of quantum memory, and fine-grained uncertainty relation. This result gives a direct significance to uncertainty principle, and allows us to determine whether a quantum measurement exhibits typical quantum correlations, meanwhile, it reveals a fundamental connection between basic elements of quantum theory, specifically, uncertainty measures, combined outcomes for different measurements, quantum memory, entanglement and EPR steering.},

Extending the theory presented in our previous publications, in this paper we take into account the finite time aperture of the imaging system, characterized by its pupil function. Using the quantum theory, we obtain a unitary transformation of the quantum field from the input to the output of the imaging scheme and identify the contribution of the vacuum fluctuations missing in the classical theory. This contribution plays a key role in the quantum temporal imaging of nonclassical temporal waveforms, characterized by nonclassical fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. As an example, we consider quantum temporal imaging of broadband squeezed light and formulate the criteria for conservation of its squeezing properties at the output of the system.},

  abstract  = {Conventional quantum key distribution (QKD) typically uses binary encoding based on photon polarization or time-bin degrees of freedom and achieves a key capacity of at most one bit per photon. Under photon-starved conditions the rate of detection events is much lower than the photon generation rate, because of losses in long distance propagation and the relatively long recovery times of available single-photon detectors. Multi-bit encoding in the photon arrival times can be beneficial in such photon-starved situations. Recent security proofs indicate high-dimensional encoding in the photon arrival times is robust and can be implemented to yield high secure throughput. In this work we demonstrate entanglement-based QKD with high-dimensional encoding whose security against collective Gaussian attacks is provided by a high-visibility Franson interferometer. We achieve unprecedented key capacity and throughput for an entanglement-based QKD system because of four principal factors: Franson interferometry that does not degrade with loss; error correction coding that can tolerate high error rates; optimized time–energy entanglement generation; and highly efficient WSi superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. The secure key capacity yields as much as 8.7 bits per coincidence. When optimized for throughput we observe a secure key rate of 2.7 Mbit s−1 after 20 km fiber transmission with a key capacity of 6.9 bits per photon coincidence. Our results demonstrate a viable approach to high-rate QKD using practical photonic entanglement and single-photon detection technologies.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic emission technique (AET) is a well-known non-destructive testing method used for the detection of crack growth and monitoring structural integrity of components. The main limitation in the application of AET is the fact that acoustic emission (AE) signal is often affected by background noise. A new approach is proposed in this paper to reduce the background noise and to improve the accuracy of AE signal detection. Various noise reduction methods have been applied and studied for AE signal enhancement so far. Some of the studies proved that self-adaptive noise cancellation (SANC) and adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) are better techniques for denoising the AE signal. This paper proposes the use of ANC and SANC schemes based on Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) for AE signal enhancement. FrFT is the generalization of the classical Fourier Transform (FT). The use of FrFT gives an advantage of an additional degree of freedom (angle of rotation in time–frequency plane) over the traditional Fourier transform and could provide improved performance. In this method, the noisy signal is rotated in time- frequency plane to extract the signal in Fractional Fourier domain (FrFD). Two adaptive filters viz. least mean squares and normalized least mean squares are studied for FrFD based ANC approach. The performance of the proposed method is validated using real AE signals acquired from three different experiments: pencil lead break test, composite drilling test and concrete compression test. Results are compared with the time and frequency domain adaptations. Moreover, the results have also been compared with the frequency domain adaptation techniques. Results have demonstrated that FrFD based ANC approach outperforms the conventional time domain and frequency domain adaptive filtering with an improved signal to noise ratio and significantly reduces mean square error.},

As a consequence, frequency and time operators can be used to define a universal set of gates in this particular subspace.

  abstract  = {From telecommunications to computing architectures, the realm of classical information hinges on converter technology to enable the exchange of data between digital and analogue formats, a process now routinely performed across a variety of electronic devices. A similar exigency also exists in quantum information technology, where different frameworks are being developed for quantum computing, communication and sensing. Thus, efficient quantum interconnects are a major need to bring these parallel approaches together and scale up quantum information systems. So far, however, the conversion between different optical quantum-bit encodings has remained challenging due to the difficulty of preserving fragile quantum superpositions and the demanding requirements for postselection-free implementations. Here we demonstrate such a conversion of quantum information between the two main paradigms, namely discrete- and continuous-variable qubits. We certify the protocol on a complete set of single-photon qubits, successfully converting them to cat-state qubits with fidelities exceeding the classical limit. Our result demonstrates an essential tool for enabling interconnected quantum devices and architectures with enhanced versatility and scalability.},

  abstract  = {Photonic systems provide access to extremely large bandwidths, which can approach a petahertz1. Unfortunately, full utilization of this bandwidth is not achievable using standard electro-optical technologies, and higher ({\textgreater}100 GHz) performance requires all-optical processing with nonlinear-optical elements. A solution to the implementation of these elements in robust, compact and efficient systems is emerging in photonic integrated circuits, as evidenced by their recent application in various ultrahigh-bandwidth instruments2,3,4. These devices enable the characterization of extremely complex signals by linking the high-speed optical domain with slower speed electronics. Here, we extend the application of these devices beyond characterization and demonstrate an instrument that generates complex and rapidly updateable ultrafast optical waveforms. We generate waveforms with 1.5-ps minimum features by compressing lower-bandwidth replicas created with a 10 GHz electro-optic modulator. In effect, our device allows for ultrahigh-speed direct 270 GHz modulation using relatively low speed devices and represents a new class of ultrafast waveform generators.},

The canonical additive white Gaussian noise model is used to describe the propagation of the optical signal. The Holevo limit exceeds substantially the standard Shannon limit when the power spectral density of noise acquired in the course of propagation is small compared to the energy of a single photon at the carrier frequency per unit time-bandwidth area. General results are illustrated with a discussion of efficient communication strategies in the photon-starved regime.},

  abstract = {Chirp waveform plays a significant role in radar and communication systems for its ability of pulse compression and spread spectrum. This paper presents a principle of multiplexing a bank of orthogonal chirps, termed orthogonal chirp-division multiplexing (OCDM) for high-speed communication. As Fourier transform is the kernel of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which achieves the maximum spectral efficiency (SE) of frequency-division multiplexing, Fresnel transform underlies the proposed OCDM system, which achieves the maximum SE of chirp spread spectrum. By using discrete Fresnel transform, digital implementation of OCDM is introduced. According to the properties of Fresnel transform, the transmission of OCDM signal in linear time-invariant channel is studied. Efficient digital signal processing is proposed for channel dispersion compensation. The implementation of the OCDM system is discussed with the emphasis on its compatibility to the OFDM system; it is shown that it can be easily integrated into the existing OFDM systems. Finally, the simulations are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed OCDM. It is shown that the OCDM system can efficiently exploit multipath diversity and thus outperforms the OFDM, and that it is more resilient against the interference due to insufficient guard interval than single-carrier frequency-domain equalization.},

Both of these configurations have been successfully used for temporal imaging of classical temporal waveforms. We demonstrate that for quantum temporal imaging, precisely, temporal imaging of broadband squeezed light, these two schemes have very different behavior: the PC configuration deteriorates squeezing, while the PP configuration leaves it intact. These results are very important for the applications of temporal imaging for quantum communications and quantum information processing.},

Significant improvement has been made in the areas of imaging, positioning, timing, interferometry, communication, and information processing through quantum detection and estimation techniques. In this Letter, we focus on the application of quantum information for spectral measurements. Specifically, we study the quantum limit to resolve two spectral modes with small frequency separation. We show that frequency superresolution can be achieved with spectrotemporal shaping of input fields before detection. Through a numerical optimization algorithm, we design the apparatus for spectrotemporal shaping based on phase modulation and dispersion engineering. This scheme can achieve performance close to the quantum limit with minimum resources, showing the robustness for experimental implementation and real-world applications.},

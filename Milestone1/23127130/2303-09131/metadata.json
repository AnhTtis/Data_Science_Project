    "abstract": "Some time ago it was suggested that dark matter may consist in part of an extremely dilute gas of supermassive fractionally charged gravitinos \\cite{MeissnerNicolai2019}. This scheme makes the definite (and falsifiable) prediction that massive gravitinos are the only new fermionic degrees of freedom beyond the known three generations of quarks and leptons of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. In this note we re-examine one special event reported and subsequently discarded by the MACRO collaboration \\cite{MACRO,MACRO1} in the light of this proposal.",

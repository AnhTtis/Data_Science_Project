\gx{I checked multiple surveys published in ACM computing survey, they all don't have Limitation section, so let's leave this section as the low priority for now}

\jr{Limitations: the things that are outside of our scope, but still may of interest to the readers}

Limitation 1.only limit the venues to be A* ranked may limit the papers in our collection. 
Due to the large amount of literature on adversarial robustness of machine learning models in recent years,we focused on literature found from limited number of publication venues and application domains, which may potentially overlook some relevant work. 
We tried to eliminate such situation by performing `backward snowballing', identifying the related work discussed in the as previous or concurrent work by the papers we identified. 

Threat 1. paper selection standard difference among the authors may unwittingly miss relevant work. 
As we distributed paper filtering tasks among the authors, the slight difference in authors' selection standards may unintentionally excluded relevant work,
however, we tried to be as conservative as possible when excluding work, and actively discussed regarding uncertain papers during the filtering process.

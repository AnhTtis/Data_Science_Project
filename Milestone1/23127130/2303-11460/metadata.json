    "abstract": "We examine the buckling shape and critical compression of confined inhomogeneous composite sheets lying on a liquid foundation. The buckling modes are controlled by the bending stiffness of the sheet, the density of the substrate, and the size and the spatially dependent elastic coefficients of the sheet. We solve the (linearized) Föppl-von Kármán equations describing the mechanical equilibrium of a sheet when its bending stiffness varies parallel to the direction of confinement. The case of a homogeneous bending stiffness exhibits a degeneracy of wrinkled states for certain sizes of the confined sheet. This degeneracy disappears for spatially dependent elastic coefficients. Medium length sheets buckle similarly to their homogeneous counterparts, whereas the wrinkled states in large length sheets localize the bending energy towards the soft regions of the sheet.",

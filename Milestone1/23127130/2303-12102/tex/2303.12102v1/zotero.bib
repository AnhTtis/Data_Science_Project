A custom-built wide-field camera provides a 47 deg2 field of view and 8 s readout time, yielding more than an order of magnitude improvement in survey speed relative to its predecessor survey, the Palomar Transient Factory. We describe the design and implementation of the camera and observing system. The ZTF data system at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center provides near-real-time reduction to identify moving and varying objects. We outline the analysis pipelines, data products, and associated archive. Finally, we present on-sky performance analysis and first scientific results from commissioning and the early survey. ZTF's public alert stream will serve as a useful precursor for that of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

  abstract = {The discovery of activity emanating from asteroid (4015) Wilson-Harrington in 1950 (Harris, 1950) prompted astronomers to realize that comet-like activity, such as comae and tails, is not limited to comets. Fewer than 30 of these ``active asteroids'' have been discovered (Chandler et al., 2018) in the last 70 years, yet they promise to hold clues about fundamental physical and chemical processes at play in our solar system (Jewitt, 2012; Hsieh et al., 2015a). Activity is attributed to sublimation for roughly half of these objects, highlighting asteroids as a ``volatile reservoir.'' In this context a volatile reservoir is any dynamical group of bodies in the solar system that is known to harbor volatiles. Understanding the past and present volatile distribution in the solar system has broad implications ranging from informing future space exploration pro- grams to helping us understand how planetary systems form with volatiles prerequisite to life as we know it, especially water. Notably, the origin of Earth's water is essentially unknown, although it is now believed that asteroids account for at least some of the terrestrial volatile budget (Alexander, 2017). A second volatile reservoir came to light following the 1977 discovery of Centaur (2060) Chiron (Kowal \& Gehrels, 1977). Centaurs, found between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune, are thought to be icy objects originating from the Kuiper Belt, a circumstellar region between the orbit of Neptune (30 au) and about 50 au from the Sun (Jewitt, 2009). The Kuiper Belt is roughly 200 times more massive than the Asteroid Belt. Nevertheless, active Centaurs are also rare, with fewer than 20 discovered to date (Chandler et al., 2020). We set out to increase the number of known active objects in order to (1) enable the study of these active objects as populations, and (2) search for new volatile reservoirs. I proposed to the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) to create a Citizen Science project designed to carry out an outreach program while searching through millions of images of known asteroids in order to find previously unknown active objects. My proposal was selected for funding, and on 31 August 2022 we successfully launched Active Asteroids (http://activeasteroids.net), a NASA Partner, and discoveries have been abundant ever since. In this dissertation I present (1) Hunting for Activity in Repositories with Vetting-Enhanced Search Techniques (HARVEST), a pipeline that extracts images of known solar system objects for presentation to Citizen Scientists, (2) our proof-of-concept demonstrating Dark Energy Camera (DECam) images are well- suited for activity detection (Chandler et al., 2018), (3) how we discovered a potential new recurrent activity mechanism (Chandler et al., 2019), (4) a Centaur activity discovery plus a novel technique for estimating which species are sublimating (Chandler et al., 2020), (5) how our discovery of an additional activity epoch for an active asteroid enabled us to classify the object as a member of the Main-belt Comet (MBC) (Chandler et al., 2021b), a rare ({$<$} 10) active asteroid subset that orbits in the Asteroid Belt that is known for sublimation-driven activity, (6) a dynamical pathway that can explain the presence of some of the active asteroids, and (7) the Citizen Science project Active Asteroids, including initial results.},

Active Centaurs enigmatically display comet-like features (e.g., tails, comae) even though they orbit in the gas giant region where it is too cold for water to readily sublimate. Only 18 active Centaurs have been identified since 1927 and, consequently, the underlying activity mechanism(s) have remained largely unknown up to this point. Here we report the discovery of activity emanating from Centaur 2014 OG392, based on archival images we uncovered plus our own new observational evidence acquired with the Dark Energy Camera (Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory Blanco 4 m telescope), the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera \& Spectrograph (Las Campanas Observatory 6.5 m Walter Baade Telescope), and the Large Monolithic Imager (Lowell Observatory 4.3 m Discovery Channel Telescope). We detect a coma as far as 400,000 km from 2014 OG392, and our novel analysis of sublimation processes and dynamical lifetime suggest carbon dioxide and/or ammonia are the most likely candidates for causing activity on this and other active Centaurs. We find 2014 OG392 is optically red, but CO2 and NH3 are spectrally neutral in this wavelength regime so the reddening agent is as yet unidentified.},

  abstract = {We report that object 282P/(323137) 2003 BM80 is undergoing a sustained activity outburst, lasting over 15 months thus far. These findings stem in part from our NASA Partner Citizen Science project Active Asteroids (http://activeasteroids.net), which we introduce here. We acquired new observations of 282P via our observing campaign (Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT), Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), and the Gemini South telescope), confirming 282P was active on UT 2022 June 7, some 15 months after 2021 March images showed activity in the 2021-2022 epoch. We classify 282P as a member of the quasi-Hilda objects (QHOs), a group of dynamically unstable objects found in an orbital region similar to, but distinct in their dynamical characteristics to, the Hilda asteroids (objects in 3:2 resonance with Jupiter). Our dynamical simulations show 282P has undergone at least five close encounters with Jupiter and one with Saturn over the last 180 yr. 282P was most likely a Centaur or Jupiter-family comet (JFC) 250 yr ago. In 350 yr, following some 15 strong Jovian interactions, 282P will most likely migrate to become a JFC or, less likely, an outer main-belt asteroid orbit. These migrations highlight a dynamical pathway connecting Centaurs and JFCs with quasi-Hildas and, potentially, active asteroids. Synthesizing these results with our thermodynamical modeling and new activity observations, we find volatile sublimation is the primary activity mechanism. Observations of a quiescent 282P, which we anticipate will be possible in 2023, will help confirm our hypothesis by measuring a rotation period and ascertaining the spectral type. * Based on observations obtained at the international Gemini Observatory, a program of NSF's NOIRLab, which is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation on behalf of the Gemini Observatory partnership: the National Science Foundation (United States), National Research Council (Canada), Agencia Nacional de Investigaci\'on y Desarrollo (Chile), Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnolog\'ia e Innovaci\'on (Argentina), Minist\'erio da Ci\^encia, Tecnologia, Inova\c{c}\~oes e Comunica\c{c}\~oes (Brazil), and Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (Republic of Korea). ** Magellan telescope time was granted by NSF's NOIRLab, through the Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP).

We discovered evidence of this second activity epoch in an image captured 2016 July 22 with the DECam on the 4 m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. As of this writing, (248370) 2005 QN173 is just the eighth active asteroid demonstrated to undergo recurrent activity near perihelion. Our analyses demonstrate (248370) 2005 QN173 is likely a member of the active asteroid subset known as main-belt comets, a group of objects that orbit in the main asteroid belt that exhibit activity that is specifically driven by sublimation. We implement an activity detection technique, wedge photometry, that has the potential to detect tails in images of solar system objects and quantify their agreement with computed antisolar and antimotion vectors normally associated with observed tail directions. We present a catalog and an image gallery of archival observations. The object will soon become unobservable as it passes behind the Sun as seen from Earth, and when it again becomes visible (late 2022) it will be farther than 3 au from the Sun. Our findings suggest (248370) 2005 QN173 is most active interior to 2.7 au (0.3 au from perihelion), so we encourage the community to observe and study this special object before 2021 December.},

For over 15,000 comets and asteroids, 60 natural satellites, and 9 planets, users with an Internet connection can easily create and download information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These data include customized, high precision ephemerides, orbital and physical characteristics, and search-lists of comets and asteroids that match combinations of up to 39 different parameters. For each body, the user can request computation of more than 70 orbital and physical quantities. Ephemerides output can be generated in ICRF/J2000.0 and FK4/1950.0 reference frames with TDB, TT, or UTC timescales, as appropriate, at user specified intervals. Computed tables are derived from the same ephemerides used at JPL for radar astronomy and spacecraft navigation. The dynamics and computed observables include relativistic effects. Available ephemeris time spans currently range from A.D. 1599-2200 for the planets to a few decades for the satellites, comets and asteroids. Information on the interference from sunlight and moonlight is available. As an example of a few of the features available, we note that a user could easily generate information on satellite and planetary magnitudes, illuminated fractions, and the planetographic longitudes and latitudes of their centers and sub-solar points as seen from a particular observatory location on Earth. Satellite transits, occultations and eclipses are available as well. The resulting ASCII tables can be transferred to the user's host computer via e-mail, ftp, or kermit protocols. For those who have WWW access, the telnet solar system ephemeris service will be one feature of the JPL solar system web page. This page will provide up-to-date physical and orbital characteristics as well as current and predicted observing opportunities for all solar system bodies. Close Earth approaches and radar observations will be provided for comets and asteroids.},

  abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

PS1 comet detection procedures currently consist of the comparison of the point spread functions (PSFs) of moving objects to those of reference stars, and the flagging of objects that show anomalously large radial PSF widths for human evaluation and possible observational follow-up. Based on the number of missed discovery opportunities among comets discovered by other observers, we estimate an upper limit comet discovery efficiency rate of {$\sim$}70\% for PS1. Additional analyses that could improve comet discovery yields in future surveys include linear PSF analysis, modeling of trailed stellar PSFs for comparison to trailed moving object PSFs, searches for azimuthally localized activity, comparison of point-source-optimized photometry to extended-source-optimized photometry, searches for photometric excesses in objects with known absolute magnitudes, and crowd-sourcing. Analysis of the discovery statistics of the PS1 survey indicates an expected fraction of 59 MBCs per 106 outer main-belt asteroids (corresponding to a total expected population of {$\sim$}140 MBCs among the outer main-belt asteroid population with absolute magnitudes of 12},

We identify evidence of activity in observations of 238P in 2021, and find similar inferred activity onset times and net initial mass loss rates for 238P during perihelion approaches in 2010, 2016, and 2021. P/2016 J1-A and P/2016 J1-B are also found to be active in 2021 and 2022, making them collectively the tenth MBC confirmed to be recurrently active near perihelion and therefore likely to be exhibiting sublimation-driven activity. The nucleus of 313P is found to have colors of g'-r'=0.52+/-0.05 and r'-i'=0.22+/-0.07, consistent with 313P being a Lixiaohua family member. We also report non-detections of P/2015 X6 (PANSTARRS), where we conclude that its current nucleus size is likely below our detection limits (r\_n{$<$}0.3 km). Lastly, we find that of 17 MBCs or candidate MBCs for which nucleus sizes (or inferred parent body sizes) have been estimated, {$>$}80\% have r\_n{$<$}1.0 km, pointing to an apparent physical preference toward small MBCs, where we suggest that YORP spin-up may play a significant role in triggering and/or facilitating MBC activity.},

These processes were either unsuspected or thought to lie beyond the realm of observation before the discovery of asteroid activity. Scientific interest in the active asteroids lies in their promise to open new avenues into the direct study of asteroid destruction, the production of interplanetary debris, the abundance of asteroid ice, and the origin of terrestrial planet volatiles.},

The system requires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels alone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the "lost in space" problem in which nothing-not even the image scale-is known. After robust source detection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five stars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate hypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as true if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a null hypothesis. With indices built from the USNO-B catalog and designed for uniformity of coverage and redundancy, the success rate is {$>$}99.9\% for contemporary near-ultraviolet and visual imaging survey data, with no false positives. The failure rate is consistent with the incompleteness of the USNO-B catalog; augmentation with indices built from the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog brings the completeness to 100\% with no false positives. We are using this system to generate consistent and standards-compliant meta-data for digital and digitized imaging from plate repositories, automated observatories, individual scientific investigators, and hobbyists. This is the first step in a program of making it possible to trust calibration meta-data for astronomical data of arbitrary provenance.},

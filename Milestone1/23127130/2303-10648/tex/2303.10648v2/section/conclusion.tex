By connecting {results} on velocity-dissipativity/stability and universal shifted dissipativity/stability with data-driven {controller design}, we have shown that the data-driven velocity-form of a general NL system with full state-observation enables direct data-driven control of NL systems with \new{equilibrium independent} stability and performance guarantees. The elegance {and effectiveness} of this concept is demonstrated on a simulation example of {a NL unbalanced disc} system. The presented concepts in this paper can be seen as the first approach that achieves direct data-driven analysis and control in the general NL setting. For future research, we aim to use the data-driven velocity-form for general NL input-output-representations and derive the corresponding analysis and synthesis methods {under a dynamic output-feedback setting}. \new{Moreover, handling noise and the correct choice for $\psi$ are interesting open problems.}

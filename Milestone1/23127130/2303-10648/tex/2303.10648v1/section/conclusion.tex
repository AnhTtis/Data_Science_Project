By connecting \TR{results} on velocity-dissipativity/stability and universal shifted dissipativity/stability with data-driven \TR{controller design}, we have shown that the data-driven velocity-form of a general NL system with full state-observation enables direct data-driven control of NL systems with global stability and performance guarantees. The elegance \TR{and effectiveness} of this concept is demonstrated on a simulation example of \TR{a nonlinear unbalanced disc} system. The presented concepts in this paper can be seen as the first approach that achieves direct data-driven analysis and control in the general NL setting. For future research, we aim to use the data-driven velocity-form for general NL input-output-representations and derive the corresponding analysis and synthesis methods \TR{under a dynamic output-feedback setting}.


% MERGE THIS IN HERE:
% We want to again emphasize the importance of these results by highlighting that we now have developed a direct data-driven control synthesis method for general nonlinear systems of the form \eqref{eq:NL_sys}. And, although we now have presented only the results for state-feedback, the extension of the direct data-driven analysis and control results for input-output-based LPV representations \cite{VerhoekTothHaesaertKoch2021, Verhoek2023_dissipativity} can be directly applied with the same reasoning, which introduces a direct data-driven control framework for \emph{general} nonlinear systems via the linear parameter-varying framework.

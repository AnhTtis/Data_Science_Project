 
 HI deficiency does not correlate with asymmetry, or the offset of the HI disk, irrespective of environment!
 
Mechanical removal of gas (e.g. RPS, tidal stripping) does not seem to be a dominant process.
Are HI gas disks in HI deficient galaxies truncated?

 
 Yes HI deficient galaxies have smaller HI disks!
but relatively small HI gas disks are
also found in The Swarm galaxies

log(DHI) = 0.506 X log(MHI) - 3.293


HI deficient galaxies have relatively small gas disk : DHI < Dopt

The smaller gas disks are not necessarily offset or disturbed

Mechanical removal of gas (e.g. RPS, tidal stripping) does not seem to be a dominant process.

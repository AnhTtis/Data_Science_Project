    "abstract": "This paper presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting solar\npower generation with high accuracy using a 99% AUC (Area Under the Curve)\nmetric. The approach includes data collection, pre-processing, feature\nselection, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. High-quality\ndata from multiple sources, including weather data, solar irradiance data, and\nhistorical solar power generation data, are collected and pre-processed to\nremove outliers, handle missing values, and normalize the data. Relevant\nfeatures such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar irradiance are\nselected for model training. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and\nGradient Boosting are used as machine learning algorithms to produce accurate\npredictions. The models are trained on a large dataset of historical solar\npower generation data and other relevant features. The performance of the\nmodels is evaluated using AUC and other metrics such as precision, recall, and\nF1-score. The trained machine learning models are then deployed in a production\nenvironment, where they can be used to make real-time predictions about solar\npower generation. The results show that the proposed approach achieves a 99%\nAUC for solar power generation prediction, which can help energy companies\nbetter manage their solar power systems, reduce costs, and improve energy\nefficiency.",

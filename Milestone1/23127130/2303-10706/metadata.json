    "abstract": "For a graph whose vertices are points in $\\mathbb R^d$, consider the closed balls with diameters induced by its edges. The graph is called a Tverberg graph if these closed balls intersect. A max-sum tree of a finite point set $X \\subset \\mathbb R^d$ is a tree with vertex set $X$ that maximizes the sum of Euclidean distances of its edges among all trees with vertex set $X$. Similarly, a max-sum matching of an even set $X \\subset \\mathbb R^d$ is a perfect matching of $X$ maximizing the sum of Euclidean distances between the matched points among all perfect matchings of $X$. We prove that a max-sum tree of any finite point set in $\\mathbb R^d$ is a Tverberg graph, which generalizes a recent result of Abu-Affash et al., who established this claim in the plane. Additionally, we provide a new proof of a theorem by Bereg et al., which states that a max-sum matching of any even point set in the plane is a Tverberg graph. Moreover, we proved a slightly stronger version of this theorem.",

    "abstract": "This paper designs a distributed least square solution method for a linear algebraic equation over a multiagent network. The coefficient matrix is divided into multiple blocks, and each agent only knows a subset of these blocks. The designed method is discrete-time and based on a proximal ADMM algorithm. By applying the designed method, each agent can find its corresponding part in one least square solution of the considered linear algebraic equation while using only its information and communicating with its neighbors. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the designed method in MATLAB.",

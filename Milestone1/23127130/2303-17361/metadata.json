    "abstract": "We show that symmetrically padded convolution can be analytically inverted via DFT. We comprehensively analyze several different symmetric and anti-symmetric padding modes and show that multiple cases exist where the inversion can be achieved. The implementation is available at \\url{https://github.com/prclibo/iconv_dft}.",

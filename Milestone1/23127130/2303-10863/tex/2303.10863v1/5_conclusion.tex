\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a promising and important research task: Few-shot Scene Graph Generation (FSSGG), which requires SGG models to be able to recognize novel predicate categories quickly with only a few samples. Different from existing FSL tasks, the multiple semantics and great variance of the visual appearance of predicate categories make FSSGG non-trivial. To this end, we devised a novel Decomposable Prototype Learning (DPL). Specifically, we introduced learnable prompts to model multiple semantics of predicates with the help of pretrained VL models and adaptively assigned weights to each support sample by considering the subject-object compositions.
To better benchmark FSSGG, we re-splited the prevalent VG dataset and evaluated several FSL methods on the new split for future research. We hope this work can inspire and attract FSL research on more challenging scene understanding tasks.

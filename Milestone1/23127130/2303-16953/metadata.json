    "abstract": "We propose a data-assisted two-stage method for solving an inverse random source problem of the Helmholtz equation. In the first stage, the regularized Kaczmarz method is employed to generate initial approximations of the mean and variance based on the mild solution of the stochastic Helmholtz equation. A dataset is then obtained by sampling the approximate and corresponding true profiles from a certain a-priori criterion. The second stage is formulated as an image-to-image translation problem, and several data-assisted approaches are utilized to handle the dataset and obtain enhanced reconstructions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the data-assisted two-stage method provides satisfactory reconstruction for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media with fewer realizations.",

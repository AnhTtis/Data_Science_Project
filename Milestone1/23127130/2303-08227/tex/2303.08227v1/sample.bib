	abstract = {Hall-effect thrusters ({HETs}) are widely used for modern near-earth spacecraft propulsion and are vital for future deep-space missions. Methods of modeling {HETs} are developing rapidly. However, such methods are not yet precise enough and cannot reliably predict the parameters of a newly designed thruster, mostly due to the enormous computational cost of a {HET} plasma simulation. Another approach is to use scaling techniques based on available experimental data. This paper proposes an approach for scaling {HETs} using neural networks and other modern machine learning methods. The new scaling model was built with information from an extensive database of {HET} parameters collected from published papers. Predictions of the new scaling model are valid for the operating parameters domain covered by the database. During the design, this model can help {HET} developers estimate the performance of a newly-designed thruster. At the stage of experimental research, the model can be used to compare the achieved characteristics of the studied thruster with the level obtained by other developers. A comparison with the state-of-the-art {HET} scaling model is also presented.},

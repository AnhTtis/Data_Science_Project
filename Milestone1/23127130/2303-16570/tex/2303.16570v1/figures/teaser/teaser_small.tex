\emakefirstuc{\name{}} learns strong and transferable point cloud representations in a self-supervised manner.
During training, a teacher network\,\colorsquare{m_green} predicts latent representations using a complete view of the point cloud.
The student network\,\colorsquare{m_blue} predicts the same representations, but from a partial view.
A shallow decoder\,\colorsquare{m_red} then reconstructs the latent representations  of masked regions\,\colordot{black}, which we can use to train the student and the decoder, whereas the teacher uses an exponential moving average of the student weights.

        \textbf{Confusion matrix of \name{} on the ModelNet40 test split.}
        We present the confusion matrix, both row-normalized (a) and column-normalized (b).
        The diagonals of these show the recall and precision respectively.
        As expected, the matrix reveals that the majority of misclassifications occur between a small number of closely related classes.
        The most frequent cases of misclassifications are \texttt{night\_stand}s that are classified as \texttt{dresser}s, \texttt{flower\_pot}s that are classified as \texttt{plant}s and \texttt{table}s that are classified as \texttt{desk}s.

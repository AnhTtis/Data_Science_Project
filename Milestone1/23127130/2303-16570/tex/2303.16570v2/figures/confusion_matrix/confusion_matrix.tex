        \textbf{Confusion matrix of \name{} on the ModelNet40 test split.}
        We present the confusion matrix, both row-normalized (a) and column-normalized (b).
        The diagonals of these show the recall and precision respectively.
        As expected, the matrix reveals that the majority of misclassifications occur between a small number of closely related classes.
        The most frequent cases of misclassifications are `\emph{night\_stand}'s that are classified as `\emph{dresser}'s, `\emph{flower\_pot}'s that are classified as `\emph{plant}'s and `\emph{table}'s that are classified as `\emph{desk}'s.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have extended data2vec to the point cloud domain.
Through an in-depth analysis, we have discovered that the disclosure of positional information to the student network hampers data2vec's ability to learn strong representations on point clouds.
To overcome this limitation, we have introduced \name{}, a self-supervised representation learning approach which unleashes the full potential of data2vec-like pre-training on point clouds.
\emakefirstuc{\name{}} achieves remarkable results on various downstream tasks, surpassing other self-supervised learning approaches in few-shot learning as well as shape classification on well-established benchmarks.
Future work might include extending \name{} for scene-level representation learning. %

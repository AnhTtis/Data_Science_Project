    \captionof{figure}{\textbf{SCADE Overview}. We present SCADE, a novel technique for NeRF reconstruction under \emph{sparse, unconstrained views} for in-the-wild indoor scenes. We leverage on generalizable monocular depth priors and address to represent the inherent ambiguities of monocular depth by exploiting our \textbf{ambiguity-aware depth estimates} (left). Our approach accounts for \emph{multimodality} of both distributions using our novel \emph{space carving loss} that seeks to \emph{disambiguate} and find the common mode to \emph{fuse} the information between different views (middle). SCADE enables better photometric reconstruction especially in highly ambiguous scenes, \eg non-opaque surfaces (right). \vspace{-0.1cm}

    "abstract": "The precision measurements of galactic cosmic ray protons from PAMELA and AMS are reproduced using a well-established 3D numerical model for the period July 2006 - November 2019. The resulting modulation parameters are applied to simulate the modulation for cosmic antiprotons over the same period, which includes times of minimum modulation before and after 2009, maximum modulation from 2012 to 2015 including the reversal of the Sun's magnetic field polarity, and the approach to new minimum modulation in 2020. Apart from their local interstellar spectra, the modulation of protons and antiprotons differ only in their charge-sign and consequent drift pattern. The lowest proton flux was in February-March 2014, but the lowest simulated antiproton flux is found to be in March-April 2015. These simulated fluxes are used to predict the proton to anti-proton ratios as a function of rigidity. The trends in these ratios contribute to clarify to a large extent the phenomenon of charge-sign dependence of heliospheric modulation during vastly different phases of the solar activity cycle. This is reiterated and emphasized by displaying so-called hysteresis loops. It is also illustrated how the values of the parallel and perpendicular mean free paths, as well as the drift scale, vary with rigidity over this extensive period. The drift scale is found to be at its lowest level during the polarity reversal period, while the lowest level of the mean free paths are found to be in March-April 2015.",

\caption{Performance gain observed from self-training given varying number of unlabeled retrieved posts (and their associated comments).
%the retrieved image-text pairs used in the self-training. 
X-axis: within each dataset, the bars from left to right indicate self-training with varying number of posts ($K$); y-axis: the difference in F1 between our Full Model and Base Classifier.
%the different value of $K$. 
%Y-axis represents the performance gain compared with related base models.

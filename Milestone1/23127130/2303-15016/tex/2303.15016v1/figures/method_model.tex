\caption{
The workflow of comment-aware self-training. 
Given a post (image-text pair), we first query similar posts and their comments in a retrieval module.
Then the retrieved data is employed in teacher-student training as unlabeled data, where student model is trained with CE (cross-entropy)  and Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence loss.
%The proposed retrieval-based comment-aware self-training framework. 
%The CE loss indicates the cross-entropy loss and KL loss represents the KL divergence loss. 
%representations encoded from texts (bottom), captions (upper left), and images (upper right).
%The encoded captions and texts are compared at output layer in visual-textual contexts.
%Multi-head attentions are employed to explore text-caption and image-text interactions. 
%The attended images, captions, and max-pooled texts are integrated to predict the discourse labels.

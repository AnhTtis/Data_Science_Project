    "abstract": "Within academia and industry, there has been a need for expansive simulation frameworks that include model-based simulation of sensors, mobile vehicles, and the environment around them. To this end, the modular, real-time, and open-source AirSim framework has been a popular community-built system that fulfills some of those needs. However, the framework required adding systems to serve some complex industrial applications, including designing and testing new sensor modalities, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), autonomous navigation algorithms, and transfer learning with machine learning models. In this work, we discuss the modification and additions to our open-source version of the AirSim simulation framework, including new sensor modalities, vehicle types, and methods to generate realistic environments with changeable objects procedurally. Furthermore, we show the various applications and use cases the framework can serve.",

\caption{Career stage statistics of the Queer in AI community members. Data was collected via the demographic surveys (\S\ref{ssec:demosurvey}). Write-in responses were aggregated by a team of Queer in AI organizers. ``Unaggregated’' refers to responses that could not be adequately described with any subset of other categories; however, responses in this group may overlap with the remaining categories. For categories with $\leq3$ responses (marked by *), exact numbers are omitted to protect anonymity.\\ 
\emph{Note: the 2020 survey did not differentiate between the graduate and undergraduate student respondents; here we report the combined total of these two groups under ``Graduate student''.} \label{fig:comm_career}}

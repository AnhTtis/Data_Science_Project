abstract = {Quantum optical Gaussian states are a type of important robust quantum states which are manipulatable by the existing technologies. So far, most of the important quantum information experiments are done with such states, including bright Gaussian light and weak Gaussian light. Extending the existing results of quantum information with discrete quantum states to the case of continuous variable quantum states is an interesting theoretical job. The quantum Gaussian states play a central role in such a case. We review the properties and applications of Gaussian states in quantum information with emphasis on the fundamental concepts, the calculation techniques and the effects of imperfections of the real-life experimental setups. Topics here include the elementary properties of Gaussian states and relevant quantum information device, entanglement-based quantum tasks such as quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography with weak and strong Gaussian states and the quantum channel capacity, mathematical theory of quantum entanglement and state estimation for Gaussian states.}

abstract = {It has been shown that the quantum state of the graviton field outside a black hole horizon carries information about the internal state of the hole. We explain how this allows unitary evaporation: the final radiation state is a complex superposition which depends linearly on the initial black hole state. Under time reversal, the radiation state evolves back to the original black hole quantum state. Formulations of the information paradox on a fixed semiclassical geometry describe only a small subset of the evaporation Hilbert space, and do not exclude overall unitarity.}

title = {Resolving Black Hole Information Paradox: Revisited},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {Blackhole remnants are one of the most exotic remnants in our universe, leaving behind several unsolved paradoxes. Resolving the black hole information paradox, in particular, can direct us to numerous engrossing discoveries and provide a decent understanding of the unsolved conventional theories. We readdress the notions underlying the paradox explicitly, beginning from the basic principles. Various theories, explanations, conclusions, their advantages and disadvantages in several works of literature regarding the information paradox and black hole entropy are discussed. Recent developments in the interpretation of the black hole information paradox are reviewed. A congenital solution to this contradiction involves the transition of classical physics to quantum physics. At the centre of the black hole, the space-time theory by Einstein’s general theory of relativity fails. The research suggests that the solution obtained from considering the principles of quantum gravity is quite plausible. This approach also gives a decent explanation towards the recondite hypothesis of tunnelling of black holes to white holes and the interior geometries of white holes.}

By choosing a specific model for the dissipative interaction of the system of interest with its environment, we are able to evaluate the influence functional in closed form and express it in terms of a few parameters such as the phenomenological viscosity coefficient. We show that in the limit h→0 the results obtained from the influence functional formalism reduce to the classical Fokker-Planck equation. In the case of a simple harmonic oscillator with arbitrarily strong damping and at arbitrary temperature, we obtain an explicit expression for the time evolution of the complete density matrix ϱ(x, x′, t) when the system starts in a particular kind of pure state. We compare our results with those of other approaches to the problem of dissipation in quantum mechanics.},

@article{Fleming:Hu:Roura,
	abstract = {We revisit the model of a quantum Brownian oscillator linearly coupled to an environment of quantum oscillators at finite temperature. By introducing a compact and particularly well-suited formulation, we give a rather quick and direct derivation of the master equation and its solutions for general spectral functions and arbitrary temperatures. The flexibility of our approach allows for an immediate generalization to cases with an external force and with an arbitrary number of Brownian oscillators. More importantly, we point out an important mathematical subtlety concerning boundary-value problems for integro-differential equations which led to incorrect master equation coefficients and impacts on the description of nonlocal dissipation effects in all earlier derivations. Furthermore, we provide explicit, exact analytical results for the master equation coefficients and its solutions in a wide variety of cases, including ohmic, sub-ohmic and supra-ohmic environments with a finite cut-off.},

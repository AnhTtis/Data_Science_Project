    abstract = "Monotonicity-preserving interpolants are used in several applications as engineering or computer aided design. In last years some new techniques have been developed. In particular, in Aràndiga (2013) some new methods to design monotone cubic Hermite interpolants for uniform and non-uniform grids are presented and analyzed. They consist on calculating the derivative values introducing the weighted harmonic mean and a non-linear variation. With these changes, the methods obtained are third-order accurate, except in extreme situations. In this paper, a new general mean is used and a third-order interpolant for all cases is gained. We perform several experiments comparing the known techniques as the method proposed by Fritsch and Butland using the Brodlie?s function, PCHIP program of Matlab (Moler, 2004; Wolberg and Alfy, 2002) with the new algorithm."

    abstract = {In the first volume of this journal, Viggo Brun suggested the following modification of Simpson's formula when the points (x0, y0), (x0 + a, y1) and (x0 + a + b, y2) are given: $\underset{{\mathrm{x}}_{0}}{\overset{{\mathrm{x}}_{0}+\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{b}}{\int }}\mathrm{f}\left(\mathrm{x}\right)\mathrm{d}\mathrm{x}\approx \frac{\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{b}}{6}({\mathrm{y}}_{0}+4{\mathrm{y}}_{1}+{\mathrm{y}}_{2})+\frac{\mathrm{b}-\mathrm{a}}{3}({\mathrm{y}}_{2}-{\mathrm{y}}_{0})$. Brun's own deduction was purely geometrical. In the present paper, two analytical deductions are given, one by a Taylor expansion and the other by a quadratic substitution on the independent variable and using the equidistant case. The latter method also gives an error term ((6.2) p. 103) in Brun's formula. The former method is generalized to the "three-eighths rule". Two alternative formulae are given, one ((7.2) p. 105) very simple, another ((7.3) p. 106) more accurate.},

It is an historical predecessor of the notion of a generalized solution in the Sobolev-Schwartz sense. The relationship between multi-valued and generalized solutions of linear differential equations is established.}

The MOC gives rise to two mutually coupled systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). As a special case we consider the Monge--Amp{\`e}re (MA) equation, for which we present a general method of determining the location and number of required boundary conditions. We solve the systems of ODEs using explicit one-step methods (Euler, Runge-Kutta) and spline interpolation. Reformulation of the Monge--Amp{\`e}re equation as an integral equation yields via its residual a proxy for the error of the numerical solution. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance and convergence of the methods.},

For the point characteristic this is usefully achieved by restricting the terminal points of rays to lie on arbitrarily chosen base surfaces, not necessarily planes. Formerly, mixed and angle characteristics with four arguments were defined only for systems with plane base surfaces. It is shown here that the Legendre transforms of the restricted point characteristic of a system with arbitrary base surfaces are further characteristic functions corresponding to mixed and angle characteristics. These new functions (termed restricted mixed characteristics and restricted angle characteristics) complement the existing restricted point characteristic to form a complete set of point, mixed, and angle characteristics all dependent on four variables.},

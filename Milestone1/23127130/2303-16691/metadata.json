    "abstract": "Recent studies have found that fluctuations of magnetization transfer in integrable spin chains violate the central limit property. Here we revisit the problem of anomalous counting statistics in the Landau-Lifshitz field theory by specializing to two distinct anomalous regimes featuring a dynamical critical point. By performing optimized numerical simulations using an integrable space-time discretization we extract the algebraic growth exponents of time-dependent cumulants which attain their threshold values. The distinctly non-Gaussian statistics of magnetization transfer in the easy-axis regime is found to converge towards the universal distribution of charged single-file systems. At the isotropic point we infer a weakly non-Gaussian distribution, corroborating the view that superdiffusive spin transport in integrable spin chains does not belong to any known dynamical universality class.",

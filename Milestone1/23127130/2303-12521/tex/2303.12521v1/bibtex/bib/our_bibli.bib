	Abstract = {This article is a perspective on the recently discovered realm of submesoscale currents in the ocean. They are intermediate-scale flow structures in the form of density fronts and filaments, topographic wakes and persistent coherent vortices at the surface and throughout the interior. They are created from mesoscale eddies and strong currents, and they provide a dynamical conduit for energy transfer towards microscale dissipation and diapycnal mixing. Consideration is given to their generation mechanisms, instabilities, life cycles, disruption of approximately diagnostic force balance (e.g. geostrophy), turbulent cascades, internal-wave interactions, and transport and dispersion of materials. At a fundamental level, more questions remain than answers, implicating a programme for further research.},

abstract = {High-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) estimates are dependent on satellite-based infrared radiometers, which are proven to be highly accurate in the past decades. However, the presence of clouds is a big stumbling block when physical approaches are used to derive SST. This problem is more prominent across tropical regions such as Arabian Sea(AS) and Bay of Bengal(BoB), restricting the availability of high-resolution SST data for ocean applications. The previous studies for developing daily high-resolution cloud-free SST products mainly focus on fusion of multiple satellites and in-situ data products that are computationally expensive and often time consuming. At the same time, it was observed that the capabilities of data-driven approaches are not yet fully explored in the estimation of cloud-free high-resolution SST data. Hence, in this study an attempt has been made for the first time to estimate daily cloud free SST from a single sensor (MODIS Aqua) dataset using advanced machine learning techniques. Here, three distinct machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF)-based algorithms were developed and evaluated over two different study areas within the AS and BoB using 10 years of MODIS data and in-situ reference data. Among the developed algorithms, the SVR-based algorithm performs consistently better. In AS region, while testing, the SVR-based SST estimates was able to achieve an adjusted coefficient of determination (Radj2) of 0.82 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.71 °C with respect to the in situ data. Similarly, in BoB too, the SVR algorithm outperforms the other algorithms with Radj2 of 0.78 with RMSE of 0.88 °C. Further, a spatio-temporal and visual analysis of the results as well as an inter-comparision with NOAA AVHRR daily optimally interpolated global SST (a standard SST product available in practice) the suggest that the proposed SVR-based algorithm has huge potential to produce operational high-resolution cloud-free SST estimates, even if there is cloud cover in the image.}

ABSTRACT = {The sea surface temperature (SST) is an important parameter of the energy balance on the Earth&rsquo;s surface. SST prediction is crucial to marine production, marine protection, and climate prediction. However, the current SST prediction model still has low precision and poor stability. In this study, a medium and long-term SST prediction model is designed on the basis of the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network algorithm. This model captures the SST time regularity by using the GRU layer and outputs the predicted results through the fully connected layer. The Bohai Sea, which is characterized by a large annual temperature difference, is selected as the study area, and the SSTs on different time scales (monthly and quarterly) are used to verify the practicability and stability of the model. The results show that the designed SST prediction model can efficiently fit the results of the real sea surface temperature, and the correlation coefficient is above 0.98. Regardless of whether monthly or quarterly data are used, the proposed network model performs better than long short-term memory in terms of stability and accuracy when the length of the prediction increases. The root mean square error and mean absolute error of the predicted SST are mostly within 0&ndash;2.5 &deg;C.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning techniques are attractive tools to establish statistical models with a high degree of non linearity. They require a large amount of data to be trained and are therefore particularly suited to analysing remote sensing data. This work is an attempt at using advanced statistical methods of machine learning to predict the bias between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) derived from infrared remote sensing and ground “truth” from drifting buoy measurements. A large dataset of collocation between satellite SST and in situ SST is explored. Four regression models are used: Simple multi-linear regression, Least Square Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and random forest. In the case of geostationary satellites for which a large number of collocations is available, results show that the random forest model is the best model to predict the systematic errors and it is computationally fast, making it a good candidate for operational processing. It is able to explain nearly 31% of the total variance of the bias (in comparison to about 24% for the multi-linear regression model).},

ABSTRACT = {We performed an out-of-distribution (OOD) analysis of ∼12,000,000 semi-independent 128 × 128 pixel2 sea surface temperature (SST) regions, which we define as cutouts, from all nighttime granules in the MODIS R2019 Level-2 public dataset to discover the most complex or extreme phenomena at the ocean’s surface. Our algorithm (ULMO) is a probabilistic autoencoder (PAE), which combines two deep learning modules: (1) an autoencoder, trained on ∼150,000 random cutouts from 2010, to represent any input cutout with a 512-dimensional latent vector akin to a (non-linear) Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis; and (2) a normalizing flow, which maps the autoencoder’s latent space distribution onto an isotropic Gaussian manifold. From the latter, we calculated a log-likelihood (LL) value for each cutout and defined outlier cutouts to be those in the lowest 0.1% of the distribution. These exhibit large gradients and patterns characteristic of a highly dynamic ocean surface, and many are located within larger complexes whose unique dynamics warrant future analysis. Without guidance, ULMO consistently locates the outliers where the major western boundary currents separate from the continental margin. Prompted by these results, we began the process of exploring the fundamental patterns learned by ULMO thereby identifying several compelling examples. Future work may find that algorithms such as ULMO hold significant potential/promise to learn and derive other, not-yet-identified behaviors in the ocean from the many archives of satellite-derived SST fields. We see no impediment to applying them to other large remote-sensing datasets for ocean science (e.g., SSH and ocean color).},

 principally driven by the wind and shows a significant correlation with the tim

ion and upwelling at the shelfbreak region are modulated by the variability of t
he Malvinas Current transport at low frequency (periods higher than two years), 
and by the local wind stress at higher frequencies. North of 40°S, the local win
d forcing drives the seasonal variations of the shelf transport. The inter-annua
l variability of the flow is driven by the combined action of the Rio de la Plat
a discharge (significantly correlated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation), lo
cal wind stress and the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence in the outer shelf. In agreem
ent with previous studies, we show that while the position of the confluence mar
ks the location of the largest offshelf transports, it does not determine their 
magnitude. The offshelf transport variability is controlled by the local wind at
 high frequency (periods less than a year) and by the equatorward inflow of sout

the Subtropical Shelf Front is modulated by the local wind stress forcing, posit

abstract = {During the 1950s and 1960s, an extensive field study and interpretiv
e effort was made by researchers, primarily at the Scripps Institution of Oceano
graphy, to sample and understand the physical oceanography of the eastern tropic
al Pacific. That work was inspired by the valuable fisheries of the region, the 
recent discovery of the equatorial undercurrent, and the growing realization of 
the importance of the El Niño phenomenon. Here we review what was learned in tha
t effort, and integrate those findings with work published since then as well as
 additional diagnoses based on modern data sets. Unlike the central Pacific, whe
re the winds are nearly zonal and the ocean properties and circulation are nearl
y independent of longitude, the eastern tropical Pacific is distinguished by win
d forcing that is strongly influenced by the topography of the American continen
t. Its circulation is characterized by short zonal scales, permanent eddies and 
significant off-equatorial upwelling. Notably, the Costa Rica Dome and a thermoc
line bowl to its northwest are due to winds blowing through gaps in the Central 
American cordillera, which imprint their signatures on the ocean through linear 
Sverdrup dynamics. Strong annual modulation of the gap winds and the meridional 
oscillation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone generates a Rossby wave, super
imposed on the direct forcing, that results in a southwestward-propagating annua
l thermocline signal accounting for major features of observed thermocline depth
 variations, including that of the Costa Rica Dome, the Tehuantepec bowl, and th
e ridge–trough system of the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). Interannual
 variability of sea surface temperature (SST) and altimetric sea surface height 
signals suggests that the strengthening of the NECC observed in the central Paci
fic during El Niño events continues all the way to the coast, warming SST (by zo
nal advection) in a wider meridional band than the equatorially trapped thermocl
ine anomalies, and pumping equatorial water poleward along the coast. The South 
Equatorial Current originates as a combination of equatorial upwelling, mixing a
nd advection from the NECC, and Peru coastal upwelling, but its sources and thei
r variability remain unresolved. Similarly, while much of the Equatorial Undercu
rrent flows southeast into the Peru Undercurrent and supplies the coastal upwell
ing, a quantitative assessment is lacking. We are still unable to put together t
he eastern interconnections among the long zonal currents of the central Pacific

cal Pacific, first revealed by satellite infrared imagery, play an important rol
e in the dynamics and biology of the region, and in the transfer of mass, energy
, heat, and biological constituents from the shelf to the deep ocean and across 
the equatorial currents. From boreal late autumn to early spring, four to 18 cyc
lonic or anticyclonic eddies are formed off the coastal region between southern 
Mexico and Panama. The anticyclonic gyres, which tend to be larger and last long
er than the cyclonic ones, are the best studied: they typically are ∼180–500km i
n diameter, depress the pycnocline from ∼60 to 145m at the eddy center, have swi
rl speeds in excess of 1ms−1, migrate west at velocities ranging from 11 to 19cm
s−1 (with a slight southward component), and maintain a height signature of up t
o 30cm. The primary generating agents for these eddies are the strong, intermitt
ent wind jets that blow across the isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico, the lake di
strict in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and the Panama canal. Other proposed eddy-ge
nerating mechanisms are the conservation of vorticity as the North Equatorial Co
unter Current (NECC) turns north on reaching America, and the instability of coa
stally trapped waves/currents. Tropical Instability Waves (TIWs) are perturbatio
ns in the SST fronts on either side of the equatorial cold tongue. They produce 
SST variations on the order of 1–2°C, have periods of 20–40 days, wavelengths of
 1000–2000km, phase speeds of around 0.5ms−1 and propagate westward both north a
nd south of the Equator. The Tropical Instability Vortices (TIVs) are a train of
 westward-propagating anticyclonic eddies associated with the TIWs. They exhibit
 eddy currents exceeding 1.3ms−1, a westward phase propagation speed between 30 
and 40kmd−1, a signature above the pycnocline, and eastward energy propagation. 
Like the TIWs, they result from the latitudinal barotropically unstable shear be
tween the South Equatorial Current (SEC) and the NECC with a potential secondary
 source of energy from baroclinic instability of the vertical shear with the Equ
atorial Undercurrent (EUC). This review of mesoscale processes is part of a comp
rehensive review of the oceanography of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.}

 25.8 kg/m3 and 4 Sv between σθ = 25.8 and 27.1 kg/m3. The oxygen minimum in the
 shadow zone comprises the central water and the Antarctic Intermediate Water (A
AIW) layers and is located between the equatorial current system and the North E
quatorial Current. The North Equatorial Counter- and Undercurrents at 3° to 6°N 
are major oxygen sources for the central water layer of the low-oxygen regions i
n the northeastern tropical Atlantic. A second, northern North Equatorial Counte
rcurrent (nNECC) band exists at 8° to 10°N. The nNECC carries oxygen rich water 
from the southern hemisphere eastward but with an admixture of water from the no
rthern hemisphere. A float at 200 m depth was spreading eastward in the North Eq
uatorial Undercurrent (NEUC), at 28°W it shifted northward into the nNECC, and t
hen was trapped in the Guinea Dome region for more than 3 years. The model indic
ates the region 22° to 32°W as the area of exchange between the NECC/NEUC and th
e nNECC bands. In the AAIW layer the northern Intermediate Countercurrent acts a
s oxygen source for the oxygen minimum zone.},

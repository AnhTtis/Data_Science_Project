\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}

We use the continuous coordinate representation for efficient high-resolution image inpainting. To this end, we propose CoordFill, a novel framework that contains the parameter generation network and the pixel-wise querying network following the meta-learning strategy. In detail, in the parameter generation network, we design a novel attention network based on FFC to produce the parameters in a spatial-adaptive fashion. In the pixel-wise querying network, we use the generated parameters from the parameter generation network and query the masked coordinate by re-sampling the coordinates in the frequency domain. The experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method on several datasets compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

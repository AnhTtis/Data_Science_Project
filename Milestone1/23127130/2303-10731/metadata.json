    "abstract": "A non-linear dispersion can significantly impact the Kondo problem, resulting in anomalous effects on electronic transport. By analyzing a special bath with a $θ=\\fracπ{3}$ symmetry rotation in the Brillouin zone or 3-fold symmetry in momentum, we derive an effective spin-spin interacting model. Combining the anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction with non-linear dispersion can lead to exceptional points $(E_p)$ in a Hermitian model. Our RG analysis reveals that the spin relaxation time has the signature of coalescence in momentum-resolved couplings and an ideal logarithmic divergence in resistivity over a range of nonlinearity ($β$). The effective model at the impurity subspace has a Lie group structure of Dirac matrices. We show nontrivial renormalization within a Poorman approximation with the inclusion of potential scattering, and the invariant obtained will not be altered by potential scattering. We expand the model to a two-impurity Kondo model and investigate the Kondo destruction and anomalous spin transport signature by calculating the spin-relaxation time ($τ$).Analysis of RG equations zeros and poles show a \"Sign Reversion\" regime exists for a Hermitian problem with a critical value of nonlinear coupling $J_{k^3}$. Our results show the existence of an out-of-phase RKKY oscillation above and below the critical value of the chemical potential.",

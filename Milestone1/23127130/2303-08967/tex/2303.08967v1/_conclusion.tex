\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A novel two-stage multi-channel speech enhancement method is proposed which combines the robustness and computational simplicity of signal-independent beamforming with the performance of adaptive beamforming. The system proposes a Hybrid beamformer which performs multiple \ac{MVDR} beamformers with different noise field models including isotropic and a variety of anisotropic distributions. The outputs from an Iso and optimal Hybrid beamformers are then jointly used to remove the musical noise via multi-channel \ac{PCA} denoising. The evaluation results, using real-recording `cocktail-party' scenario with head-worn microphone array, demonstrate the benefit of the proposed method in term of improved noise suppression and speech intelligibility with similar speech quality metric, compared to the baseline static and adaptive beamformers.

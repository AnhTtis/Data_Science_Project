    "abstract": "CSV is a widely used format for data representing systems control, information exchange and processing, logging, etc. Nevertheless, the format is riddled with tricky corner cases and inconsistencies, which can make input data unreliable, thus, rendering modelling or simulation experiments unusable or unsafe. We address this problem by providing a SAFE-CSV VDM-library that is: Simple, Accurate, Fast, and Effective. It extends an ecosystem of other VDM mathematical toolkit extensions, which also includes a translation and proof environment for VDM in Isabelle",

To assess the improvements in reliability provided by CBF, we consider the rightmost scenario in Fig.~\ref{fig:WiFi8Features}. Two APs, each with four antennas and a single associated STA equipped with two antennas, implement MLO on two 160\,MHz shared links in the 6\,GHz band. Each AP transmits two spatial streams to their respective STAs. The two APs also employ CBF and use their two remaining spatial degrees of freedom to create radiation nulls towards the other BSS, creating spatial reuse opportunities and avoiding contending for the medium. 

As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:MLO+CBF}, employing MLO with CBF (bottom) creates additional reuse opportunities and reduces the delay when compared to standalone MLO (top). However, placing imperfect nulls also entails a potentially longer transmission time due to an increased OBSS interference and an MCS reduction. We therefore evaluate the effect of an increasing accuracy in the null placement in Fig.~\ref{fig:ThroughputAndDelay}, for which the full set of simulation parameters is reported in Table~\ref{table:parameters}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:ThroughputAndDelay} presents the median, 99\%-tile, and 99.9999\%-tile delay values obtained by combining MLO with CBF as the interference suppression accuracy increases from 10 to 30\,dB. For comparison, the corresponding performance with standalone MLO is also displayed. The results show that when nodes contend for the medium with standalone MLO, the 99.9999\% delay exceeds 100\,ms. 
Such performance worsens when combining MLO with CBF with a null accuracy of just 10\,dB, since the benefits of a higher spatial reuse are outweighed by the resulting increased interference and degraded MCS (down to 16-QAM 3/4). However, the trend is reversed when the null accuracy increases to 20\,dB and above, as the reduction in MCS incurred is more than compensated for by a lack of contention. An accuracy of 30\,dB or more allows for the highest MCS (4096-QAM 5/6) and nearly an order of magnitude reduction in the 99.9999\%-tile delay.

Fig.~\ref{fig:ThroughputAndDelay} shows that even with the latest Wi-Fi\,7 features such as 4096-QAM and MLO, meeting low delay requirements with ultra-high reliability can be challenging in highly dense scenarios where all links are occupied. The primary source of randomness in Wi-Fi networks is contention, and CBF can address this issue and help Wi-Fi\,8 support simultaneous transmissions and achieve near-deterministic operation.

\section{New Use Cases, Standardization, and Spectrum Allocation} \label{sec:updateWiFi}

As Wi-Fi keeps evolving, new use cases and applications are emerging that require not only more throughput and less delay, as targeted by Wi-Fi\,7, but also a higher reliability. Wi-Fi\,8 is poised to meet this demand and unlock new opportunities for innovation. In this section, we explore some of the emerging use cases for Wi-Fi\,8, as well as the standardization and regulatory activities that are shaping its development.

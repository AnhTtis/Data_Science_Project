\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we discussed why and how the Wi-Fi community is betting on ultra high reliability with 802.11bn. We began by reviewing the technical features of state-of-the-art Wi-Fi\,7 and outlined upcoming use cases while sharing updates on standardization, certification, and spectrum regulation. We then explored the disruptive innovations that Wi-Fi\,8 is likely to bring to meet new requirements that have previously been out of reach in the unlicensed spectrum. Finally, we presented a novel system-level study demonstrating how Wi-Fi\,8 could achieve ultra high reliability through a joint interworking of multi-link operation and spatial-domain AP coordination.

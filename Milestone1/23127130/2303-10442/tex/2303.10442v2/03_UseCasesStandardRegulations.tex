\section{New Use Cases, Standardization, and Spectrum Allocation} \label{sec:updateWiFi}

As Wi-Fi keeps evolving, new use cases and applications are emerging that require not only more throughput and less delay, as targeted by Wi-Fi\,7, but also a higher reliability. 
%Wi-Fi\,8 is poised to meet this demand and unlock new opportunities for innovation. 
In this section, we explore some of the emerging use cases for Wi-Fi\,8, as well as the standardization and regulatory activities that are shaping its development.

%\textcolor{blue}{It is worth to mention the work done by the IEEE 802.11 Real Time Applications (RTA) Topic Ingerest Group (TIG), that ---back in 2019--- provided a set of recommendations and guidelines to support low-latency and reliability in future Wi-Fi networks \cite{RTA}. Those recommendations have been considered in the Wi-Fi 7 development (e.g., MLO), but they are also influencing the design of Wi-Fi 8 push towards reliability (e.g., TSN integration).}

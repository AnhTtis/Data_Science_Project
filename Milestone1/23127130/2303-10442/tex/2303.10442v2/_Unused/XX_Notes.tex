%\subsection*{Boris}
%[Boris] We should check what is the Wi-Fi alliance proposing... beyond IEEE 802.11 groups. They are working on a XR profile, for instance.

%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Multi-AP cooperation (over the air)
    %
%    \item Enhanced Multi-link Operation
    %
%    \item Profiles for XR and immersive communication, including the internet of senses.
    %
%    \item Machine Learning? Digital BSS twin?
    %
%    \item Multi-band integration (mmW)
%\end{enumerate}

%OPTION 1

%Latency performance: (i) MLO alone vs MLO + CBF. Sparse vs. dense scenario.

%Latency. Reliability. Add fast fading? [Google Stadia traffic] Multi-user MIMO?

%[1 Table with system parameters]

%[1 Figure with Latency performance]

%OPTION 2 [Lore]

%Highlight the expected shortcomings of Wi-Fi 7, in particular of MLO, with results (possible with current simulator and with reduced effort, it is just a matter of defining the most challenging scenarios for MLO). 

%Then, highlight possible strategies to overcome the expected shortcomings of Wi-Fi 7, especially focusing on latency and reliability.

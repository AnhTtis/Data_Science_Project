What will Wi-Fi 8 be? 
Driven by the strict requirements of emerging applications, next-generation Wi-Fi is set to prioritize Ultra High Reliability (UHR) above all. 
In this paper, we explore the journey towards IEEE 802.11bn UHR, the amendment that will form the basis of Wi-Fi\,8. 
%[Lorenzo: \footnote{At the time of writing, 802.11bn is the name most likely to be adopted for the new Wi-Fi amendment. This will be confirmed prior to final publication.}]
%After providing an overview of the nearly completed Wi-Fi\,7 standard, 
We first present new use cases calling for further Wi-Fi evolution and also outline current standardization, certification, and spectrum allocation activities, sharing updates from the newly formed UHR Study Group.
We then introduce the disruptive new features envisioned for Wi-Fi\,8 %802.11bn
and discuss the associated research challenges. Among those, we focus on access point coordination and demonstrate that it could build upon 802.11be multi-link operation to make Ultra High Reliability a reality in Wi-Fi\,8.

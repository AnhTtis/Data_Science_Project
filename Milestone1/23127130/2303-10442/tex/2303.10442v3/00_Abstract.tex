What will Wi-Fi 8 be? 
Driven by the strict requirements of emerging applications, next-generation Wi-Fi is set to prioritize Ultra High Reliability (UHR) above all. 
In this paper, we explore the journey towards IEEE 802.11bn UHR, the amendment that will form the basis of Wi-Fi\,8. 
We first present new use cases calling for further Wi-Fi evolution and \blue{associated standardization, certification, and spectrum allocation efforts.}
We then introduce \blue{a selection of the main disruptive features envisioned for Wi-Fi\,8 and their associated research challenges, resulting from the outcome of the UHR Study Group.} %802.11bn
%and discuss the associated research challenges. 
Among those, we focus on multi access point coordination and demonstrate that it could build upon 802.11be multi-link operation to make \blue{UHR} a reality in Wi-Fi\,8.

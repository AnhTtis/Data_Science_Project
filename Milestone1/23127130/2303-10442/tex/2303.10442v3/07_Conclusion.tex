\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we discussed why and how the Wi-Fi community is betting on ultra-high reliability with 802.11bn. \blue{We began by outlining the upcoming use cases and} sharing updates on standardization, certification, and spectrum regulation. We then explored the disruptive innovations that Wi-Fi\,8 is likely to bring to meet new requirements previously out of reach in the unlicensed spectrum. We further presented a novel system-level study, demonstrating how Wi-Fi\,8 could achieve ultra-high reliability \blue{through the joint interworking of multi-link operation and spatial-domain multi-AP coordination.}

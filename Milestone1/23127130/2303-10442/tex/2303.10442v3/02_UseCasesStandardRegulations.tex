%\green{\section{New Use Cases, Standardization,\\ and Spectrum Allocation}}
As Wi-Fi keeps evolving, new use cases and applications are emerging that require not only more throughput and less delay, as targeted by Wi-Fi\,7, but also a higher reliability. In this section, we explore some of the emerging use cases for Wi-Fi\,8, as well as the standardization and regulatory activities that are shaping its development.

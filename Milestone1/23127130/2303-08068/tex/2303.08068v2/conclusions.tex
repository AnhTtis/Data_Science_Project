\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we proposed a style feature extracting CVAE conditioned by CL.
The CL models isolate the style features, and the proposed CVAE captures them.
Additionally, we introduced a constraint based on mutual information to aid the CVAE in extracting features that correspond exclusively to styles.
Our experiments used two simple datasets, i.e.,\ MNIST and the Google Fonts dataset, and showed that the proposed method effectively extracts the style features.
Additional experiments on larger, real-world image datasets, i.e.,\ Imagenette and DAISO-100, further demonstrated that the proposed method could effectively deal with larger-scale datasets.

Although the proposed method was successful in extracting style information, there is room for improvement.
The decoder can be improved to better assess the learned style features when using natural image datasets.
One potential approach to achieve this would be to combine the method with GANs~\cite{GAN}.
Another area for improvement would be to extend the method to other domains such as time-series data, for example, audio, speech, and biosignals, which have styles corresponding to subjects and for which CL has been reported to be effective~\cite{Saeed2021,Eldele2021}.

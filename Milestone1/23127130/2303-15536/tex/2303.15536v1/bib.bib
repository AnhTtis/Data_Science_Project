  abstract = {The ubiquity of internet-based nutrition information sharing indicates an opportunity to use social computing platforms to promote nutrition literacy and healthy nutritional choices. We conducted a series of experiments with unpaid volunteers using an online Nutrition Knowledge Test. The test asked participants to examine pairs of photographed meals and identify meals higher in a specific macronutrient (e.g., carbohydrate). After each answer, participants received no feedback on the accuracy of their answers, viewed proportions of peers choosing each response, received correctness feedback from an expert dietitian with or without expert-generated explanations, or received correctness feedback with crowd-generated explanations. The results showed that neither viewing peer responses nor correctness feedback alone improved learning. However, correctness feedback with explanations (i.e., modeling) led to significant learning gains, with no significant difference between explanations generated by experts or peers. This suggests the importance of explanations in social computing-based casual learning about nutrition and the potential for scaling this approach via crowdsourcing.},

@article{hauser09:website,
	Abstract = {Virtual advisors often increase sales for those customers who find such online advice to be convenient and helpful. However, other customers take a more active role in their purchase decisions and prefer more detailed data. In general, we expect that websites are more preferred and increase sales if their characteristics (e.g., more detailed data) match customers' cognitive styles (e.g., more analytic). ``Morphing'' involves automatically matching the basic ``look and feel'' of a website, not just the content, to cognitive styles. We infer cognitive styles from clickstream data with Bayesian updating. We then balance exploration (learning how morphing affects purchase probabilities) with exploitation (maximizing short-term sales) by solving a dynamic program (partially observable Markov decision process). The solution is made feasible in real time with expected Gittins indices. We apply the Bayesian updating and dynamic programming to an experimental BT Group (formerly British Telecom) website using data from 835 priming respondents. If we had perfect information on cognitive styles, the optimal ``morph'' assignments would increase purchase intentions by 21{\%}. When cognitive styles are partially observable, dynamic programming does almost as well---purchase intentions can increase by almost 20{\%}. If implemented system-wide, such increases represent approximately {\$}80 million in additional revenue.},

To do so, we need to identify individual cognitive tind personality characteristics, validate them and discover appropriate design solutions to deal with such differences. These factors are long-term and relatively stable individual aptitudes and therefore arc difficult for humans to change. We believe that it is exactly these sort of differences with which adaptive systems should conccm themselves. We describe how we have approached identification of these characteristics and dcscribc how they were incorporated in an operational, though functionally quite simple system.},

@article{assor02:choice,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This article examines two questions concerning teacher-behaviours that are characterised in Self-Determination Theory (Ryan {\&} Deci, 2000) as autonomy-supportive or suppressive: (1) Can children differentiate among various types of autonomy-enhancing and suppressing teacher behaviours? (2) Which of those types of behaviour are particularly important in predicting feelings toward and engagement in schoolwork? It was hypothesised that teacher behaviours that help students to understand the relevance of schoolwork for their personal interests and goals are particularly important predictors of engagement in schoolwork. SAMPLES AND METHODS: Israeli students in grades 3-5 (N = 498) and in grades 6-8 (N = 364) completed questionnaires assessing the variables of interest. RESULTS: Smallest Space Analyses indicated that both children and early adolescents can differentiate among three types of autonomy enhancing teacher behaviours - fostering relevance, allowing criticism, and providing choice - and three types of autonomy suppressing teacher behaviours - suppressing criticism, intruding, and forcing unmeaningful acts. Regression analyses supported the hypothesis concerning the importance of teacher behaviours that clarify the personal relevance of schoolwork. Among the autonomy-suppressing behaviours, 'Criticism-suppression' was the best predictor of feelings and engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the active and empathic nature of teachers' role in supporting students' autonomy, and suggest that autonomy-support is important not only for early adolescents but also for children. Discussion of potential determinants of the relative importance of various autonomy-affecting teacher actions suggests that provision of choice should not always be viewed as a major indicator of autonomy support.},

@article{weinberg14:comparing,
	Abstract = {Compared to older kinds of sample surveys, online platforms provide a fast and low-cost platform for factorial surveys, as well as a more demographically diverse alternative to student samples. Two distinct strategies have emerged for recruitment: using panels based on population-based samples versus recruiting people actively seeking to complete online tasks for money. The latter is much cheaper but prompts various concerns about data quality and generalizability. We compare results of three vignette experiments conducted using the leading online panel that uses a population-based paradigm (Knowledge Networks, now GfK) and the leading platform for crowdsource recruitment (Amazon Mechanical Turk). Our data show that, while demographic differences exist, most notably in age, the actual results of our experiments are very similar, especially once these demographic differences have been taken into account. Indicators of data quality were actually slightly better among the crowdsource subjects. Although more evidence is plainly needed, our results support the accumulating evidence for the promise of crowdsource recruitment for online experiments, including factorial surveys.},

We review weighting adjustment methods for panel attrition and suggest approaches for incorporating design variables, such as strata, clusters, and baseline sample weights. Design information can typically be included in attrition analysis using multilevel models or decision tree methods such as the chi-square automatic interaction detection algorithm. We use simulation to show that these weighting approaches can effectively reduce bias in the survey estimates that would occur from omitting the effect of design factors on attrition while keeping the resulted weights stable. We provide a step-by-step illustration on creating weighting adjustments for panel attrition in the Galveston Bay Recovery Study, a survey of residents in a community following a disaster, and provide suggestions to analysts in decision-making about weighting approaches.},

@article{wang14:forecasting,
	Abstract = {Election forecasts have traditionally been based on representative polls, in which randomly sampled individuals are asked who they intend to vote for. While representative polling has historically proven to be quite effective, it comes at considerable costs of time and money. Moreover, as response rates have declined over the past several decades, the statistical benefits of representative sampling have diminished. In this paper, we show that, with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and that this can often be achieved faster and at a lesser expense than traditional survey methods. We demonstrate this approach by creating forecasts from a novel and highly non-representative survey dataset: a series of daily voter intention polls for the 2012 presidential election conducted on the Xbox gaming platform. After adjusting the Xbox responses via multilevel regression and poststratification, we obtain estimates which are in line with the forecasts from leading poll analysts, which were based on aggregating hundreds of traditional polls conducted during the election cycle. We conclude by arguing that non-representative polling shows promise not only for election forecasting, but also for measuring public opinion on a broad range of social, economic and cultural issues.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel platform for supporting public deliberation on difficult decisions. ConsiderIt guides people to reflect on tradeoffs and the perspectives of others by framing interactions around pro/con points that participants create, adopt, and share. ConsiderIt surfaces the most salient pros and cons overall, while also enabling users to drill down into the key points for different groups. We deployed ConsiderIt in a contentious U.S. state election, inviting residents to deliberate on nine ballot measures. We discuss ConsiderIt's affordances and limitations, enriched with empirical data from this deployment. We show that users often engaged in normatively desirable activities, such as crafting positions that recognize both pros and cons, as well as points written by people who do not agree with them.},

	Abstract = {Prior work on creativity support tools demonstrates how a computational semantic model of a solution space can enable interventions that substantially improve the number, quality and diversity of ideas. However, automated semantic modeling often falls short when people contribute short text snippets or sketches. Innovation platforms can employ humans to provide semantic judgments to construct a semantic model, but this relies on external workers completing a large number of tedious micro tasks. This requirement threatens both accuracy (external workers may lack expertise and context to make accurate semantic judgments) and scalability (external workers are costly). In this paper, we introduce IdeaHound, an ideation system that seamlessly integrates the task of defining semantic relationships among ideas into the primary task of idea generation. The system combines implicit human actions with machine learning to create a computational semantic model of the emerging solution space. The integrated nature of these judgments allows IdeaHound to leverage the expertise and efforts of participants who are already motivated to contribute to idea generation, overcoming the issues of scalability inherent to existing approaches. Our results show that participants were equally willing to use (and just as productive using) IdeaHound compared to a conventional platform that did not require organizing ideas. Our integrated crowdsourcing approach also creates a more accurate semantic model than an existing crowdsourced approach (performed by external crowds). We demonstrate how this model enables helpful creative interventions: providing diverse inspirational examples, providing similar ideas for a given idea and providing a visual overview of the solution space.},

Split Adaptive Interfaces, where a limited part of the screen contains copies of the interface elements predicted to be of immediate use, are one technique for resolving this difficulty. While prior work demonstrated that Split Adaptive Interfaces improve performance on average, the results of our study demonstrate systematic individual differences in the utilization of the adaptive features, which correlate with the stable user traits of Need for Cognition and Extraversion. Specifically, higher Need for Cognition (a willingness to undertake difficult mental activities) is correlated with increased utilization rates, while higher Extraversion (a general orientation towards seeking gratification from the external world) is negatively correlated with utilization rates. Our results also demonstrate a significant negative correlation between cognitive load induced by a secondary task and the utilization of the adaptive features. This effect, however, is very small (less than two percentage points). Together, these results provide additional evidence of the usefulness of the split adaptive interface approach and a negligible effect of additional cognitive load, but also demonstrate that the approach does not benefit all users equally.},

However, crowdsourcing is not yet widely adopted by researchers for generating, processing or analyzing research data. This study develops a deeper understanding of the circumstances under which crowdsourcing is a useful, feasible or desirable tool for research, as well as the factors that may influence researchers' decisions around adopting crowdsourcing technology. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 researchers in diverse disciplines, spanning the humanities and sciences, to illuminate how research norms and practitioners' dispositions were related to uncertainties around research processes, data, knowledge, delegation and quality. The paper concludes with a discussion of the design implications for future crowdsourcing systems to support research.},

Internet data collection methods, with a focus on self-report questionnaires from self-selected samples, are evaluated and compared with traditional paper-and-pencil methods. Six preconceptions about Internet samples and data quality are evaluated by comparing a new large Internet sample (N = 361,703) with a set of 510 published traditional samples. Internet samples are shown to be relatively diverse with respect to gender, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and age. Moreover, Internet findings generalize across presentation formats, are not adversely affected by nonserious or repeat responders, and are consistent with findings from traditional methods. It is concluded that Internet methods can contribute to many areas of psychology.},

@article{cacioppo82:need,
	Abstract = {Developed and validated the Need for Cognition Scale (NCS). In Study 1, a pool of items was administered to 96 faculty members (high-need-for-cognition group) and assembly line workers (low-need-for-cognition group). Ambiguity, irrelevance, and internal consistency were used to select items for subsequent studies. Factor analysis yielded one major factor. In Study 2, the NCS and the Group Embedded Figures Test were administered to 419 undergraduates to validate the factor structure and to determine whether the NCS tapped a construct distinct from test anxiety and cognitive style. The factor structure was replicated, and responses to the NCS were weakly related to cognitive style and unrelated to test anxiety. In Study 3, 104 undergraduates completed the NCS, the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and a dogmatism scale. Results indicate that need for cognition was related weakly and negatively to being closeminded, unrelated to social desirability, and positively correlated with general intelligence. Study 4 (97 undergraduates) furnished evidence of the predictive validity of the NCS. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{engel14:reading,
	Abstract = {Recent research with face-to-face groups found that a measure of general group effectiveness (called "collective intelligence") predicted a group's performance on a wide range of different tasks. The same research also found that collective intelligence was correlated with the individual group members' ability to reason about the mental states of others (an ability called "Theory of Mind" or "ToM"). Since ToM was measured in this work by a test that requires participants to "read" the mental states of others from looking at their eyes (the "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" test), it is uncertain whether the same results would emerge in online groups where these visual cues are not available. Here we find that: (1) a collective intelligence factor characterizes group performance approximately as well for online groups as for face-to-face groups; and (2) surprisingly, the ToM measure is equally predictive of collective intelligence in both face-to-face and online groups, even though the online groups communicate only via text and never see each other at all. This provides strong evidence that ToM abilities are just as important to group performance in online environments with limited nonverbal cues as they are face-to-face. It also suggests that the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test measures a deeper, domain-independent aspect of social reasoning, not merely the ability to recognize facial expressions of mental states.},

	Abstract = {Children with complex health conditions require care from a large, diverse team of caregivers that includes multiple types of medical professionals, parents and community support organizations. Coordination of their outpatient care, essential for good outcomes, presents major challenges. Extensive healthcare research has shown that the use of integrated, team-based care plans improves care coordination, but such plans are rarely deployed in practice. This paper reports on a study of care teams treating children with complex conditions at a major university tertiary care center. This study investigated barriers to plan implementation and resultant care coordination problems. It revealed the complex nature of teamwork in complex care, which poses challenges to team coordination that extend beyond those identified in prior work and handled by existing coordination systems. The paper builds on a computational teamwork theory to identify opportunities for technology to support increased plan-based complex-care coordination and to propose design approaches for systems that enable and enhance such coordination.},

	Abstract = {Long documents are abundant on the web today, and are accessed in increasing numbers from touchscreen devices such as mobile phones and tablets. Navigating long documents with small screens can be challenging both physically and cognitively because they compel the user to scroll a great deal and to mentally filter for important content. To support navigation of long documents on touchscreen devices, we introduce content-aware kinetic scrolling, a novel scrolling technique that dynamically applies pseudo-haptic feedback in the form of friction around points of high interest within the page. This allows users to quickly find interesting content while exploring without further cluttering the limited visual space. To model degrees of interest (DOI) for a variety of existing web pages, we introduce social wear, a method for capturing DOI based on social signals that indicate collective user interest. Our preliminary evaluation shows that users pay attention to items with kinetic scrolling feedback during search, recognition, and skimming tasks.},

In this paper, we report the results of a mixed-methods algorithm audit of partisan audience bias and personalization within Google Search. Following Donald Trump's inauguration, we recruited 187 participants to complete a survey and install a browser extension that enabled us to collect Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) from their computers. To quantify partisan audience bias, we developed a domain-level score by leveraging the sharing propensities of registered voters on a large Twitter panel. We found little evidence for the "filter bubble'' hypothesis. Instead, we found that results positioned toward the bottom of Google SERPs were more left-leaning than results positioned toward the top, and that the direction and magnitude of overall lean varied by search query, component type (e.g. "answer boxes"), and other factors. Utilizing rank-weighted metrics that we adapted from prior work, we also found that Google's rankings shifted the average lean of SERPs to the right of their unweighted average.},

In one form of co-design, Cooperative Inquiry, children and adults design together in a lab environment. Unfortunately, children who live in non-affluent areas may have trouble participating in groups like this because they are unable to attend design sessions due to a combination of lack of transit options or parental involvement.This paper reflects on four years of co-design in an American, economically depressed city with the sole purpose of trying to include more voices in the design process. Working within and then beyond Cooperative Inquiry, the authors discuss the city's history of racial segregation and classism and how researchers can be more equitable and equal in their construction of co-design teams in urban environments. Shorter, more focused design sessions in locations easily accessible by children are the key to more inclusive co-design.},

There have been calls to require some speculation about negative impacts as part of the peer review process. This workshop will explore how to think about and report potential negative consequences in our papers in a way that’s practical, inclusive, and achievable. The aim is to draw on scholarship around creative-yet-grounded speculation about technology futures and to consider how these might be applied to publication and peer review.

This exploration is exemplified by a case study in the field of well-being, which presents the key elements of NSP problem solving in PD. The nature of PD such as democratic participation, empowerment, and respect for field sites can make the NSP search more effective and enriching, and the results of participatory NSP problem solving have the potential to integrate activities of participant groups in different contexts and reconfigure them as an ecosystem that makes them contribute to each other.},

Developing technology that is universally useful and engaging requires knowledge about members of WEIRD and non-WEIRD societies alike. In other words, it requires us, the CHI community, to generate this knowledge by studying representative participant samples. To find out to what extent CHI participant samples are from Western societies, we analyzed papers published in the CHI proceedings between 2016-2020. Our findings show that 73% of CHI study findings are based on Western participant samples, representing less than 12% of the world’s population. Furthermore, we show that most participant samples at CHI tend to come from industrialized, rich, and democratic countries with generally highly educated populations. Encouragingly, recent years have seen a slight increase in non-Western samples and those that include several countries. We discuss suggestions for further broadening the international representation of CHI participant samples.},

@inproceedings{flatla13:sprweb,
	Abstract = {Colours are an important part of user experiences on the Web. Colour schemes influence the aesthetics, first impressions and long-term engagement with websites. However, five percent of people perceive a subset of all colours because they have colour vision deficiency (CVD), resulting in an unequal and less-rich user experience on the Web. Traditionally, people with CVD have been supported by recolouring tools that improve colour differentiability, but do not consider the subjective properties of colour schemes while recolouring. To address this, we developed SPRWeb, a tool that recolours websites to preserve subjective responses and improve colour differentiability - thus enabling users with CVD to have similar online experiences. To develop SPRWeb, we extended existing models of non-CVD subjective responses to CVD, then used this extended model to steer the recolouring process. In a lab study, we found that SPRWeb did significantly better than a standard recolouring tool at preserving the temperature and naturalness of websites, while achieving similar weight and differentiability preservation. We also found that recolouring did not preserve activity, and hypothesize that visual complexity influences activity more than colour. SPRWeb is the first tool to automatically preserve the subjective and perceptual properties of website colour schemes thereby equalizing the colour-based web experience for people with CVD.},

	Abstract = {With an unprecedented scale of learners watching educational videos on online platforms such as MOOCs and YouTube, there is an opportunity to incorporate data generated from their interactions into the design of novel video interaction techniques. Interaction data has the potential to help not only instructors to improve their videos, but also to enrich the learning experience of educational video watchers. This paper explores the design space of data-driven interaction techniques for educational video navigation. We introduce a set of techniques that augment existing video interface widgets, including: a 2D video timeline with an embedded visualization of collective navigation traces; dynamic and non-linear timeline scrubbing; data-enhanced transcript search and keyword summary; automatic display of relevant still frames next to the video; and a visual summary representing points with high learner activity. To evaluate the feasibility of the techniques, we ran a laboratory user study with simulated learning tasks. Participants rated watching lecture videos with interaction data to be efficient and useful in completing the tasks. However, no significant differences were found in task performance, suggesting that interaction data may not always align with moment-by-moment information needs during the tasks.},

In organic peer assessment there are no upper or lower limits on the number of assignments each peer has to review, avoiding the common issue of prematurely coercing students into activities they might fear and dislike. Instead, peer assessment occurs as a side effect of activities students find intrinsically motivating. We outline the basic set of functionality required for the implementation of our vision for peer assessment in an online environment and present the results of a preliminary study we conducted in a flipped classroom. We found that the quality of the summative assessment produced by the peers matched that of experts, and we encountered strong evidence that our peer assessment implementation had positive effects on achievement. We conclude with a discussion arguing that organic peer assessment is a valuable technique-distinct from formal peer assessment-for deployment in MOOCs.},

@article{borkin13:evaluation,
	Abstract = {Having effective visualizations of filesystem provenance data is valuable for understanding its complex hierarchical struc- ture. The most common visual representation of provenance data is the node-link diagram. While effective for understanding local activity, the node-link diagram fails to offer a high-level summary of activity and inter-relationships within the data. We present a new tool, InProv, which displays filesystem provenance with an interactive radial-based tree layout. The tool also utilizes a new time-based hierarchical node grouping method for filesystem provenance data we developed to match the user's mental model and make data exploration more intuitive. We compared InProv to a conventional node-link based tool, Orbiter, in a quantitative evaluation with real users of filesystem provenance data including provenance data experts, IT professionals, and computational scientists. We also compared in the evaluation our new node grouping method to a conventional method. The results demonstrate that InProv results in higher accuracy in identifying system activity than Orbiter with large complex data sets. The results also show that our new time- based hierarchical node grouping method improves performance in both tools, and participants found both tools significantly easier to use with the new time-based node grouping method. Subjective measures show that participants found InProv to require less mental activity, less physical activity, less work, and is less stressful to use. Our study also reveals one of the first cases of gender differences in visualization; both genders had comparable performance with InProv, but women had a significantly lower average accuracy (56%) compared to men (70%) with Orbiter.},

@article{gajos12:personalized,
	Abstract = {It is a cliche to point out that computers and the Internet have entered all parts of our lives. We need them at work; governments urge us to file our taxes online; students are required to use them in their classes; online businesses offer better deals than their brick-and-mortar counterparts; and it is becoming more difficult to maintain relationships without access to social networking and social media sites. Public discourse about accessibility focuses on the assertion that access to these technologies is essential for meaningful participation in today's society. Unfortunately, compliance with accessibility guidelines and standards is still not a part of mainstream software engineering and user interface design practice. As
a result, we must remind, beg, and threaten developers to make software accessible. But is this sufficient? Are we blinding ourselves to tomorrow's challenges as we fight yesterday's battles?<br/><br/>
We argue that it is both the possibility and the efficiency of access that are necessary for meaningful and equitable participation in society. As larger fractions of our personal and professional activities are conducted using computers, inefficient access limits what an individual can achieve. We propose a longterm vision of Personalized Dynamic Accessibility: We believe that user interfaces will enable more effective interaction if they reflect each person's unique abilities, devices, and environment.},

	Abstract = {States that both the popular creativity tests, such as the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, and the subjective assessment techniques used in some previous creativity studies are ill-suited to social psychological studies of creativity. A consensual definition of creativity is presented, and as a refinement of previous subjective methods, a reliable subjective assessment technique based on that definition is described. The results of 8 studies testing the methodology in elementary school and undergraduate populations in both artistic and verbal domains are presented, and the advantages and limitations of this technique are discussed. The present methodology can be useful for the development of a social psychology of creativity because of the nature of the tasks employed and the creativity assessments obtained. Creativity assessment is discussed in terms of the divergent aims and methods of personality psychology and social psychology.

	Abstract = {PlateMate allows users to take photos of their meals and receive estimates of food intake and composition. Accurate awareness of this information is considered a prerequisite to successful change of eating habits, but current methods for food logging via self-reporting, expert observation, or algorithmic analysis are time-consuming, expensive, or inaccurate.  PlateMate crowdsources nutritional analysis from photographs using Amazon Mechanical Turk, automatically coordinating untrained workers to estimate a meal's calories, fat, carbohydrates, and protein.  We present the Management framework for crowdsourcing complex tasks, which supports PlateMate's decomposition of the nutrition analysis workflow. Two evaluations show that the PlateMate system is nearly as accurate as a trained dietitian and easier to use for most users than traditional self-reporting, while remaining robust for general use across a wide variety of meal types.},

	Abstract = {When mobile devices are used on the move, a user's limited visual resources are split between interacting with the mobile devices and maintaining awareness of the surrounding environment. In this study, we examined stylus-based tapping operations on a PDA under three mobility situations: seated, walking on a treadmill, and walking through an obstacle course. The results revealed that Fitts' Law continues to be effective even under the most challenging obstacle course condition. While target selection times did not differ between the various mobility conditions, overall task completion times, error rates, and several measures of workload differed significantly. Diminished performance under the obstacle course condition was attributed to increased demands on attention associated with navigating through the obstacle course. Results showed that the participants in the obstacle course condition were able to tap on a 6.4 mm-diameter target with 90% accuracy, but they reduced their walking speed by 36% and perceived an increased workload. Extending earlier research, we found that treadmill-based conditions were able to generate representative data for task selection times, but accuracy differed significantly from the more realistic obstacle course condition.},

Next, we prove the convergence of this algorithm. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of our algorithm with model selection. Finally, we apply our algorithm to a data set collected from a P300-based brain computer interface (BCI) speller. This algorithm is shown to be able to significantly reduce training effort of the P300-based BCI speller.},

	Abstract = {Objective : Visual event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were elicited using a 3-stimulus oddball paradigm to assess the P3a with passive stimulus processing. Methods : Young adults ( n =12) were presented with a series of visual stimuli consisting of a solid circle standard stimulus ( P =0.76) that was difficult to discriminate from a larger target circle ( P =0.12), with a large square distractor stimulus ( P =0.12) presented randomly in the series. Subjects were instructed in the passive condition to simply look at the stimuli and in the active condition to press a mouse key only to the target stimulus. ERPs were recorded from 15 scalp electrodes, with the amplitude and latency of the P300 from the distractor and target stimuli assessed. Results : The P3a from the distractor stimulus was similar in amplitude, scalp topography, and peak latency across the passive and active task conditions. The P3b from the target stimulus demonstrated much smaller amplitude, highly altered scalp topography, and longer latency for the passive compared to active task conditions. Conclusions : The P3a can be obtained with visual stimuli in the 3-stimulus paradigm under passive viewing conditions. Theoretical implications and clinical applications are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has focused on developing a brain-controlled switch named the low frequency asynchronous switch design (LF-ASD) that is suitable for intermittent control of devices such as environmental control systems, computers, and neural prostheses. On-line implementations of the LF-ASD have shown promising results in response to actual index finger flexions with able-bodied subjects. This paper reports the results of initial on-line evaluations of the LF-ASD brain-controlled switch with both able-bodied subjects and subjects with high-level spinal-cord injuries. This paper has demonstrated that users can activate the LF-ASD switch by imaging movement. In this paper, two able-bodied subjects were able to control the LF-ASD with imagined voluntary movements with hit (true positive) rates above 70% and false positive rates below 3% while two subjects with high-level spinal-cord injuries demonstrated hit rates ranging from 45-48% and false positive rates below 1%.},

	Abstract = {Self-initiation, that is the ability of a brain-computer interface (BCI) user to autonomously switch on and off the system, is a very important issue. In this work we analyze whether the respiratory heart rate response, induced by brisk inspiration, can be used as an additional communication channel. After only 20 min of feedback training, ten healthy subjects were able to self-initiate and operate a 4-class steady-state visual evoked potential-based (SSVEP) BCI by using one bipolar ECG and one bipolar EEG channel only. Threshold detection was used to measure a beat-to-beat heart rate increase. Despite this simple method, during a 30 min evaluation period on average only 2.9 non-intentional switches (heart rate changes) were detected.},

@article{bensch07:nessi,
	Abstract = {We have previously demonstrated that an EEG-controlled web browser based on self-regulation of slow cortical potentials (SCPs) enables severely paralyzed patients to browse the internet independently of any voluntary muscle control. However, this system had several shortcomings, among them that patients could only browse within a limited number of web pages and had to select links from an alphabetical list, causing problems if the link names were identical or if they were unknown to the user (as in graphical links). Here we describe a new EEG-controlled web browser, called Nessi, which overcomes these shortcomings. In Nessi, the open source browser, Mozilla, was extended by graphical in-place markers, whereby different brain responses correspond to different frame colors placed around selectable items, enabling the user to select any link on a web page. Besides links, other interactive elements are accessible to the user, such as e-mail and virtual keyboards, opening up a wide range of hypertext-based applications.},

	Abstract = {The empirical and theoretical development of the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) is reviewed by considering factors that contribute to its amplitude, latency, and general characteristics. The neuropsychological origins of the P3a and P3b subcomponents are detailed, and how target/standard discrimination difficulty modulates scalp topography is discussed. The neural loci of P3a and P3b generation are outlined, and a cognitive model is proffered: P3a originates from stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms during task processing, whereas P3b originates from temporal-parietal activity associated with attention and appears related to subsequent memory processing. Neurotransmitter actions associating P3a to frontal/dopaminergic and P3b to parietal/norepinephrine pathways are highlighted. Neuroinhibition is suggested as an overarching theoretical mechanism for P300, which is elicited when stimulus detection engages memory operations.},

@article{Birch:2003p2192,
	Abstract = {The Neil Squire Foundation (NSF) is a Canadian nonprofit organization whose purpose is to create opportunities for independence for individuals who have significant physical disabilities. Over the last ten years, our team in partnership with researchers at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, the University of British Columbia, has been working to develop a direct brain-controlled switch for individuals with significant physical disabilities. The NSF Brain Interface Project primarily focuses on the development of brain-computer interface switch technologies for intermittent (or asynchronous) control in natural environments. That is, technologies that will work when the User intends control but also remains in a stable off state when there is no intent to control. A prototype of such a switch has successfully been developed. This switch has demonstrated classification accuracies greater than 94%. The initial results are promising, but further research is required to improve switch accuracies and reliability and to test these switch technologies over a larger population of users and operating conditions. This paper provides an overview of the NSF brain-switch technologies and details our approach to future work in this area.},

These include integer linear programming (Land-Doig and Balas methods), nonlinear programming (minimization of nonconvex objective functions), the traveling-salesman problem (Eastman and Little, et. al. methods), and the quadratic assignment problem (Gilmore and Lawler methods). Computational considerations, including trade-offs between length of computation and storage requirements, are discussed and a comparison with dynamic programming is made. Various applications outside the domain of mathematical programming are also mentioned.},

However, those concerns are rarely reflected in how we submit, review, and publish our own work. Specifically, in talking about how our new apps, devices, and algorithms will change the world, we focus almost exclusively on positive consequences. There have been calls to require some speculation about negative impacts as part of the peer review process. This workshop will explore how to think about and report potential negative consequences in our papers in a way that’s practical, inclusive, and achievable. The aim is to draw on scholarship around creative-yet-grounded speculation about technology futures and to consider how these might be applied to publication and peer review. The workshop aims to inspire the CHI conference and the computing research community to meaningfully consider and act upon the potential negative implications of their work.},

abstract = {The increased use of machine learning in recent years led to large volumes of data being manually labeled via crowdsourcing microtasks completed by humans. This brought about dehumanization effects, namely, when task requesters overlook the humans behind the task, leading to issues of ethics (e.g., unfair payment) and amplification of human biases, which are transferred into training data and affect machine learning in the real world. We propose a framework that allocates microtasks considering human factors of workers such as demographics and compensation. We deployed our framework to a popular crowdsourcing platform and conducted experiments with 1,919 workers collecting 160,345 human judgments. By routing microtasks to workers based on demographics and appropriate pay, our framework mitigates biases in the contributor sample and increases the hourly pay given to contributors. We discuss potential extensions and how it can promote transparency in crowdsourcing.},

Exposing participants to VR systems may raise ethical problems due to motion sickness, information overload, intensification of experience, and difficulties with reentry into the real world. The ethical guidelines which are typically applied to psychological research do not cover all of these problems in detail and have to be reconsidered, since they have not been developed with regard to the use of VR systems. Therefore, practical strategies to cope with the addressed ethical problems in VR research are recommended.},

abstract = {In this paper, we argue that, under a specific set of circumstances, designing and employing certain kinds of virtual reality (VR) experiences can be unethical. After a general discussion of simulations and their ethical context, we begin our argument by distinguishing between the experiences generated by different media (text, film, computer game simulation, and VR simulation), and argue that VR experiences offer an unprecedented degree of what we call "perspectival fidelity" that prior modes of simulation lack. Additionally, we argue that when VR experiences couple this perspectival fidelity with what we call "context realism," VR experiences have the ability to produce "virtually real experiences." We claim that virtually real experiences generate ethical issues for VR technologies that are unique to the medium. Because subjects of these experiences treat them as if they were real, a higher degree of ethical scrutiny should be applied to any VR scenario with the potential to generate virtually real experiences. To mitigate this unique moral hazard, we propose and defend what we call "The Equivalence Principle." This principle states that "if it would be wrong to allow subjects to have a certain experience in reality, then it would be wrong to allow subjects to have that experience in a virtually real setting." We argue that such a principle, although limited in scope, should be part of the risk analysis conducted by any Institutional Review Boards, psychologists, empirically oriented philosophers, or game designers who are using VR technology in their work.},

abstract = {Concerns over the risks associated with advances in Artificial Intelligence have prompted calls for greater efforts toward robust and beneficial AI, including machine ethics. Recently, roboticists have responded by initiating the development of so-called ethical robots. These robots would, ideally, evaluate the consequences of their actions and morally justify their choices. This emerging field promises to develop extensively over the next few years. However, in this paper, we point out an inherent limitation of the emerging field of ethical robots. We show that building ethical robots also inevitably enables the construction of unethical robots. In three experiments, we show that it is remarkably easy to modify an ethical robot so that it behaves competitively, or even aggressively. The reason for this is that the cognitive machinery required to make an ethical robot can always be corrupted to make unethical robots. We discuss the implications of this finding to the governance of ethical robots. We conclude that the risks that unscrupulous actors might compromise a robot's ethics are so great as to raise serious doubts over the wisdom of embedding ethical decision making in real-world safety-critical robots, such as driverless cars.},

abstract = {The data revolution continues to transform every sector of science, industry, and government. Due to the incredible impact of data-driven technology on society, we are becoming increasingly aware of the imperative to use data and algorithms responsibly—in accordance with laws and ethical norms. In this article, we discuss three recent regulatory frameworks: the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the New York City Automated Decisions Systems (ADS) Law, and the Net Neutrality principle, which aim to protect the rights of individuals who are impacted by data collection and analysis. These frameworks are prominent examples of a global trend: Governments are starting to recognize the need to regulate data-driven algorithmic technology.Our goal in this article is to bring these regulatory frameworks to the attention of the data management community and to underscore the technical challenges they raise and that we, as a community, are well-equipped to address. The main takeaway of this article is that legal and ethical norms cannot be incorporated into data-driven systems as an afterthought. Rather, we must think in terms of responsibility by design, viewing it as a systems requirement.},

abstract = {Algorithms and decision making based on Big Data have become pervasive in all aspects of our daily lives lives (offline and online), as they have become essential tools in personal finance, health care, hiring, housing, education, and policies. It is therefore of societal and ethical importance to ask whether these algorithms can be discriminative on grounds such as gender, ethnicity, or health status. It turns out that the answer is positive: for instance, recent studies in the context of online advertising show that ads for high-income jobs are presented to men much more often than to women [Datta et al., 2015]; and ads for arrest records are significantly more likely to show up on searches for distinctively black names [Sweeney, 2013]. This algorithmic bias exists even when there is no discrimination intention in the developer of the algorithm. Sometimes it may be inherent to the data sources used (software making decisions based on data can reflect, or even amplify, the results of historical discrimination), but even when the sensitive attributes have been suppressed from the input, a well trained machine learning algorithm may still discriminate on the basis of such sensitive attributes because of correlations existing in the data. These considerations call for the development of data mining systems which are discrimination-conscious by-design. This is a novel and challenging research area for the data mining community.The aim of this tutorial is to survey algorithmic bias, presenting its most common variants, with an emphasis on the algorithmic techniques and key ideas developed to derive efficient solutions. The tutorial covers two main complementary approaches: algorithms for discrimination discovery and discrimination prevention by means of fairness-aware data mining. We conclude by summarizing promising paths for future research.},

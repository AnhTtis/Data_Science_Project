\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we share how computer science researchers anticipate the UCs of their research innovations and the challenges they may face from doing so throughout the research process. Through our interviews with 20 computer science researchers affiliated with North American research universities, we learned that our interviewees do not have a specific process or strategy for considering UCs. 
Our interviews surfaced two major barriers to anticipating UCs for researchers including a lack of formal methods and guidelines for anticipating them and academic practices that promote fast progress and frequent publications.
Based on our findings, we outline key opportunities to support researchers in these efforts by incentivizing the investigation of UCs throughout the research process, the creation of new tools to support brainstorming, and the implementation of reactionary guidelines. We hope that our work will encourage further discussions on how academic innovators can be supported in the prevention of unintended effects of technology on society.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have proposed a novel video shadow removal method, termed PSTNet, by considering three shadow related characteristics: physical, spatio, and temporal.
%%
We present an improved physical characteristic to represent the impact of complex lighting and texture conditions on image shadow. 
%%
Adaptive exposure estimation module together with mask-guided supervised attention module enable us to get reliable physical features. %%
The multi-characteristic fusion module effectively combines the three kinds of features. 
%%
Due to the lack of existing video shadow removal dataset for training models, we also collect a synthetic dataset of 85 paired videos, termed SVSRD-85. 
%%
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PSTNet performs best on SVSRD-85 dataset. 
%%
Moreover, we propose a model transformation strategy to make our synthetic-driven model effective in real world scenes.
In future, we plan to further study how to overcome the domain bias between synthetic scenes and real scenes.
%thereby using synthetic paired data and real unpaired data to train a robust video shadow removal model.
%In this paper, we have proposed a novel and robust overexposure fusion method for performing shadow removal task. Multiple over-exposure, relighting each pixel with different exposures, could compensate each pixel individually to tackle position speciﬁed color and illumination degradation. It beneﬁts the shadow removal task by recovering the natural image from the spatial variant color and illumination degradation. Shadow-aware FusionNet smartly fuses brackets of over-exposure shadow images with shadow image by an adaptive per-pixel kernel weight map. It helps to fully recover the background content preserving the color and illumination details. The proposed boundary-aware ReﬁneNet further eliminates the remaining trace caused by the penumbra area along the shadow boundary. With the boundary loss added, by optimizing to preserve the non-shadow region and recover the ground-truth shadow-free area of the shadow image, our work can obtain traceless background with the state-of-the-art shadow removal performance on the ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD datasets. In future, we plan to solve the challenging video shadow removal problem.

\begin{abstract}
Shadow removal in a single image has received increasing attention in recent years. However, removing shadows over dynamic scenes remains largely under-explored.  In this paper, we propose the first data-driven video shadow removal model, termed PSTNet, by exploiting three essential characteristics of video shadows, i.e., physical property, spatio relation, and temporal coherence. Specifically, a dedicated physical branch was established to conduct local illumination estimation, which is more applicable for scenes with complex lighting and textures, and then enhance the physical features via a mask-guided attention strategy. Then, we develop a progressive aggregation module to enhance the spatio and temporal characteristics of features maps, and effectively integrate the three kinds of features. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of datasets of paired shadow videos, we synthesize a dataset (SVSRD-85) with aid of the popular game GTAV by controlling the switch of the shadow renderer. Experiments against 9 state-of-the-art models, including image shadow removers and image/video restoration methods, show that our method improves the best SOTA in terms of RMSE error for the shadow area by $14.7\%$. In addition, we develop a lightweight model adaptation strategy to make our synthetic-driven model effective in real world scenes. The visual comparison on the public SBU-TimeLapse dataset verifies the generalization ability of our model in real scenes.
% Shadow removal in a single image has recently received great research interest. However, the shadow removal over dynamic scenes is still under-exploring.
%%
%Different with the existing methods mainly based on the spatial and temporal characteristics featuring by CNN feature and optical flow, we introduce a novel physical characteristic to present the relation between the complex lighting and object shadow. 
%%
% In this paper, we develop the first data-driven video shadow removal model, termed PSTNet, by fusing three important representations of video shadows (i.e., physical, saptio and temporal). Specifically, PSTNet construct three independent branches to learn physical, saptio and temporal features and then fuse them to refine the the final video shadow removal results in a progressive manner. 
% %
% The physical branch uses a linear illumination transformation to model the shadow effects, which consider the illumination similarity of the shadow regions. In addition, to avoid the problem that global uniform lighting estimation is not applicable in scenes dealing with complex lighting and textures, we propose the Adaptive Exposure Estimation Module (AEEM) to construct the linear illumination transformation for different shadow regions. Next, the spatio and temporal branches are introduced to maintain the spatial resolution and temporal coherence of the removal results, respectively.
% Our method exploits three kinds of characteristics related to shadows in dynamic scenes, i.e. the physical characteristic, spatial characteristic, and temporal characteristic. 
%%
% We resort to the physical characteristic branch to mine the differences between shadow and non-shadow regions in the illumination model.
%mine the relation between complex lighting/texture conditions and image shadows. 
%
% In addition, to maintain the spatial resolution and temporal coherence of the prediction results, we introduce the spatio and temporal characteristic branches, respectively. 
%and develop an adaptive exposure estimation module and a mask-guided supervised attention module to extract reliable physical features. 
% And then, a dedicated feature fusion module aggregates multi-characteristic features to refine the shadow removal results in a progressive manner. 
% %%
% Furthermore, facing the lack of well-established datasets of paired shadow videos, we synthesize a dataset (SVSRD-85) in the popular game GTAV by controlling the switch of the shadow renderer.
% %%%
% Experiments in SVSRD-85 against 9 state-of-the-art models, including single image shadow removers and image/video restoration methods, 
% %%
% show that our method improves the state-of-the-art in terms of RMSE error for the shadow area by $14.7\%$.
% %%
% In addition, we propose a model transformation strategy to make our synthetic-driven model effective in real world scenes. The visual comparison in SBU-TimeLapse dataset can evaluate the generalization ability of our model in real scenes.

%Last, we also evaluate PSTNet on the SBU-Timelapse dataset that provides unpaired real shadow scenes, to prove the generalizability of our method.

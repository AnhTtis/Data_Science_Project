    "abstract": "In this paper, we first develop a complete perturbation theory requiring only the perturbation of the fundamental quantities describing Teleparallel Gravity. We first obtain the physical quantities by perturbing the coframes taking into account the gauge metric and spin-connection conditions. We obtain the perturbed field equations involving these perturbed quantities. We will study some specific cases of perturbations of coframes and finally discuss the stability of the Minkowski background. Our perturbation framework is based on using a proper orthonormal frame throughout, which is possible since we remain with a theory of Teleparallel Gravity.",

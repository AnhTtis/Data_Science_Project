    "abstract": "The two-Higgs-doublet model with a $U(1)_H$ gauge symmetry (N2HDM-$U(1)$) has several advantages compared to the $Z_2$ version (N2HDM-$Z_2$): It is purely based on gauge symmetries, involves only spontaneous symmetry breaking and is more predictive because it contains one less free parameter in its Higgs potential which ensures $CP$ conservation at the same time. However, the phenomenology of its Higgs sector has been barely studied. After pointing out that a second, so far unknown version of the N2HDM-$U(1)$ exists, we examine the phenomenological consequences of the differences in the scalar potentials. In particular, we find that while the N2HDM-$Z_2$ predicts suppressed branching ratios for decays into different Higgses for small scalar mixing (as suggested by Higgs coupling measurements), both versions of the N2HDM-$U(1)$ allow for sizable rates. This is particularly important in light of the CMS excess in Higgs pair production at around $650\\,$GeV decaying a Standard Model Higgs decaying to photons and a new scalar with a mass of $\\approx90\\,$GeV decaying to bottom quarks (i.e., compatible with the CMS $γγ$ excess at $95\\,$GeV), which, as we will show, can be explained within the N2HDM-$U(1)$, predicting an interesting and unavoidable $Z+ b\\bar b$ signature.",

    "abstract": "We consider a system of $N$ non-crossing Brownian particles in one dimension. We find the exact rate function that describes the long-time large deviation statistics of their occupation fraction in a finite interval in space. Remarkably, we find that, for any general $N \\geq 2$, the system undergoes $N-1$ dynamical phase transitions of second order. The $N-1$ transitions are the boundaries of $N$ phases that correspond to different numbers of particles which are in the vicinity of the interval throughout the dynamics. We achieve this by mapping the problem to that of finding the ground-state energy for $N$ noninteracting spinless fermions in a square-well potential. The phases correspond to different numbers of single-body bound states for the quantum problem. We also study the process conditioned on a given occupation fraction and the large-$N$ limiting behavior.",

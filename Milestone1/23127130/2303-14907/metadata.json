    "abstract": "We study weakly invertible cells in weak $ω$-categories in the sense of Batanin-Leinster, adopting the coinductive definition of weak invertibility. We show that weakly invertible cells in a weak $ω$-category are closed under globular pasting. Using this, we generalise elementary properties of weakly invertible cells known to hold in strict $ω$-categories to weak $ω$-categories, and show that every weak $ω$-category has a largest weak $ω$-subgroupoid.",

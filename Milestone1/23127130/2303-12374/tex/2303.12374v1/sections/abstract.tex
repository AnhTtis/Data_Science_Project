\emph{Graphic Processing Units} (GPUs) have become ubiquitous in scientific computing.
However, writing efficient GPU kernels can be challenging due to the need for careful code tuning.
To automatically explore the kernel optimization space, several auto-tuning tools -- like Kernel Tuner -- have been proposed. 
Unfortunately, these existing auto-tuning tools do not concern themselves with integration of tuning results back into applications, which puts a significant implementation and maintenance burden on application developers.
In this work, we present \emph{Kernel Launcher}: an easy-to-use C++ library that simplifies the creation of highly-tuned CUDA applications. With Kernel Launcher, programmers can \emph{capture} kernel launches, \emph{tune} the captured kernels for different setups, and \emph{integrate} the tuning results back into applications using runtime compilation. 
To showcase the applicability of Kernel Launcher, we consider a real-world computational fluid dynamics code and tune its kernels for different GPUs, input domains, and precisions.

Writing efficient GPU code is considered challenging, since obtaining optimal performance requires careful code tuning.
Auto-tuning tools, like Kernel Tuner, are designed to explore the kernel optimization space automatically.
However, existing auto-tuning tools are limited in their capability to create optimal-performance portable applications, putting a significant implementation and maintenance burden on application developers.
In this work, we : An easy-to-use C++ library that simplifies the creation of highly-tuned CUDA applications.

\emph{capture} kernel launches, 
\emph{tune} the captured kernels for different setups, 
and \emph{integrate} the tuning results back into applications using \emph{runtime compilation}.

We show that Kernel Launcher can be used to create performance-portable CUDA applications by considering a real-world computational fluid dynamics code and tuning two kernels for different GPUs, input domains, and precision.

% Stijn: We need more concrete results, like x% speedup in y% of the cases
% Ben: Dat is nou net lastig want Kernel Launcher geeft altijd 100% performance, je kan hooguit laten zien dat er beperkingen zijn als je minder goed tuned

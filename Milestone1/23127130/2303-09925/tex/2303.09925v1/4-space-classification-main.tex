\begin{abstract}
    In this work, we present an exhaustive classification of the 2644 causally complete spaces on 3 events with binary inputs, together with the algorithm used for the classification.
    %and partial results from the ongoing search for causally complete spaces on 4 events with binary inputs.
    This paper forms the supplementary material for a trilogy of works: spaces of input histories, our dynamical generalisation of causal orders, were introduced in ``The Combinatorics of Causality''; the sheaf-theoretic treatment of causal distributions was detailed in ``The Topology of Causality''; the polytopes formed by the associated empirical models were studied in ``The Geometry of Causality''.

	abstract = {Topological insulators are new states of quantum matter with surface states protected by the time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we perform first-principle electronic structure calculations for \$Sb\_2Te\_3\$, \$Sb\_2Se\_3\$, \$Bi\_2Te\_3\$ and \$Bi\_2Se\_3\$ crystals. Our calculations predict that \$Sb\_2Te\_3\$, \$Bi\_2Te\_3\$ and \$Bi\_2Se\_3\$ are topological insulators, while \$Sb\_2Se\_3\$ is not. In particular, \$Bi\_2Se\_3\$ has a topologically non-trivial energy gap of \$0.3 eV\$, suitable for room temperature applications. We present a simple and unified continuum model which captures the salient topological features of this class of materials. These topological insulators have robust surface states consisting of a single Dirac cone at the \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ point.},

We focus on long junctions for which several channels intervene in the tunneling coupling through the junction. We present a description of the topological edge modes for different TRITOPS models including \$p\$-wave pairing and the combination of \$s\$-wave pairing with spin-orbit coupling. We derive effective low-energy Hamiltonians to describe the Josephson junction, which can be solved analytically to explain the contribution of the edge states to the Josephson current as a function of the phase bias. We find that edge-modes yield singular corrections to the CPR for both junction types. The primary effects occur for the response of the Majorana zero-modes at half-flux quantum phase \${\textbackslash}phi{\textbackslash}approx {\textbackslash}pi\$ in TRITOPS-TRITOPS junctions and for integer flux quantum phase \${\textbackslash}phi {\textbackslash}approx 0\$ for TRITOPS-S junctions, respectively. The former effect is particularly strong two-component nematic superconductors. The latter effect leads to a spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry in the TRITOPS-S junction and to a breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence.},

The platform uses conventional superconducting electrodes deposited on a topological insulator film to form networks of proximity-coupled lateral Josephson junctions. Magnetic fields threading the network of junction barriers create Josephson vortices that host Majorana bound states localized in the junction where the local phase difference is an odd multiple of \${\textbackslash}pi\$, i.e. attached to the cores of the Josephson vortices. This enables us to manipulate the Majorana states by moving the Josephson vortices, achieving functionality exclusive to these systems in contrast to others, such as those composed of topological superconductor nanowires. We describe protocols for: 1) braiding localized Majorana states by exchange, 2) controlling the separation and hence the coupling of adjacent localized Majorana states to effect non-Abelian rotations via hybridization of the Majorana modes, and 3) reading out changes in the non-local parity correlations induced by such operations. These schemes make use of the application of current pulses and local magnetic field pulses to control the location of vortices, and measurements of the Josephson current-phase relation to reveal the presence of the Majorana bound states. We describe the architecture and schemes in the context of experiments currently underway.},

This effect is a consequence of the composite nature of the Higgs field of superconductivity and the broken Lorentz invariance in a solid. Most importantly, the breakdown of the Higgs mechanism inside the superconducting coherence volume is crucial to ensure the stability of the BCS mean-field theory in the weak-coupling limit. We also show that changes in the gap equation due to plasmon-induced fluctuations can lead to significant corrections to the mean-field theory and reveal that changes in the density-fluctuation spectrum of a superconductor are not limited to the vicinity of the gap.},

Despite this long history the unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an outstanding goal. This review article highlights recent advances in the condensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe that this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail exotic `topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support Majorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of the key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is possible to `engineer' such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming appropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous proposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as topological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals, and many others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects Majorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes of measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling, Josephson effects, and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable properties of condensed matter Majorana fermions--the non-Abelian exchange statistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum computation.},

We clarify how the coefficients of the terms with one time derivative and those with two time derivatives in the effective Lagrangian determine the order parameters specifying whether the system is in a ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic state; we stress that the gapped mode related to the spontaneous symmetry breaking appears only in the ferrimagnetic system and not in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. We also establish the power counting scheme and calculate the scattering amplitudes and thereby the scattering lengths between the two Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We show that the scattering length of the gapped mode is finite and proportional to the gap. This characteristic property of the gapped NG mode can be used to discriminate it from gapped excitations which originate in other mechanisms. Finally, we study the effects of the explicit symmetry breaking that are given by an external magnetic field and a single-ion anisotropy, and show that the external magnetic fields do not have any effects on the scattering amplitudes in all the spin systems as was known for the ferromagnet system. In contrast, the anisotropy does affect the scattering amplitudes, the phase shift, and the scattering length except for spin 1/2 systems. This result supports the possibility of the Efimov effect in spin systems discussed in previous studies.},

Our multiple n-twisted kink solution contains 2n parameters, and each kink has one bound state. Each kink can be placed at any position, while the selfconsistency of the system requires the phase shift of each kink to be quantized by π/N with the number of ﬂavors N. Our solution describes multiple grey solitons in ultracold atomic fermion gases, and our predictions require experimental veriﬁcation. The dynamics and scattering of these solitons should be studied as a future research topic. Further research also needs to be conducted on the construction of self-consistent solutions under non-uniform boundary conditions.},

Here we study the equations governing the dynamics of phase solitons (fluxons) in a long Josephson junction in a topological superconductor. We show that the fluxon will bind a localized zero energy Majorana mode and will consequently behave as a non-Abelian anyon. The low mass of the fluxon, as well as its experimentally observed quantum mechanical wave-like nature, will make it a suitable candidate for vortex interferometry experiments demonstrating non-Abelian statistics. We suggest two experiments that may reveal the presence of the zero mode carried by the fluxon. Specific experimental realizations will be discussed as well.},

Here we show that the Higgs mechanism breaks down for length scales shorter than the superconducting coherence length while it stays intact, even at high energies, in the long-wavelength limit. This effect is a consequence of the composite nature of the Higgs field of superconductivity and the broken Lorentz invariance in a solid. Most importantly, the breakdown of the Higgs mechanism inside the superconducting coherence volume is crucial to ensure the stability of the BCS mean-field theory in the weak-coupling limit. We also show that changes in the gap equation due to plasmon-induced fluctuations can lead to significant corrections to the mean-field theory and reveal that changes in the density-fluctuation spectrum of a superconductor are not limited to the vicinity of the gap.},

	abstract = {We review in detail the construction of all stable static fermion bags in the (1 þ 1)-dimensional Gross–Neveu model with N ﬂavors of Dirac fermions, in the large-N limit. In addition to the well known kink and topologically trivial solitons (which correspond, respectively, to the spinor and antisymmetric tensor representations of Oð2NÞ), there are also threshold bound states of a kink and a topologically trivial soliton: the heavier topological solitons (HTS). The mass of any of these newly discovered HTSÕs is the sum of masses of its solitonic constituents and it corresponds to the tensor product of their Oð2N Þ representations. Thus, it is marginally stable (at least in the large-N limit). Furthermore, its mass is independent of the distance between the centers of its constituents, which serves as a ﬂat collective coordinate, or a modulus. There are no additional stable static solitons in the Gross–Neveu model. We provide detailed derivation of the proﬁles, masses, and fermion number contents of these static solitons. For pedagogical clarity, and in order for this paper to be self-contained, we also included detailed appendices on supersymmetric quantum mechanics and on reﬂectionless potentials in one spatial dimension, which are intimately related with the theory of static fermion bags. In particular, we present a novel simple explicit formula for the diagonal resolvent of a reﬂectionless Schro€dinger operator with an arbitrary number of bound states. In additional appendices we summarize the relevant group representation theoretic facts and also provide a simple calculation of the mass of the kinks.},

	abstract = {One-dimensional topological superconductors are known to host Majorana zero modes at domain walls terminating the topological phase. Their nonabelian nature allows for processing quantum information by braiding operations which are insensitive to local perturbations, making Majorana zero modes a promising platform for topological quantum computation. Motivated by the ultimate goal of executing quantum information processing on a finite timescale, we study domain walls moving at a constant velocity. We exploit an effective Lorentz invariance of the Hamiltonian to obtain an exact solution of the associated quasiparticle spectrum and wave functions for arbitrary velocities. Essential features of the solution have a natural interpretation in terms of the familiar relativistic effects of Lorentz contraction and time dilation. We find that the Majorana zero modes remain stable as long as the domain wall moves at subluminal velocities with respect to the effective speed of light of the system. However, the Majorana bound state dissolves into a continuous quasiparticle spectrum once the domain wall propagates at luminal or even superluminal velocities. This relativistic catastrophe implies that there is an upper limit for possible braiding frequencies even in a perfectly clean system with an arbitrarily large topological gap. We also exploit our exact solution to consider domain walls moving past static impurities present in the system.},

	abstract = {We analyze pairing of fermions in two dimensions for fully-gapped cases with broken parity (P) and time-reversal (T), especially cases in which the gap function is an orbital angular momentum (\$l\$) eigenstate, in particular \$l=-1\$ (p-wave, spinless or spin-triplet) and \$l=-2\$ (d-wave, spin-singlet). For \$l{\textbackslash}neq0\$, these fall into two phases, weak and strong pairing, which may be distinguished topologically. In the cases with conserved spin, we derive explicitly the Hall conductivity for spin as the corresponding topological invariant. For the spinless p-wave case, the weak-pairing phase has a pair wavefunction that is asympototically the same as that in the Moore-Read (Pfaffian) quantum Hall state, and we argue that its other properties (edge states, quasihole and toroidal ground states) are also the same, indicating that nonabelian statistics is a \{{\textbackslash}em generic\} property of such a paired phase. The strong-pairing phase is an abelian state, and the transition between the two phases involves a bulk Majorana fermion, the mass of which changes sign at the transition. For the d-wave case, we argue that the Haldane-Rezayi state is not the generic behavior of a phase but describes the asymptotics at the critical point between weak and strong pairing, and has gapless fermion excitations in the bulk. In this case the weak-pairing phase is an abelian phase which has been considered previously. In the p-wave case with an unbroken U(1) symmetry, which can be applied to the double layer quantum Hall problem, the weak-pairing phase has the properties of the 331 state, and with nonzero tunneling there is a transition to the Moore-Read phase. The effects of disorder on noninteracting quasiparticles are considered.},

In the homogenous case a winding number can be deﬁned whose nonvanishing value signals topological eﬀects. A vortex leads to a static, isolated, zero energy solution. Its mode function is real, and has been called “Majorana.” Here we demonstrate that the reality/Majorana feature is not conﬁned to the zero energy mode, but characterizes the full quantum ﬁeld. In a four-component description a change of basis for the relevant matrices renders the Hamiltonian imaginary and the full, spacetime dependent ﬁeld is real, as is the case for the relativistic Majorana equation in the Majorana matrix representation. More broadly, we show that the Majorana quantization procedure is generic to superconductors, with or without the Dirac structure, and follows from the constraints of fermionic statistics on the symmetries of Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians. The Hamiltonian can always be brought to an imaginary form, leading to equations of motion that are real with quantized real ﬁeld solutions. Also we examine the Fock space realization of the zero mode algebra for the Dirac-type systems. We show that a two-dimensional representation is natural, in which fermion parity is preserved.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator, but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. The 2D topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A 3D topological insulator supports novel spin polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium article we will review the theoretical foundation for these electronic states and describe recent experiments in which their signatures have been observed. We will describe transport experiments on HgCdTe quantum wells that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. We will then discuss experiments on Bi\_\{1-x\}Sb\_x, Bi\_2 Se\_3, Bi\_2 Te\_3 and Sb\_2 Te\_3 that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. We will then describe exotic states that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions, and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. We will close by discussing prospects for observing these exotic states, a well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

	abstract = {A fully analytical theory of a traveling soliton in a one-dimensional fermionic superfluid is developed within the framework of time-dependent self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which are solved exactly in the Andreev approximation. The soliton manifests itself in a kink-like profile of the superconducting order parameter and hosts a pair of Andreev bound states in its core. They adjust to soliton's motion and play an important role in its stabilization. A phase jump across the soliton and its energy decrease with soliton's velocity and vanish at the critical velocity, corresponding to the Landau criterion, where the soliton starts emitting quasiparticles and becomes unstable. The "inertial" and "gravitational" masses of the soliton are calculated and the former is shown to be orders of magnitude larger than the latter. This results in a slow motion of the soliton in a harmonic trap, reminiscent to the observed behavior of a soliton-like texture in related experiments in cold fermion gases [T. Yefsah et al., Nature 499, 426, (2013)]. Furthermore, we calculate the full non-linear dispersion relation of the soliton and solve the classical equations of motion in a trap. The strong non-linearity at high velocities gives rise to anharmonic oscillatory motion of the soliton. A careful analysis of this anharmonicity may provide a means to experimentally measure the non-linear soliton spectrum in superfluids.},

In particular, there is now a much deeper understanding of why certain potentials are analytically solvable and an array of powerful new approximation methods for handling potentials which are not exactly solvable. In this report, we review the theoretical formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and discuss many applications. Exactly solvable potentials can be understood in terms of a few basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials, shape invariance and operator transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all have the property of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shape invariant potentials which include the recently discovered self-similar potentials as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering, isospectral potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed and multi-soliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximation methods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry inspired WKB approximation is exact for a class of shape invariant potentials. Supersymmetry ideas give particularly nice results for the tunneling rate in a double well potential and for improving large \$N\$ expansions. We also discuss the problem of a charged Dirac particle in an external magnetic field and other potentials in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, we discuss structures more general than supersymmetric quantum mechanics such as parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics in which there is a symmetry between a boson and a para-fermion of order \$p\$.},

Low energy models allowing to grasp their properties are hence conceptually important. The usual scenario in these models is that two relevant gapped phases, separated by a gapless point, exist. In one of the phases, topological boundary states are absent, while the other one supports Majorana bound states. We show that a customary model violates this paradigm. The phase that should not host Majorana fermions supports a fractional soliton exponentially localized at only one end. By varying the parameters of the model, we describe analytically the transition between the fractional soliton and two Majorana fermions. Moreover, we provide a possible physical implementation of the model. We further characterize the symmetry of the superconducting pairing, showing that the odd-frequency component is intimately related to the spatial profile of the Majorana wavefunctions.},

While in the non-interacting limit both models are equivalent (in particular, belong to the same symmetry class BDI and flow towards the same infinite-randomness critical fixed point), their behavior differs drastically once interaction is added. Our density-matrix renormalization group calculations show that the complex-fermion chain remains at the non-interacting fixed point. On the other hand, the Majorana fermion chain experiences a spontaneous symmetry breaking and localizes for repulsive interaction. To explain the instability of the critical Majorana chain with respect to a combined effect of interaction and disorder, we consider interaction as perturbation to the infinite-randomness fixed point and calculate numerically two-wavefunction correlation functions that enter interaction matrix elements. The numerical results supported by analytical arguments exhibit a rich structure of critical eigenstate correlations. This allows us to identify a relevant interaction operator that drives the Majorana chain away from the infinite randomness fixed point. For the case of complex fermions, the interaction is irrelevant.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive theory of spintronics phenomena based on the concept of effective gauge field, the spin gauge field. An effective gauge field generally arises when we change a basis to describe system and describes low energy properties of the system. In the case of ferromagnetic metals we consider, it arises from structures of localized spin (magnetization) and couples to spin current of conduction electron. The first half of the paper is devoted to quantum mechanical arguments and phenomenology. We show that the spin gauge field has adiabatic and nonadiabatic (off-diagonal) components, consisting an SU(2) gauge field. The adiabatic component gives rise to spin Berry's phase, topological Hall effect and spin motive force, while nonadiabatic components are essential for spin-transfer torque and spin pumping effects by inducing nonequilibrium spin accumulation. In the latter part of the paper, field theoretic approaches are described. Dynamics of localized spins in the presence of applied spin-polarized current is studied in a microscopic viewpoint, and current-driven domain wall motion is discussed. Recent developments on interface spin-orbit interaction are also mentioned.},

They are the first known examples of topological order in bulk solids. We review the basic phenomena and experimental history, starting with the observation of topological insulator behavior in Bi\$\_x\$Sb\$\_\{1-x\}\$ by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and continuing through measurements on other materials and by other probes. A self-contained introduction to the single-particle theory is then given, followed by the many-particle definition of a topological insulator as a material with quantized magnetoelectric polarizability. The last section reviews recent work on strongly correlated topological insulators and new effects that arise from the proximity effect between a topological insulator and a superconductor. While this article is not intended to be a comprehensive review of what is already a rather large field, we hope that it will serve as a useful introduction, summary of recent progress, and guideline to future directions.},

Solving first the equilibrium equations for S/N and S/F bilayers and Josephson junctions, we study the superconducting proximity effect in Dirac materials. Similarly to related works, we find that the effect of an exchange field depends strongly on the direction of the field. Only components normal to the transport direction lead to attenuation of the Cooper pair wavefunction inside the F. Fields parallel to the transport direction lead to phase-shifts in the dependence on the superconducting phase difference for both the charge current and density of states in an S/F/S-junction. Moreover, we compute the differential conductance in S/N and S/F bilayers with an applied voltage bias, and determine the dependence on the length of the N and F regions and the exchange field.},

	abstract = {Josephson junctions based on three-dimensional topological insulators offer intriguing possibilities to realize unconventional \$p\$-wave pairing and Majorana modes. Here, we provide a detailed study of the effect of a uniform magnetization in the normal region: We show how the interplay between the spin-momentum locking of the topological insulator and an in-plane magnetization parallel to the direction of phase bias leads to an asymmetry of the Andreev spectrum with respect to transverse momenta. If sufficiently large, this asymmetry induces a transition from a regime of gapless, counterpropagating Majorana modes to a regime with unprotected modes that are unidirectional at small transverse momenta. Intriguingly, the magnetization-induced asymmetry of the Andreev spectrum also gives rise to a Josephson Hall effect, that is, the appearance of a transverse Josephson current. The amplitude and current phase relation of the Josephson Hall current are studied in detail. In particular, we show how magnetic control and gating of the normal region can enable sizable Josephson Hall currents compared to the longitudinal Josephson current. Finally, we also propose in-plane magnetic fields as an alternative to the magnetization in the normal region and discuss how the planar Josephson Hall effect could be observed in experiments.},

	abstract = {To realize fault-tolerant quantum computing, it is necessary to store quantum information in logical qubits with error correction functions, realized by distributing a logical state among multiple physical qubits or by encoding it in the Hilbert space of a high-dimensional system. Quantum gate operations between these error-correctable logical qubits, which are essential for implementation of any practical quantum computational task, have not been experimentally demonstrated yet. Here we demonstrate a geometric method for realizing controlled-phase gates between two logical qubits encoded in photonic fields stored in cavities. The gates are realized by dispersively coupling an ancillary superconducting qubit to these cavities and driving it to make a cyclic evolution depending on the joint photonic state of the cavities, which produces a conditional geometric phase. We first realize phase gates for photonic qubits with the logical basis states encoded in two quasiorthogonal coherent states, which have important implications for continuous-variable-based quantum computation. Then we use this geometric method to implement a controlled-phase gate between two binomially encoded logical qubits, which have an error-correctable function.},

	abstract = {Quantum mechanical effects at the macroscopic level were first explored in Josephson junction-based superconducting circuits in the 1980's. In the last twenty years, the emergence of quantum information science has intensified research toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information processors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly and controllably interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic fields stored in superconducting circuits, led to the creation of the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of this review. While atomic cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right. Circuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all current approaches to quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. In addition, circuit QED enables the study of hybrid quantum systems interacting with microwave photons. Here, we review the coherent coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators focussing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit, and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system. We discuss coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is necessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit QED, we discuss important use cases of these ideas in quantum information processing and in quantum optics.},

    "abstract": "We generalise the notion of the Pseudo-Laplacian on a hyperbolic Riemann surface with one cusp, that was studied by Lax and Phillips and Colin de Verdière, by considering a boundary condition of Robin type for the constant term instead of the classical Dirichlet condition. The resulting family of Pseudo-Laplacians is a holomorphic family of unbounded operators in the sense of Kato. By use of holomorphic perturbation theory, we study the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this family and give a new proof for the meromorphic continuation of the Eisenstein series.",

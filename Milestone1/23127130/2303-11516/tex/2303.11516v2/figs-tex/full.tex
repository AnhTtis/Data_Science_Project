   \caption{\textbf{Difference between other differentiable PnP losses and our proposed loss.} Other methods (first row) first solve for the object pose from noisy correspondences, and then compute the loss based on the resulting pose and the ground truth. By contrast, we (second row) utilize the ground-truth pose to estimate the residual variance of the correspondences and compute the covariance of the pose distribution. We define our loss based on the diagonal  elements of this covariance.}

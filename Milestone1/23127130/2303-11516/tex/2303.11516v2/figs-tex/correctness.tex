   \caption{\textbf{Correctness curves of the PnP layers.}  A 3D point is considered to have a correct gradient if moving in the negative gradient direction leads to a smaller 2D reprojection error. The LC loss yields almost 100\% correctness. The correctness of EPro-PnP drops slowly, and ending with about 59\% correctness. BPnP drops quickly when training begins, and ends with about 53\% correctness. The dark curves are smoothed versions of the light ones.}

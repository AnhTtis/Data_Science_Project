   \caption{\textbf{Binary vertex encoding schemes.} (a) Global vertex encoding. Vertex codes are used as indices of the vertex table for coordinates lookup. (b) Coordinate wise encoding. Treating the vertex codes as normalized object coordinates, we keep the probability of the most significant mispredicted bit un-rounded and correct other bits before weighted summation. (c) If all predictions are correct, the least significant bit is kept un-rounded. In this figure, ``p'' is short for ``probability'', ``c'' is ``code'', ``w'' is ``weight'', and ``g.t.'' is ``ground-truth''. We omit the z direction for simplicity.}

    "abstract": "In conventional plasmonic media and plasmonic metamaterials, such as metallic wire mesh, longitudinal mode of electromagnetic wave manifests itself in frequency overlapping transverse modes, which impedes clear observation of longitudinal-mode-specific physical effects. Through interlacing two sets of wire meshes, an ideal band for longitudinal mode is achieved ranging from zero frequency to plasma frequency where transverse modes are completely forbidden. The unique spectral separation of modes facilitates the observation of pure longitudinal mode and related plasmonic effects in bulk medium. We report the first experiment of anomalous optical transmission, induced solely by electromagnetic longitudinal mode resonance, below plasma frequency in the wire mesh medium.",

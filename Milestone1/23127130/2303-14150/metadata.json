    "abstract": "Symmetries are known to dictate important physical properties and can be used as a design principle in particular in wave physics, including wave structures and the resulting propagation dynamics. Local symmetries, in the sense of a symmetry that holds only in a finite domain of space, can be either the result of a self-organization process or a structural ingredient into a synthetically prepared physical system. Applying local symmetry operations to extend a given finite chain we show that the resulting one-dimensional lattice consists of a transient followed by a subsequent periodic behaviour. Due to the fact that, by construction, the implanted local symmetries strongly overlap the resulting lattice possesses a dense skeleton of such symmetries. We proof this behaviour on the basis of a class of local symmetry operations allowing us to conclude upon the 'asymptotic' properties such as the final period, decomposition of the unit-cell and the length and decomposition of the transient. As an example case, we explore the corresponding tight-binding Hamiltonians. Their energy eigenvalue spectra and eigenstates are analyzed in some detail, showing in particular the strong variability of the localization properties of the eigenstates due to the presence of a plethora of local symmetries.",

    "abstract": "Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve a specific boundary value problem is becoming more popular as an alternative to traditional methods. However, depending on the specific problem, they could be computationally expensive and potentially less accurate. The functionality of PINNs for real-world physical problems can significantly improve if they become more flexible and adaptable. To address this, our work explores the idea of training a PINN for general boundary conditions and source terms expressed through a limited number of coefficients, introduced as additional inputs in the network. Although this process increases the dimensionality and is computationally costly, using the trained network to evaluate new general solutions is much faster. Our results indicate that PINN solutions are relatively accurate, reliable, and well-behaved. We applied this idea to the astrophysical scenario of the magnetic field evolution in the interior of a neutron star connected to a force-free magnetosphere. Solving this problem through a global simulation in the entire domain is expensive due to the elliptic solver's needs for the exterior solution. The computational cost with a PINN was more than an order of magnitude lower than the similar case solved with classical methods. These results pave the way for the future extension to 3D of this (or a similar) problem, where generalised boundary conditions are very costly to implement.",

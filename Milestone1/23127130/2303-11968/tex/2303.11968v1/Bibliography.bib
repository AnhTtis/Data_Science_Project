The phenomenology of their emission and spectral properties strongly support the idea that the magnetospheres of these astrophysical objects are tightly twisted in the vicinity of the star. Previous studies on equilibrium configurations have so far focused on either the internal or the external magnetic field configuration, without considering a real coupling between the two fields. Here, we investigate numerical equilibrium models of magnetized neutron stars endowed with a confined twisted magnetosphere, solving the general relativistic Grad–Shafranov equation both in the interior and in the exterior of the compact object. A comprehensive study of the parameters space is provided, to investigate the effects of different current distributions on the overall magnetic field structure.}",

    abstract = "{A radiative model for the soft gamma repeaters and the energetic 1979 March 5 burst is presented. We identify the sources of these bursts with neutron stars the external magnetic fields of which are much stronger than those of ordinary pulsars. Several independent arguments point to a neutron star with Bdipole ~ 5 × 1014 G as the source of the March 5 event. A very strong field can (i) spin down the star to an 8-s period in the ~ 104-yr age of the surrounding supernova remnant N49; (ii) provide enough energy for the March 5 event; (iii) undergo a large-scale interchange instability the growth time of which is comparable to the ~ 0.2-s width of the initial hard transient phase of the March 5 event; (iv) confine the energy that was radiated in the soft tail of that burst; (v) reduce the Compton scattering cross-section sufficiently to generate a radiative flux that is ~ 104 times the (non-magnetic) Eddington flux; (vi) decay significantly in ~ 104–105 yr, as is required to explain the activity of soft gamma repeater sources on this time-scale; and (vii) power the quiescent X-ray emission LX ~ 7 × 1035 erg s–1 observed by Einstein and ROSAT as it diffuses the stellar interior.We propose that the 1979 March 5 event was triggered by a large-scale reconnection/interchange instability of the stellar magnetic field, and the soft repeat bursts by cracking of the crust. The hard initial spike of the March 5 event is identified with an expanding pair fireball, and the soft tail of that burst, together with the short, soft repeat bursts, with a pair plasma trapped in the stellar magnetosphere. We construct a detailed radiative model that describes the cooling of such a plasma. The opacity is dominated by the electron–baryon contaminant in a cold surface layer, and the plasma releases energy as the edge of the pair-dominated region propagates inward, in a cooling wave. The rate at which the plasma volume contracts is limited either by the rate of advection of heat toward the stellar surface (where the field is strongest and the scattering opacity weakest), or by ablation of ions and electrons from the stellar surface.The effective temperature of the surface radiation depends only on the surface magnetic field strength in the regime where the radiative flux is limited by ablation from the neutron star surface (which is the regime of interest in the March 5 event), and otherwise is weakly dependent on the plasma energy density. We argue that the deposition of equivalent energy in a much weaker magnetic field (characteristic of ordinary pulsars) necessarily generates a very high scattering depth which chokes off the radiative flow on the observed ~ 0.1-s time-scale of soft gamma repeater bursts. Indeed, we suggest that the same basic magnetospheric emission mechanism operates at lower field strengths (B ~ 1012 G) in Type II X-ray bursts, which have much lower luminosities than soft gamma repeater bursts.Important magnetic radiative effects include the suppression of Compton scattering in the extraordinary polarization mode, and stimulated photon splitting. We derive the Boltzmann equations for the photon occupation number which describe stimulated photon splitting, as well as photon merging. We show that the net splitting rate vanishes in thermal equilibrium. Radiative diffusion occurs primarily in the E-mode, although rapid scattering of the O-mode ensures convergence of the photon distribution function to a Bose–Einstein form. This allows us to write down diffusion equations for the photon energy flux and number flux as linear superpositions of gradients in the temperature and chemical potential. The transition from a Planck to a Bose–Einstein spectrum occurs at T ~ 10 keV. Photon splitting at higher temperatures can impede free-streaming of photons across the magnetic field lines, but splitting of high-energy photons is impeded by the inverse process of photon merging.We demonstrate that only a small fraction of the pair bubble energy can be conducted into the crust during the lifetime of the burst. We discuss the radiative ablation of matter from the heated stellar surface after the magnetospheric pair plasma is dissipated. The ensuing surface afterglow is typically ~ 1 per cent of the burst luminosity. Direct pair neutrino cooling of the plasma is shown to be unimportant for soft gamma repeater bursts, but may help to determine the light curve of the March 5 event. Finally, we make a critical comparison between this model and models in which the soft gamma repeater bursts are triggered by accretion and/or involve surface cooling.}",

	abstract = {We calculate the quiescent X-ray, neutrino, and Alfvén wave emission from a neutron star with a very strong magnetic field, Bdipole ~ 1014 − 1015 G and Binterior ~ (5–10) × 1015 G. These results are compared with observations of quiescent emission from the soft gamma repeaters and from a small class of anomalous X-ray pulsars that we have previously identified with such objects. The magnetic field, rather than rotation, provides the main source of free energy, and the decaying field is capable of powering the quiescent X-ray emission and particle emission observed from these sources. New features that are not present in the decay of the weaker fields associated with ordinary radio pulsars include fracturing of the neutron star crust, strong heating of its core, and effective suppression of thermal conduction perpendicular to the magnetic field. As the magnetic field is forced through the crust by diffusive motions in the core, multiple small-scale fractures are excited, as well as a few large fractures that can power soft gamma repeater bursts. The decay rate of the core field is a very strong function of temperature and therefore of the magnetic flux density. The strongest prediction of the model is that these sources will show no optical emissions associated with X-ray heating of an accretion disk.}

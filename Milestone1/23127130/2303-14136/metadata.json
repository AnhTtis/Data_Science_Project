    "abstract": "In this work, we have developed an FLRW type model of a universe which displays transition from deceleration in the past to the acceleration at the present. For this, we have considered field equations of $f(R,T)$ gravity and have taken $f(R,T) = R + 2 λT$, $λ$ being an arbitrary constant. We have estimated the $λ$ parameter in such a way that the transition red shift is found similar in the deceleration parameter, pressure and the equation of state parameter $ω$. The present value of Hubble parameter is estimated on the basis of the three types of observational data set: latest compilation of $46$ Hubble data set, SNe Ia $580$ data sets of distance modulus and $66$ Pantheon data set of apparent magnitude which comprised of 40 SN Ia binned and 26 high redshift data's in the range $0.014 \\leq z \\leq 2.26 $. These data are compared with theoretical results through the $ χ^2 $ statistical test. Interestingly, the model satisfies all the three weak, strong and dominant energy conditions. The model fits well with observational findings. We have discussed some of the physical aspects of the model, in particular the age of the universe.",

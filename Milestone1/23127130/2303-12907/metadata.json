    "abstract": "The upcoming NASA mission HelioSwarm will use nine spacecraft to make the first simultaneous multi-point measurements of space plasmas spanning multiple scales. Using the wave-telescope technique, HelioSwarm's measurements will allow for both the calculation of the power in wavevector-and-frequency space and the characterization of the associated dispersion relations of waves present in the plasma at MHD and ion-kinetic scales. This technique has been applied to the four-spacecraft missions of CLUSTER and MMS and its effectiveness has previously been characterized in a handful of case studies. We expand this uncertainty quantification analysis to arbitrary configurations of four through nine spacecraft for three-dimensional plane waves. We use Bayesian inference to learn equations that approximate the error in reconstructing the wavevector as a function of relative wavevector magnitude, spacecraft configuration shape, and number of spacecraft. We demonstrate the application of these equations to data drawn from a nine-spacecraft configuration to both improve the accuracy of the technique, as well as expand the magnitudes of wavevectors that can be characterized.",

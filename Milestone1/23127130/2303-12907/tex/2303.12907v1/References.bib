HelioSwarm is a mission concept that will deploy multiple, co-orbiting satellites to use the solar wind as a natural laboratory for understanding the fundamental, universal process of plasma turbulence. The HelioSwarm transfer trajectory and science orbit use a lunar gravity assist to deliver the ESPA-class nodes attached to a large data transfer hub to a P/2 lunar resonant orbit. Once deployed in the science orbit, the free-flying, propulsive nodes use simple Cartesian relative motion patterns to establish baseline separations both along and across the solar wind flow direction.},

@article{Burch:2016,
   abstract = {Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS), a NASA four-spacecraft constellation mission launched on March 12, 2015, will investigate magnetic reconnection in the boundary regions of the Earth’s magnetosphere, particularly along its dayside boundary with the solar wind and the neutral sheet in the magnetic tail. The most important goal of MMS is to conduct a definitive experiment to determine what causes magnetic field lines to reconnect in a collisionless plasma. The significance of the MMS results will extend far beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere because reconnection is known to occur in interplanetary space and in the solar corona where it is responsible for solar flares and the disconnection events known as coronal mass ejections. Active research is also being conducted on reconnection in the laboratory and specifically in magnetic-confinement fusion devices in which it is a limiting factor in achieving and maintaining electron temperatures high enough to initiate fusion. Finally, reconnection is proposed as the cause of numerous phenomena throughout the universe such as comet-tail disconnection events, magnetar flares, supernova ejections, and dynamics of neutron-star accretion disks. The MMS mission design is focused on answering specific questions about reconnection at the Earth’s magnetosphere. The prime focus of the mission is on determining the kinetic processes occurring in the electron diffusion region that are responsible for reconnection and that determine how it is initiated; but the mission will also place that physics into the context of the broad spectrum of physical processes associated with reconnection. Connections to other disciplines such as solar physics, astrophysics, and laboratory plasma physics are expected to be made through theory and modeling as informed by the MMS results.},

abstract="The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission is the fifth NASA Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX), launched on February 17, 2007 to determine the trigger and large-scale evolution of substorms. The mission employs five identical micro-satellites (hereafter termed ``probes'') which line up along the Earth's magnetotail to track the motion of particles, plasma and waves from one point to another and for the first time resolve space--time ambiguities in key regions of the magnetosphere on a global scale. The probes are equipped with comprehensive in-situ particles and fields instruments that measure the thermal and super-thermal ions and electrons, and electromagnetic fields from DC to beyond the electron cyclotron frequency in the regions of interest. The primary goal of THEMIS, which drove the mission design, is to elucidate which magnetotail process is responsible for substorm onset at the region where substorm auroras map (∼10 RE): (i) a local disruption of the plasma sheet current (current disruption) or (ii) the interaction of the current sheet with the rapid influx of plasma emanating from reconnection at ∼25 RE. However, the probes also traverse the radiation belts and the dayside magnetosphere, allowing THEMIS to address additional baseline objectives, namely: how the radiation belts are energized on time scales of 2--4 hours during the recovery phase of storms, and how the pristine solar wind's interaction with upstream beams, waves and the bow shock affects Sun--Earth coupling. THEMIS's open data policy, platform-independent dataset, open-source analysis software, automated plotting and dissemination of data within hours of receipt, dedicated ground-based observatory network and strong links to ancillary space-based and ground-based programs. promote a grass-roots integration of relevant NASA, NSF and international assets in the context of an international Heliophysics Observatory over the next decade. The mission has demonstrated spacecraft and mission design strategies ideal for Constellation-class missions and its science is complementary to Cluster and MMS. THEMIS, the first NASA micro-satellite constellation, is a technological pathfinder for future Sun-Earth Connections missions and a stepping stone towards understanding Space Weather.",

Using the SIFS method, we find that the reconnection structure is an X line; while using the MITS and FOTE methods, we find it is a magnetic island (O line). We compare the efficiency and accuracy of these three methods and find that the most efficient and accurate approach to identify a reconnection event is FOTE. In both the guide and nonguide field reconnection regimes, the FOTE method is equally applicable. This study for the first time demonstrates the capability of FOTE in identifying magnetic reconnection events; it would be useful to the forthcoming Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.},

ABSTRACT={A major subset of solar–terrestrial relations, responsible, in particular, for the driver of space weather phenomena, is the interaction between the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind. As one of the most important modes of the solar–wind–magnetosphere interaction, magnetic reconnection regulates the energy transport and energy release in the solar–terrestrial relation. In situ measurements in the near-Earth space are crucial for understanding magnetic reconnection. Past and existing spacecraft constellation missions mainly focus on the measurement of reconnection on plasma kinetic-scales. Resolving the macro-scale and cross-scale aspects of magnetic reconnection is necessary for accurate assessment and predictions of its role in the context of space weather. Here, we propose the AME (self-Adaptive Magnetic reconnection Explorer) mission consisting of a cross-scale constellation of 12+ CubeSats and one mother satellite. Each CubeSat is equipped with instruments to measure magnetic fields and thermal plasma particles. With multiple CubeSats, the AME constellation is intended to make simultaneous measurements at multiple scales, capable of exploring cross-scale plasma processes ranging from kinetic scale to macro scale.}

   abstract = {The four Cluster spacecraft will enable simultaneous measurements of the vector magnetic field at the vertices of a tetrahedron. Methods for analysing such data include: a contour integral method for determining the electric current density (from × B) in fields varying on scales relatively large compared to the spacecraft separations, and which was coined the "curlometer" technique; a wave telescope technique which is most reliable where the field scale variations are comparable to the spacecraft separations; and a discon-tinuity analysis technique for cases where the field scale variations are much shorter than the spacecraft separations. Note that the Curlometer also provides an estimate of · B via Gauss's Theorem. The finite difference equations at the core of the curlometer technique can also be derived and efficiently solved by making use of barycentric coordinates. A collection of methods based on barycentric coordinates are fully described in Chapter 14. In the linear approximation, the barycentric estimates for × B and · B are identical to those defined by contour integrals (as they should be for mathematical consistency). For this reason, both forms are used here as a matter of mathematical convenience: to employ the computational efficiency of the barycentric equations for the statistical analysis , for instance. The resulting estimates of J and the divergence of B are subject to errors of which there are basically three types. The first relates to measurement uncertainties in B, and in the spatial configuration of the four spacecraft. The second relates to the linear interpolation which is made between the various measurement points. The third relates to the simultaneity of the measurements. Sections 14.3 and 14.4 present theoretical investigations of the first and second types of errors respectively. The influence of these errors on the accuracy of the estimate of J or · B is strongly related to the shape of the tetrahedron but also to the magnetic structure present. This, of course, is not known (at least explicitly) for measured data. Since the shape of this tetrahedron evolves along the mean trajectory of the 4 spacecraft, it is particularly important to 395},

   abstract = {In this study, we apply a new method - the first-order Taylor expansion (FOTE) - to find magnetic nulls and reconstruct magnetic field topology, in order to use it with the data from the forthcoming MMS mission. We compare this method with the previously used Poincare index (PI), and find that they are generally consistent, except that the PI method can only find a null inside the spacecraft (SC) tetrahedron, while the FOTE method can find a null both inside and outside the tetrahedron and also deduce its drift velocity. In addition, the FOTE method can (1) avoid limitations of the PI method such as data resolution, instrument uncertainty (Bz offset), and SC separation; (2) identify 3-D null types (A, B, As, and Bs) and determine whether these types can degenerate into 2-D (X and O); (3) reconstruct the magnetic field topology. We quantitatively test the accuracy of FOTE in positioning magnetic nulls and reconstructing field topology by using the data from 3-D kinetic simulations. The influences of SC separation (0.05~1 d<inf>i</inf>) and null-SC distance (0~1 d<inf>i</inf>) on the accuracy are both considered. We find that (1) for an isolated null, the method is accurate when the SC separation is smaller than 1 d<inf>i</inf>, and the null-SC distance is smaller than 0.25~0.5 d<inf>i</inf>; (2) for a null pair, the accuracy is same as in the isolated-null situation, except at the separator line, where the field is nonlinear. We define a parameter ξ-≡-|(-λ<inf>1</inf>-+-λ<inf>2</inf>-+-λ<inf>3</inf>-)|/|λ|<inf>max</inf> in terms of the eigenvalues (λ<inf>i</inf>) of the null to quantify the quality of our method - the smaller this parameter the better the results. Comparing to the previously used parameter (η≡|∇-·-B|/|∇-×-B|), ξ is more relevant for null identification. Using the new method, we reconstruct the magnetic field topology around a radial-type null and a spiral-type null, and find that the topologies are well consistent with those predicted in theory. We therefore suggest using this method to find magnetic nulls and reconstruct field topology with four-point measurements, particularly from Cluster and the forthcoming MMS mission. For the MMS mission, this null-finding algorithm can be used to trigger its burst-mode measurements. Key Points We develop a new method to find magnetic nulls and reconstruct field topology We quantitatively test this method, and compare it with the Poincare index This method is useful for MMS mission, particularly for triggering burst mode},

In order to do so, we generalize the wave telescope technique to use spherical waves instead of plane waves. The new tool determines the center of the wavefronts locally measured by the sensor array. This virtual source can be related with the position of the source generating the detected waves provided the wave propagation mode and medium properties are known. Moreover, the motion of the source region can be derived, as well as its basic geometrical characteristics. In this work we give the theoretical background for the new tool and examples of location analysis based on synthetic data.

ABSTRACT={Unlike the vast majority of astrophysical plasmas, the solar wind is accessible to spacecraft, which for decades have carried in-situ instruments for directly measuring its particles and fields. Though such measurements provide precise and detailed information, a single spacecraft on its own cannot disentangle spatial and temporal fluctuations. Even a modest constellation of in-situ spacecraft, though capable of characterizing fluctuations at one or more scales, cannot fully determine the plasma’s 3-D structure. We describe here a concept for a new mission, the Magnetic Topology Reconstruction Explorer (MagneToRE), that would comprise a large constellation of in-situ spacecraft and would, for the first time, enable 3-D maps to be reconstructed of the solar wind’s dynamic magnetic structure. Each of these nanosatellites would be based on the CubeSat form-factor and carry a compact fluxgate magnetometer. A larger spacecraft would deploy these smaller ones and also serve as their telemetry link to the ground and as a host for ancillary scientific instruments. Such an ambitious mission would be feasible under typical funding constraints thanks to advances in the miniaturization of spacecraft and instruments and breakthroughs in data science and machine learning.}

            Probabilistic programming allows for automatic Bayesian inference on user-defined probabilistic models. Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.

   abstract = {Abstract. The four Cluster spacecraft provide an excellent opportunity to study spatial structures in the magnetosphere and adjacent regions. Propagating waves are amongst the interesting structures and for the first time, Cluster will allow one to measure the wave vector of low-frequency fluctuations in a space plasma. Based on a generalized minimum variance analysis wave vector estimates will be determined in the terrestrial magnetosheath and the near-Earth solar wind. The virtue and weakness of the wave telescope technique used is discussed in detail.Key words.

   abstract = {Multipoint measurements are a powerful method in studying wavefields in space plasmas. The wave telescope technique is tested against magnetic field fluctuations in the terrestrial magnetosheath measured by the four Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft on a spatial scale of about 20 km. The dispersion relation diagram and the wave vector distribution are determined for the first time in the ion-kinetic range. Moreover, the dispersion relation diagram is determined in a proxy plasma rest frame by regarding the low-frequency dispersion relation as a Doppler relation and compensating for the apparent phase velocity. Fluctuations are highly compressible, and the wave vectors have an angle of about 60° from the mean magnetic field. We interpret that the measured fluctuations represent a kinetic-drift mirror mode in the magnetosheath which is dispersive and in a turbulent state accompanied by a sideband formation.},

   abstract = {Unambiguous determination of wavevectors (wavelengths and propagation directions) is one of the major challenges of space plasma observations, since conventional wave analysis methods for the single spacecraft data are limited to the time series data analysis and the wave properties are determined as a function of the frequencies in the spacecraft frame. The wave telescope technique overcomes the problem of wavevector determination by making extensive use of the multi-spacecraft interferometric data. The wave telescope techniques do not assume any wave mode or plasma mode, and is suited to testing for the wave and turbulence theories against the multi-spacecraft data. This article presents an updated report on the wave telescope technique on the basis of adaptive filtering (Capon's minimum variance projection), the construction of an estimator for the multi-point magnetic field data, the performance and limits in the wavevector analysis (aliasing and low-wavenumber behavior), the applications to the Cluster fluxgate magnetometer data (dispersion relations, phase velocity diagrams, propagation pattern, energy spectra, helicities, and higher-order statistics), and possible extensions of the technique.},

abstract = {Spherical Fibonacci point sets yield nearly uniform point distributions on the unit sphere S2 ⊂ R3. The forward generation of these point sets has been widely researched and is easy to implement, such that they have been used in various applications.Unfortunately, the lack of an efficient mapping from points on the unit sphere to their closest spherical Fibonacci point set neighbors rendered them impractical for a wide range of applications, especially in computer graphics. Therefore, we introduce an inverse mapping from points on the unit sphere which yields the nearest neighbor in an arbitrarily sized spherical Fibonacci point set in constant time, without requiring any precomputations or table lookups.We show how to implement this inverse mapping on GPUs while addressing arising floating point precision problems. Further, we demonstrate the use of this mapping and its variants, and show how to apply it to fast unit vector quantization. Finally, we illustrate the means by which to modify this inverse mapping for texture mapping with smooth filter kernels and showcase its use in the field of procedural modeling.},

abstract = {In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds a position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to an element in the middle of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.  Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making ��(log��) comparisons, where “n” is the number of elements in the array, the “O” is “Big O” notation, and ������ is the logarithm. Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search. There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables, that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can be used to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array.  There are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in computational geometry and in numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.},

    "abstract": "A balanced edge-coloring of the complete graph is an edge-coloring such that every vertex is incident to each color the same number of times. In this short note, we present a construction of a balanced edge-coloring with six colors of the complete graph on $n=13^k$ vertices, for every positive integer $k$, with no rainbow $K_4$. This solves a problem by Erdős and Tuza.",

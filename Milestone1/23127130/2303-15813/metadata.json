    "abstract": "Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composite (FRPC) parts are mostly made as laminates, shells, or surfaces wound with 2D fiber patterns even after the emergence of additive manufacturing. Making FRPC parts with embedded continuous fibers in 3D is not reported previously even though topology optimization shows that such designs are optimal. Earlier attempts in 3D fiber reinforcement have demonstrated additively manufactured parts with channels into which fibers are inserted. In this paper, we present 3D printing techniques along with a printer developed for printing parts with continuous fibers that are spatially embedded inside the matrix using a variant of vat photopolymerization. Multiple continuous fibers are gradually steered as the part is built layer upon layer instead of placing them inside channels made in the part. We show examples of spatial fiber patterns and geometries built using the 3D printing techniques developed in this work. We also test the parts for strength and illustrate the importance of spatially embedding fibers in specific patterns.",

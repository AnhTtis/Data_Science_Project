    "abstract": "We propose a novel Monte-Carlo based ab-initio algorithm for directly computing the statistics for quantities of interest in an immiscible two-phase compressible flow. Our algorithm samples the underlying probability space and evolves these samples with a sharp interface front-tracking scheme. Consequently, statistical information is generated without resorting to any closure assumptions and information about the underlying microstructure is implicitly included. The proposed algorithm is tested on a suite of numerical experiments and we observe that the ab-initio procedure can simulate a variety of flow regimes robustly and converges with respect of refinement of number of samples as well as number of bubbles per volume. The results are also compared with a state-of-the-art discrete equation method to reveal the inherent limitations of existing macroscopic models.",

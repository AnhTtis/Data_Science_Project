    "abstract": "A new effective field theory has been developed to describe shallow $P$-wave resonances using nonlocal, momentum-dependent two-body potentials. This approach is expected to facilitate many-body calculations and has been demonstrated to converge and to be renormalizable in perturbative calculations at subleading orders. The theory has been applied to the neutron-alpha system, with good agreement found between its predictions and a phase-shift analysis of neutron-alpha elastic scattering. In the three-body system consisting of two neutrons and an alpha particle, the nonlocal potential in this framework has been found to recover the same qualitative features as previously shown with energy-dependent formulations.",

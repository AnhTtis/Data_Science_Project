    "abstract": "Our research deals with the optimization version of the set partition problem, where the objective is to minimize the absolute difference between the sums of the two disjoint partitions. Although this problem is known to be NP-hard and requires exponential time to solve, we propose a less demanding version of this problem where the goal is to find a locally optimal solution. In our approach, we consider the local optimality in respect to any movement of at most two elements. To accomplish this, we developed an algorithm that can generate a locally optimal solution in at most $O(N^2)$ time and $O(N)$ space. Our algorithm can handle arbitrary input precisions and does not require positive or integer inputs. Hence, it can be applied in various problem scenarios with ease.",

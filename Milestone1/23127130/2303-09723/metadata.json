    "abstract": "Many authors studied the problem that rational triangle pairs (triangle-parallelogram pairs) with the same area and the same perimeter. They investigated this problem by solving the rational solutions of the corresponding Diophantine equations. In this paper, we give a unified description of this problem by using the affine transformation in a rectangular coordinate system. According to the fact that two triangles with the same area and the same perimeter determine an affine transformation, this problem can be reduced to solving a specific Diophantine system. Moreover, we will give some rational solutions to this Diophantine system.",

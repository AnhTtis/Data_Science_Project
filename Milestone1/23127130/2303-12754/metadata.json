    "abstract": "LoRa low-power wide-area network protocol has recently gained attention for deploying ad-hoc search and rescue (SaR) systems. They could be empowered by exploiting body-UAV links that enable communications between a body-worn radio and a UAV-mounted one. However, to employ UAVs effectively, knowledge of the signal's propagation in the environment is required. Otherwise, communications and localization could be hindered. The radio range, the packet delivery ratio (PDR), and the large- and small-scale fading of body-UAV LoRa links at 868 MHz when the radio wearer is in a Mediterranean forest are here characterized for the first time with a near-ground UAV having a maximum flying height of 30 m. A log-distance model accounting for the body shadowing and the wearer's movements is derived. Over the full LoRa radio range of about 600 m, the new model predicts the path loss (PL) better than the state-of-the-art ones, with a reduction of the median error even by 10 dB. The observed small-scale fading is severe and follows a Nakagami-m distribution. Extensions of the model for similar scenarios can be drawn through appropriate corrective factors.",

In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}}

abstract  ="The organic electrolyte of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in the aprotic solvent of acetonitrile (ACN) is widely used in electrochemical systems such as electrochemical capacitors. In this paper{,} we examine the solvation of TEA+ and BF4− in ACN{,} and the structure{,} capacitance{,} and dynamics of the electrical double layers (EDLs) in the TEABF4–ACN electrolyte using molecular dynamics simulations complemented with quantum density functional theory calculations. The solvation of TEA+ and BF4− ions is found to be much weaker than that of small inorganic ions in aqueous solutions{,} and the ACN molecules in the solvation shell of both types of ions show only weak packing and orientational ordering. These solvation characteristics are caused by the large size{,} charge delocalization{,} and irregular shape (in the case of TEA+ cation) of the ions. Near neutral electrodes{,} the double-layer structure in the organic electrolyte exhibits a rich organization: the solvent shows strong layering and orientational ordering{,} ions are significantly contact-adsorbed on the electrode{,} and alternating layers of cations/anions penetrate ca. 1.1 nm into the bulk electrolyte. The significant contact adsorption of ions and the alternating layering of cation/anion are new features found for EDLs in organic electrolytes. These features essentially originate from the fact that van der Waals interactions between organic ions and the electrode are strong and the partial desolvation of these ions occurs easily{,} as a result of the large size of the organic ions. Near charged electrodes{,} distinct counter-ion concentration peaks form{,} and the ion distribution cannot be described by the Helmholtz model or the Helmholtz + Poisson–Boltzmann model. This is because the number of counter-ions adsorbed on the electrode exceeds the number of electrons on the electrode{,} and the electrode is over-screened in parts of the EDL. The computed capacitances of the EDLs are in good agreement with that inferred from experimental measurements. Both the rotations (ACN only) and translations of interfacial ACN and ions are found to slow down as the electrode is electrified. We also observe an asymmetrical dependence of these motions on the sign of the electrode charge. The rotation/diffusion of ACN and the diffusion of ions in the region beyond the first ACN or ion layer differ only weakly from those in the bulk."}

abstract={Solid-state batteries possess the potential to significantly impact energy storage industries by enabling diverse benefits, such as increased safety and energy density. However, challenges persist with physicochemical properties and processes at electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Thus, there is great need to characterize such interfaces in situ, and unveil scientific understanding that catalyzes engineering solutions. To address this, we conduct multiscale in situ microscopies (optical, atomic force, and infrared near-field) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies (near-field nanospectroscopy and attenuated total reflection) of intact and electrochemically operational graphene/solid polymer electrolyte interfaces. We find nanoscale structural and chemical heterogeneities intrinsic to the solid polymer electrolyte initiate a cascade of additional interfacial nanoscale heterogeneities during Li plating and stripping; including Li-ion conductivity, electrolyte decomposition, and interphase formation. Moreover, our methodology to nondestructively characterize buried interfaces and interphases in their native environment with nanoscale resolution is readily adaptable to a number of other electrochemical systems and battery chemistries.},

abstract = {The molecular structure of the electrical double layer determines the chemistry in all electrochemical processes. Using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we probed the structure of water near gold electrodes and its bias dependence. Electron yield XAS detected at the gold electrode revealed that the interfacial water molecules have a different structure from those in the bulk. First principles calculations revealed that ~50\% of the molecules lie flat on the surface with saturated hydrogen bonds and another substantial fraction with broken hydrogen bonds that do not contribute to the XAS spectrum because their core-excited states are delocalized by coupling with the gold substrate. At negative bias, the population of flat-lying molecules with broken hydrogen bonds increases, producing a spectrum similar to that of bulk water. The water double-layer structure at an electrode changed from ordered to disordered when the applied bias was switched. The structure of water within a nanometer of an electrode surface is known as the electrical double layer. This layer creates a strong electrical field that can affect electrochemical reactions. Velasco-Velez et al. explored the structure of the electrical double layer at a bare gold electrode. With no applied potential and at positive potentials, the layer is highly structured (resembling ice) with few dangling hydrogen bonds. However, at negative potentials, the layer was more like bulk water, and half of the water molecules lie flat on the surface. Science, this issue p. 831}}

abstract = {Abstract Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files.

A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.}}

abstract = {Summary
The need for energy storage technologies that meet the demands for safety, sustainability, and high energy density has spurred increased interests in rechargeable Mg batteries. However, verification of their potential remains hampered by the absence of practical components. Recently, an unconventional research direction that deviates from the mainstream path has emerged and is redefining the boundaries of what can be accomplished in Mg batteries. Herein, we analyze this direction with a focus on fundamental phenomena with an aim to reveal new opportunities that can overcome long-standing challenges and unveil unaddressed issues. The topics covered encompass: (1) realizing efficient single salt Mg electrolytes that mimic those used in typical Li- and Na-ion batteries, (2) discovery of important concomitant mechanisms and previously unanticipated interfacial phenomena, and (3) identification of often overlooked bottlenecks in Mg cathodes and alternative anodes. In closing, we put forward our proposal for R&D focuses to help realize practical Mg batteries.}}

abstract = {Abstract The development of high energy density battery technologies based on divalent metals as the negative electrode is very appealing. Ca and Mg are especially interesting choices due to their combination of low standard reduction potential and natural abundance. One particular problem stalling the technological development of these batteries is the low efficiency of plating/stripping at the negative electrode, which relates to several factors that have not yet been looked at systematically; the nature/concentration of the electrolyte, which determines the mass transport of electro-active species (cation complexes) toward the electrode; the possible presence of passivation layers, which may hinder ionic transport and hence limit electrodeposition; and the mechanisms behind the charge transfer leading to nucleation/growth of the metal. Different electrolytes are investigated for Mg and Ca, with the presence/absence of chlorides in the formulation playing a crucial role in the cation desolvation. From a R\&D point-of-view, proper characterization alongside modeling is crucial to understand the phenomena determining the mechanisms of the plating/stripping processes. The state-of-the-art is here presented together with a short perspective on the influence of the cation solvation also on the positive electrode and finally an attempt to define guidelines for future research in the field.},

abstract = {The development of Ca conducting electrolytes is key to enable functional rechargeable Ca batteries. The here presented screening strategy is initially based on a combined density functional theory (DFT) and conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) approach, which allows for a rational selection of electrolyte solvent based on a set of physico-chemical and electrochemical properties: solvation power, electrochemical stability window, viscosity, and flash and boiling points. Starting from 81 solvents, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was chosen as solvent for further studies of cation-solvent interactions and subsequent comparisons vs. cation-anion interactions possibly present in electrolytes, based on a limited set of Ca-salts. A Ca2+ first solvation shell of [Ca(DMF)8]2+ was found to be energetically preferred, even as compared to ion-pairs and aggregates, especially for PF6− and TFSI as the anions. Overall, this points to Ca(TFSI)2 and Ca(PF6)2 dissolved in DMF to be a promising base electrolyte for Ca batteries from a physico-chemical point-of-view. While electrochemical assessments certainly are needed to verify this promise, the screening strategy presented is efficient and a useful stepping-stone to reduce the overall R&D effort.}

abstract = {Abstract Calcium-metal batteries have received growing attention recently after several studies reporting successful metal plating and stripping with organic electrolytes. Given the low redox potential of metallic calcium, its surface is commonly covered by a passivation layer grown by the accumulation of electrolyte decomposition products. The presence of borate species in this layer has been shown to be a key parameter allowing for Ca2+ migration and favoring Ca electrodeposition. Here, boron-based additives are evaluated in order to tune the SEI composition, morphology, and properties. The decomposition of a BF3-based additive is studied at different potentiostatic steps and the resulting SEI layer was thoroughly characterized. SEI growth mechanism is proposed based on both experimental data and DFT calculations pointing at the formation of boron-crosslinked polymeric matrices. Several boron-based adducts are explored as SEI-forming additives for calcium-metal batteries paving the way to very rich chemistry leading to Ca2+ conducting SEI.},

This review aims to provide a timely access to the state-of-art advance in anode chemistry of CIBs. Firstly, an overview on the development history of CIBs is presented. Then, a comprehensive understanding on the challenges facing CIBs is elaborated. The advancements on the development of appropriate salts and electrolytes to achieve highly reversible plating/stripping of calcium metal anode are systematically discussed. As alternative to metallic calcium anode, suitable anode candidates for hosting calcium ions are summarized, including alloying, intercalation, and organic electrodes systems. Finally, critical challenges for metallic calcium and alternative anode materials are envisioned, followed by their important future directions for the development and application in CIBs.}

However, it is unknown whether Al3+ can be reversibly stored in the lattice of the host electrode material because of its small cation diameter and high valence state, thus trapping it tightly in lattice or defect sites. Here, we report the reversible storage of Al3+ in V2O5 nanowires. It is found that Al3+ intercalates into crystalized V2O5 nanowires in the first discharge. Meanwhile, this electrochemical intercalation leads to the reduction of V5+ and the formation of an amorphous layer on the edge of nanowires. In the subsequent cycling, a new phase forms along the nanowires’ edges and a two-phase transition reaction occurs. Our findings demonstrate clearly for the first time that it is possible that Al3+ can be inserted into the metal oxide and stored reversibly through intercalation and a phase-transition reaction, which is expected to inspire more comprehensive investigations for rechargeable aluminum batteries.}

abstract = {Divalent rechargeable metal batteries such as those based on magnesium and calcium are of interest because of the abundance of these elements and their lower tendency to form dendrites, but practical demonstrations are lacking. Hou et al. used methoxyethyl amine chelants in which the ligands attach to the metal atom in more than one place, modulating the solvation structure of the metal ions to enable a facile charge-transfer reaction (see the Perspective by Zuo and Yin). In full battery cells, these components lead to high efficiency and energy density. Theoretical calculations were used to understand the solvation structures. —MSL Chelating ligands promote fast charge-transfer kinetics for Mg and Ca batteries with substantially lowered overpotentials. Rechargeable magnesium and calcium metal batteries (RMBs and RCBs) are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries because of the high crustal abundance and capacity of magnesium and calcium. Yet, they are plagued by sluggish kinetics and parasitic reactions. We found a family of methoxyethyl-amine chelants that greatly promote interfacial charge transfer kinetics and suppress side reactions on both the cathode and metal anode through solvation sheath reorganization, thus enabling stable and highly reversible cycling of the RMB and RCB full cells with energy densities of 412 and 471 watt-hours per kilogram, respectively. This work provides a versatile electrolyte design strategy for divalent metal batteries.}}

All three components significantly influence electrochemical characteristics and energy density of rechargeable magnesium batteries. Although there are many reports showing progress in the cyclability and stability of different systems, only few cathode materials promise possible commercialization. Remaining issues with efficiency, magnesium anode processing and electrolyte compatibility with cell housing are preventing faster development of technology with high possible impact on the future battery landscape. In the given perspective paper a critical overview on electrolytes, anode materials and three different classes of cathode materials is reported. Different rechargeable magnesium battery configurations were assumed and their dependence of volumetric energy densities on gravimetric energy densities are provided assuming realistic conditions with optimized electrode thicknesses and loadings, electrode porosity and optimized electrolyte quantity.

For solution-grown crystals, desolvation at kink sites can be the rate-limiting step for growth. However, desolvation and the associated kinetic barriers are poorly understood. In this work, we use rare-event simulation techniques to investigate attachment/detachment events at kink sites of a NaCl crystal in water. We elucidate the desolvation mechanism and present an optimized reaction coordinate, which involves one solute collective variable and one solvent collective variable. The attachment/detachment pathways for Na+ and Cl− are qualitatively similar, with quantitative differences that we attribute to different ion sizes and solvent coordination. The attachment barriers primarily result from kink site desolvation, while detachment barriers largely result from breaking ion–crystal bonds. We compute ion detachment rates from kink sites and compare with results from an independent study. We anticipate that the reaction coordinate and desolvation mechanism identified in this work may be applicable to other alkali halides.}}

	abstract = {Ca-ion electrochemical systems have been pushed to the forefront of recent multivalent energy storage advances due to their use of earth-abundant redox materials and their high theoretical specific densities in relation to monovalent or even other more widely explored multivalent-charge carriers. However, significant pitfalls in metal plating and stripping arise from electrolyte decomposition and can be related to the coordination environment around Ca2+ with both the negatively charged anion and the organic–aprotic solvent. In this study, we apply multiple spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with density functional theory to evaluate the coordination environment of Ca2+ across a class of ethereal solvents. Through the combination of X-ray absorption fine structure and time-dependent density functional theory, descriptive measures of the local geometry, coordination, and electronic structure of Ca–ethereal complexes provide distinct structural trends depending on the extent of the Ca2+–solvent interaction. Finally, we correlate these findings with electrochemical measurements of calcium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropoxy)borate (CaBHFIP2) salts dissolved within this class of solvents to provide insight into the preferred structural configuration of Ca2+ electrolytic solutions for optimized electrochemical plating and stripping.}}

abstract  ="Development of calcium metal batteries has been historically frustrated by a lack of electrolytes capable of supporting reversible calcium electrodeposition. In this paper{,} we report the study of an electrolyte consisting of Ca(BH4)2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to gain important insight into the role of the liquid solvation environment in facilitating the reversible electrodeposition of this highly reactive{,} divalent metal. Through interrogation of the Ca2+ solvation environment and comparison with Mg2+ analogs{,} we show that an ability to reversibly electrodeposit metal at reasonable rates is strongly regulated by dication charge density and polarizability. Our results indicate that the greater polarizability of Ca2+ over Mg2+ confers greater configurational flexibility{,} enabling ionic cluster formation via neutral multimer intermediates. Increased concentration of the proposed electroactive species{,} CaBH4+{,} enables rapid and stable delivery of Ca2+ to the electrode interface.

abstract = {Abstract Calcium-metal batteries (CMBs) provide a promising option for high-energy and cost-effective energy-storage technology beyond the current state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the development of room-temperature CMBs is significantly impeded by the poor reversibility and short lifespan of the calcium-metal anode. A solvation manipulation strategy is reported to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of calcium-metal anodes by enhancing the desolvation kinetics of calcium ions in the electrolyte. The introduction of lithium salt changes the electrolyte structure considerably by reducing coordination number of calcium ions in the first solvation shell. As a result, an unprecedented Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.1 \% is achieved for galvanostatic plating/stripping of the calcium-metal anode, accompanied by a very stable long-term cycling performance over 200 cycles at room temperature. This work may open up new opportunities for development of practical CMBs.},

abstract = {Abstract Herein, graphite is proposed as a reliable Ca2+-intercalation anode in tetraglyme (G4). When charged (reduced), graphite accommodates solvated Ca2+-ions (Ca-G4) and delivers a reversible capacity of 62 mAh g−1 that signifies the formation of a ternary intercalation compound, Ca-G4·C72. Mass/volume changes during Ca-G4 intercalation and the evolution of in operando X-ray diffraction studies both suggest that Ca-G4 intercalation results in the formation of an intermediate phase between stage-III and stage-II with a gallery height of 11.41 Å. Density functional theory calculations also reveal that the most stable conformation of Ca-G4 has a planar structure with Ca2+ surrounded by G4, which eventually forms a double stack that aligns with graphene layers after intercalation. Despite large dimensional changes during charge/discharge (C/D), both rate performance and cyclic stability are excellent. Graphite retains a substantial capacity at high C/D rates (e.g., 47 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 s vs 62 mAh g−1 at 0.05 A g−1) and shows no capacity decay during as many as 2000 C/D cycles. As the first Ca2+-shuttling calcium-ion batteries with a graphite anode, a full-cell is constructed by coupling with an organic cathode and its electrochemical performance is presented.},

ABSTRACT={In the field of secondary batteries, the growing diversity of possible applications for energy storage has led to the investigation of numerous alternative systems to the state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery. Metal-air batteries are one such technology, due to promising specific energies that could reach beyond the theoretical maximum of lithium-ion. Much focus over the past decade has been on lithium and sodium-air, and, only in recent years, efforts have been stepped up in the study of divalent metal-air batteries. Within this article, the opportunities, progress, and challenges in nonaqueous rechargeable magnesium and calcium-air batteries will be examined and critically reviewed. In particular, attention will be focused on the electrolyte development for reversible metal deposition and the positive electrode chemistries (frequently referred to as the “air cathode”). Synergies between two cell chemistries will be described, along with the present impediments required to be overcome. Scientific advances in understanding fundamental cell (electro)chemistry and electrolyte development are crucial to surmount these barriers in order to edge these technologies toward practical application.}

While the Ca anode is often described as being surface film-controlled, the ability to access reversible Ca electrochemistry is highly electrolyte-dependent in general, which affects both interfacial chemistry on plated Ca along with more fundamental Ca2+/Ca redox properties. This minireview describes recent progress towards a reversible Ca anode from the point of view of the most successful electrolyte chemistries identified to date. This includes, centrally, what is currently known about the Ca2+ solvation environment in these systems. Experimental (physico-chemical and spectroscopy) and computational results are summarized for the two major solvent classes – carbonates and ethers – that have yielded promising results so far. Current knowledge gaps and opportunities to improve fundamental understanding of Ca2+/Ca redox are also identified.},

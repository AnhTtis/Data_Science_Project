\begin{abstract}
Divalent ions (Mg, Ca, and Zn) are being considered as competitive, safe, and earth-abundant alternatives to Li-ion electrochemistry, but present challenges for stable cycling due to undesirable interfacial phenomena. We explore the formation of electroactive species in the electrolyte Ca(BH$_4$)$_2$$|$THF using molecular dynamics coupled with a continuum model of bulk and interfacial speciation. Free-energy analysis and unsupervised learning indicate a majority population of neutral Ca dimers and monomers with diverse molecular conformations and an order of magnitude lower concentration of the primary electroactive charged species -- the monocation, CaBH$_4^+$ -- produced via disproportionation of neutral complexes. Dense layering of THF molecules within $\sim$~1~nm of the electrode surface strongly modulates local electrolyte species populations. A dramatic increase in monocation population in this interfacial zone is induced at negative bias. We see no evidence for electrochemical activity of fully-solvated Ca$^{2+}$. The consequences for performance are discussed in light of this molecular-scale insight.

\section*{Introduction}

To increase the rate of conversion to renewable energy sources, electrification of various energy-intensive aspects of society is underway. The concomitant demand for electrochemical energy storage solutions increasingly highlights the limits of Li-ion technologies with respect to performance, safety and sustainability. Multivalent ions such as Mg$^{2+}$, Ca$^{2+}$, Zn$^{2+}$, or even Al$^{3+}$, offer more earth-abundant alternatives, some with higher theoretical specific capacity and reduced safety concerns due to self-passivation of metal anodes.~\cite{Dong2020, Mohtadi2021, Lv2022, GuWu2017, Arroyo-deDompablo2020} 

However, realizing performant electrochemical cells using these ions is hindered due to various issues driven by interfacial phenomena:  low power output and charging rates due to large overpotentials and associated electrolyte decomposition and interphase growth.{~\cite{McClary2022, Liang2020,Deng2022,LeeYu2023,Hosein2021}} At issue is our lack of understanding of the specific complex nature of solvation in suitable electrolytes for multivalent ions and the identification of which of these species are active at the electrode-electrolyte interface and why.~\cite{forer-saboya2022} We may be biased by familiarity with aqueous solutions and the ability of water to generate perfect electrolytes, with fully dissociated and solvated ions, for many salts. However, organic solvents (required for a sufficiently wide window of electrochemical stability in batteries), with typically lower dielectric constants and larger molecular sizes, have increased residence times for coordinating highly charged cations and have relatively little interaction with anions, unlike ambipolar water molecules which more easily solvate both charges.

Molecular dynamics provides a window to the inner workings of electrolytes, revealing details of coordination of cations by solvent molecules and anions.{~\cite{YaoZhang2022, ChenZhang2020}} However, in the study of highly-charged species in poor dielectrics, we must take care to avoid sampling only a limited set of coordination states due to their long lifetimes and unavoidable limitations in computing time and complexity. Free-energy sampling allows us the opportunity to pose fundamental questions regarding the chemical composition of a poor electrolyte and the mechanisms by which its solvated species interconvert.~\cite{Roy2016, Baer2016, Joswiak2018, Baskin2019, baskin2020, Silvestri2022} Mining the large quantities of compositional and conformational data produced by these simulations presents its own challenge. Here we rely on recently developed unsupervised learning approaches~\cite{Roncoroni2023} to provide a faster path to extracting molecular-scale insight and guidance for future experiments to validate our predictions.

Calcium is a competitive multivalent candidate largely because its redox potential is just 0.2~V above Li (lower than Mg, Zn or Al). Despite decades of research,{~\cite{WeiLiu2022}} only in 2016 was reversible plating and stripping on calcium metal achieved.{~\cite{Ponrouch2016}} Room-temperature reversibility followed swiftly, in 2018, using Ca/BH$_4^-$/THF.{~\cite{Wang2018}}
Hydride-terminated anions such as BH$_4^-$   offer high efficiency without significant passivation{~\cite{Wang2018}} partly due to solvent and salt stability against the anode{~\cite{Liepinya2021}} in comparison with typical Li-ion salts and solvents.{~\cite{WangCheng2018}}  Newer, more complex, hydride-borane based electrolytes, such as carba-closoborane in mixed solvents (DME/THF),{~\cite{Kisu2021}} with similar performance and reversibility, exhibit a wider electrochemical stability window and have recently shown good long-term operation characteristics.{~\cite{Kisu2023}} This promise makes it even more important to understand the key aspects of hydride-based{~\cite{Hahn2023}} anion electrolytes. Hence, we study Ca(BH$_4$)$_2$ in THF as a promising electrolyte candidate  for room-temperature, reversible calcium deposition  with best-in-class efficiency and minimum parasitic reactions -- with complex bulk and largely unknown interfacial solvation environments.{~\cite{Wang2018, hahn2020, jieTan202, Liepinya2021, ta2019, melemed2020, McClary2022, YangTrahey2023, Melemed2022, Melemed_Oct2023}}

 We can also contrast its behavior with Mg(TFSI)$_2$ in THF, studied recently using free energy sampling.{~\cite{baskin2021}} Recent investigations of the complexation in the bulk electrolyte{~\cite{hahn2020, Hahn2021}} detected Ca-dimers  (Ca$_2$(BH$_4$)$_4$) experimentally. Dimers were suggested to facilitate the disproportionation of neutral monomers  into anions Ca(BH$_4$)$_3^-$ and monocations CaBH$_4^+$, proposed to be the main electroactive species:


\begin{align}
       \ce{ 2 Ca(BH4)2 & <=>  Ca2(BH4)4 <=>}\nonumber \\
    \ce{&CaBH4^{+} + Ca(BH4)3^{-}}   \label{eq:dimer_eq}
\end{align}


In the same work, molecular cluster calculations (embedded in a polarizable continuum model) indicated that the dimer is the second most stable conformation after the neutral monomer, but lacked specific solvent interactions beyond the first coordination shell and any Debye screening from finite ion concentrations.

Interfacial characterization reveals the ready formation of solid-electrolyte interphases incorporating oxidized boron and even embedded calcium hydride.~\cite{McClary2022} And debate continues as to the presence or electrochemical relevance of the fully-solvated Ca$^{2+}$ dication.{~\cite{Wang2018, ta2019,melemed2020, jieTan202, Liepinya2021, rev-Lu2021, Hahn2023}}

In this work, we reveal intricate details of the population of species in the bulk of this electrolyte and striking differences within a nanometer of its electrode interfaces, which are further exaggerated by negative potential differences. We discuss the consequences of these predictions for functioning cells.


\section*{Results}

\subsection*{In the bulk electrolyte}

We employ free-energy analysis for a model of the bulk electrolyte at room temperature (RT), comprising two Ca$^{2+}$ ions (and four borohydride anions) dissolved in THF (Fig.~1 a), using empirical force fields (see Methods and Supporting Information). The free energy surface (Fig.~1 b) is sampled using metadynamics~\cite{Laio2002} with respect to two collective variables: the Ca-B coordination number, which controls the charge of complexes, and the Ca-Ca distance, which for a system with only two Ca ions, distinguishes between monomers and dimers.

This projection of the free energy landscape indicates a preference for dimer formation in competition with the entropy gains associated with free monomers. From analysis of our molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, Ca-Ca dimers are neutral complexes with the formula Ca$_2$(BH$_4$)$_4$ and come in two varieties: long dimers (63\%) bridged by a single BH$_4^-$ and short dimers (37\%) bridged by two anions (see below for more detail). 
Sampling local minima in the free energy surface allows us to parametrize a continuum model for chemical equilibration at finite concentration that includes a model of configurational entropy{~\cite{Wu2018, Baskin_2017, Baskin_2019_JCP}}, as shown in Fig.~1(c). In what follows, we will make explicit comparisons between the moderate (0.12 M) effective concentration of our MD simulations and a high concentration (1.65 M, close to saturation) which led to improved electrochemical performance in experiment.{~\cite{hahn2020, Hahn2021, YangTrahey2023}} 
The relative population of Ca-Ca dimers increases with concentration and is the most favored species above 2~M (although this is likely above the solubility limit). 
Conversely, the population of the neutral monomer complex, Ca(BH$_4$)$_2$, decreases with concentration. This might be expected from the perspective of solvent entropy -- the need to coordinate more dissolved species at higher concentrations, which reduces entropy, can be somewhat offset by the formation of solute oligomers, such as contact ion complexes, dimers, etc. which require less solvent coordination.

It is notable that only a small percentage of the solvated population is predicted to be charged ($<$2\% at low concentrations), dominated by the monocation, CaBH$_4^+$, with its complementary anion, Ca(BH$_4$)$_3^-$. Both bulk populations decrease with concentration. The free energy for the formation of fully solvated dications, Ca$^{2+}$, in this model, is too high ($\sim$19~kT) to support a significant bulk population at any concentration. These results provide some reordering with respect to static estimates which predict the neutral monomer as most favorable, followed by a single (short) dimer conformation, the monocation and the anion.~\cite{hahn2020} From the relative populations of each species, it is clear that neglecting the long dimer would lead to this conclusion. Furthermore, it is clear from RT sampling that there are multiple possible conformations for the dimer at finite temperature (as we explore below). However, both sets of calculations agree that the fully solvated dication Ca$^{2+}$ is the least favored in this set of possibilities (1-1.2~eV higher in energy by static estimates~\cite{hahn2020}, 0.48~eV from free-energy sampling at RT  at an effective concentration of 0.12 M).  

Our 2D free energy surface (Fig.~1 b) reveals that direct interconversion of these solvated objects, by removal or addition of borohydride anions, is prevented by quite steep free energy barriers (24.4~kT or $\sim$0.6~eV). The easier path to disproportionation (forming charged species from neutral monomers) is through the formation of dimers, with exchange of borohydride anions before dissociation into the complex monocation and anion as per Eq.~1 (with activation energies of 2.4 - 10~kT, Fig.~1 b and Fig.~S1).

At a minimum, this explains the prevalence of dimers in spectroscopic analysis of the bulk electrolyte (using EXAFS and Raman spectroscopy)\cite{hahn2020} and possibly the observation of saturating ionic conductivity with increasing concentration as more neutral dimers form (prior to precipitation, Fig.~1(c)).~\cite{hahn2020,Hahn2021} 

The predicted concentration-dependence of neutral species is in great agreement with experimental reports;{~\cite{Hahn2021}} and although we obtain a similar order of magnitude for the monocation, our results indicate that the monocation population actually decreases with concentration, opposite to experimental results. However, as we will see below, bulk concentrations of charged species may have little to do with the electrochemical performance which is dominated by interfacial phenomena.

Strikingly, we find that bulk populations of each complex are conformationally quite diverse. Our metadynamics simulations project the full free energy landscape onto only a few collective variables, however, multiple molecular conformations may satisfy these constraints (Ca-B coordination number and Ca-Ca distance, in this case).
Data-mining techniques (dimensionality reduction, hierarchical clustering and permutation-invariant alignment~\cite{Roncoroni2023} -- details in Methods and SI) applied to selective umbrella sampling of local minima in the free energy landscape reveal a rich variety of solvated isomeric structures, summarized in Fig.~1 d. 

For example, the neutral monomer, Ca(BH$_4$)$_2$, when additionally coordinated by three THF molecules ($\sim$~60\% of its population) adopts mostly bent borohydride arrangements with a large dipole moment ($\sim$8 Debye, see  Fig.~1 d, isomer 3 THF - 1 and SI Section 1). In addition, we found a significant portion ($\sim$~30\%) of monomers coordinated by 4 THF molecules with an axial borohydride arrangement and low dipole moment ($\sim$2 Debye, see Fig.~1 d, isomer 4 THF - 2)). These two structures had been proposed separately as the minimum energy structure from quantum-chemical cluster calculations~\cite{hahn2020} and molecular dynamics simulations,~\cite{Hahn2021} respectively.  By contrast, the monocation occurs mostly with 5 coordinating THF molecules (see below), in agreement with previous reports.\cite{hahn2020}

We find that dimers are always neutral (with four borohydride anions) and are split in two main spatial configurations characterized as short (SD) and long (LD) dimers with average Ca-Ca equilibrium distances of 4.48 and 5.25~\AA{}, respectively (Fig.~S2). Furthermore, each was found to have sub-populations with 4-7 solvent molecules, and, within those, several stereoisomers (Fig.~1 d). Key differences between the long and short dimers are the presence of a single-anion or double-anion bridge and predominant 6 THF coordination or mixed 5-6 THF coordination, respectively. Short dimers are in excellent agreement with a previously proposed double-bridged dimer structure with a 4.4~\AA{} Ca-Ca distance (from fitting to EXAFS  data).~\cite{hahn2020}
The set of structures shown here expands upon and underscores the configurational flexibility of calcium.~\cite{hahn2020}
And, based on our understanding of the efficient disproportionation pathways to form charged species  via dimerization (discussed above), it makes sense that the dominant dimer conformations form from combinations of bent and axial borohydride arrangements of the neutral monomers (e.g., long dimer isomers 1, 3 and 7 with 6 THF molecules in Fig.~1 d are bent-bent, axial-bent and axial-bent combinations, respectively).

Although all dimers here are neutral, each Ca ion within a given dimer may be locally coordinated by 1 to 4 anions, with 1 (long) or 2 (short) shared between them. Most commonly we observe  [3,2] or [3,3] anion arrangements for long or short dimers, respectively. Small populations of [1,4] dimers are found and are key to some interfacial disproportionation processes discussed below and in Section `Generation of active species'.

\subsection*{At the electrode-electrolyte interface}

What happens to species in the electrolyte as they approach an interface, such as the electrode surface? 
Firstly, as expected from simple statistical mechanics modeling of molecules at hard interfaces,~\cite{Henderson1976} the solvent, THF, adopts a layered molecular structure~\cite{Qiao2010,baskin2021} near the surface with a dense layer (DL) at 3-6~\AA{}, followed by a low-density `gap', and an intermediate density layer (IDL) at $\sim$~7-10~\AA{} \ from the surface,  with 2.5, 0.3 and 1.5 times the bulk THF density, respectively (Fig.~2 a). A third collective coordinate, calcium distance from the interface, sampled with metadynamics allows us to obtain the interfacial, 3D free-energy landscape (Fig.~2 b), of which the most distant slice is the 2D bulk free-energy landscape in Fig.~1 c. Dissolved species in the electrolyte near the electrode surface respect this underlying solvent layering with their free-energy minima distributed between the bulk, IDL, and DL, and separated by barriers, as indicated by minimum energy pathways of neutral and charged species approaching the interface in the 3D landscape (Fig.~2 c and d).

A key observation is that the IDL defines an attractive basin for most species, especially dimers and monocations, with minima in free energy that are lower than in the bulk, implying that this is a narrow interfacial region for enhanced concentration of solutes. Conversely, the DL defines a region from which solutes may be excluded due to additional free energy costs, without assistance of some applied bias (see below). This has some striking consequences for electrochemistry that  will be apparent when discussing reductive processes (see below).

Expanding our continuum model to include the presence of an electrode and the sampled interfacial free-energy hypersurface{~\cite{Wu2018, Baskin_2017, Baskin_2019_JCP}} allows us to calculate the potential of zero charge (PZC), which is -1.8 meV at 0.12 M, with negligible variations in interfacial concentration between open circuit potential (OCP) and PZC conditions. The metadynamics simulations used in this section, with zero excess charge, are thus representative of an open-circuit system.


Using our re-parametrized continuum model, we find that, next to this unbiased non-interacting electrode (Fig.~3 a), concentration effects are even stronger than in the bulk.  At 1.65 M,  the IDL is dominated ($\sim$~86\%) by dimers (long dimers in particular, 55\%), with reduced populations of neutral monomers ($\sim$~11\%) and a very slight increase to 2\% in the monocation population (Fig.~3 b). Around 30\% of the interfacial population is in the DL, where monocation population rapidly declines and dimers dominate ($\sim$~92\%) -- especially short dimers, in contrast to bulk and IDL populations. At low concentration, 0.12 M, only 13\% of the population is in the DL; neutral monomers dominate the DL and IDL; dimer population is limited to 15 and 18\% respectively; and there is a slight accumulation of monocation at the IDL (7\%).


Unsupervised clustering analysis of structures from umbrella-sampling trajectories at the IDL and DL (z = 8.25 and 5.75~\AA{}, respectively) reveals a reduced number of favored dimer isomers compared to the bulk, with one given isomer making $>$20~\% of the population in each case  (Fig.~3 c-d). In the IDL, this is a bent-axial long dimer with 6 solvating THF molecules (indexed as Isomer 7 or LD 6 THF - 7), already a favored species in the bulk. In the DL, on the other hand, a short dimer also with 6 THF molecules (SD 6 THF - 2) dominates. Furthermore, we find that the orientation of dimers at the interface is discretized (Fig.~3 e,f). Favored IDL dimers have mostly flat orientations of the Ca-Ca vector relative to the graphite surface, with two dense layer THF molecules involved in solvation. Similarly, the dominant dimer orientation in the DL is flat (i.e., in a plane parallel to the surface), with both calcium ions embedded in that dense region, and with two THF molecules from the IDL contributing to solvation. Additionally, perpendicular dimers form at least 11\% of the DL population. Isomer 4 of the short dimer with 5 THF molecules (SD THF 5 - 4) is an asymmetric dimer, with calcium ions solvated by 2 and 3 THF molecules that sit in the DL and on the edge of the IDL, respectively (Fig.~S3). 
Note that the specific conformation of these coordination complexes defines their effective dipole moment, which may, in some cases, be orthogonal to the Ca-Ca vector of the dimer. An example in the DL is the favored isomer SD 6 THF - 2, with its Ca-Ca vector parallel to the surface but three BH$_4^-$ sitting closer to the interface, near the corresponding DL free energy minimum for isolated borohydride in THF next to graphite (z= $\sim$4~\AA{}, see Fig.~S4). Dipole orientation will be discussed in more detail below in the context of biased interfaces.

The closest approach of fully solvated ions (as either dimers or neutral monomers at OCP) takes place in the IDL, which by some definitions is analogous to the Outer Helmholtz plane (OHP). Similarly, the DL is a close analogue of the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). One key distinction from textbook definitions of the IHP (usually for aqueous electrolytes) is that THF layering in the dense layer leads to a flat orientation of THF molecules with respect to the electrode surface, and we did not observe any large reorientation of its dipole with changes in surface charge (below). In this electrolyte only the dipole moments of dissolved complexes exhibit reorientation in the DL. Finally, lack of solvent layering more than 12~\AA{} from the electrode maps onto the diffuse layer.


\subsection*{Negatively biased interfaces}

So far, it seems that Ca(BH$_4$)$_2$ in THF is a poor electrolyte, with only a small fraction of the salt concentration (2\% for both 0.12~M and 1.65~M) present as charged species in the bulk, albeit with a noticeable enhancement to 7\% in the  IDL for a concentration of 0.12 M at OCP. Otherwise this electrolyte is dominated by neutral species (monomers and dimers). This is consistent with previous discussion of  undissociated neutral species as dominant in Ca-based electrolytes with boron-containing anions~\cite{forer-saboya2022}. However, the bulk free energy landscape (Fig.~1 c) indicates that interconversion of species is possible (more details below) and some equilibrium exists between charged and neutral species. We explore the impact of biased/charged electrodes on the population of solutes by evenly distributing opposing charges on either face of the two-layer graphite electrode model, which, under periodic boundary conditions, polarizes the electrolyte. We considered two specific charge states with (1) 0.065 and (2) 0.13~e/nm$^2$ (labeled CS1 and CS2, respectively). These surface charge densities  correspond to potential differences of $-$0.26~V (CS1) and $-$0.42~V (CS2), calculated using our continuum model (see Methods) assuming a simulated bulk concentration of 0.12 M. (Note that at higher bulk concentrations, with a shorter Debye screening length, this estimated potential difference should be even smaller -- at 1.65 M: $-$0.20~V (CS1) and $-$0.35~V (CS2).)  These potentials are sufficient to draw monocations into the dense layer.

\label{fig:negative_interface}
\end{figure*}


From Fig.~2 (a) we see that the solvent layering remains practically unchanged upon charging the electrode.
At high concentration (1.65 M), a third of the interfacial population is in the DL. Dimers are still the most favored species in the DL and IDL in both charge states (Fig.~2 a, b). With increase in the bias potential,  some charged species become strongly stabilized at the interface. Specifically, the monocation, CaBH$_4^+$, partly displaces the neutral dimers and monomers (Fig.4 b)  to become up to 27 and 21\% of each layer's population, respectively (compared to 0.3 and 2\% in the unbiased electrode). The concentration dependence already seen at the unbiased electrode becomes far more striking at negative biases. Low concentration (0.12 M) leads to a sparser DL, which constitutes only 16\% of the total interfacial population. Both DL and IDL are completely dominated by the monocation  (98 and 92 \%  respectively, for CS2) while dimer population declines less than 1\% in both. As in the unbiased electrode, the bulk population at low concentration consists mostly of neutral monomers (95\%).

Notably, the peak concentration of monocation in the DL sits near its external edge, at $\sim$~6~\AA{}. At this potential, the approach of the monocation to the electrode, through the DL, would have to be an endergonic process, requiring 5.7~kT of free energy, overcoming a barrier of 7.5~kT. Although, this is some improvement over the case of the neutral electrode, which presents a barrier of 9.9~kT to enter the DL, with a required input of 9.1~kT of free energy.

We can understand these free energy costs by following the evolution in solvation and associated dipole orientation of the monocation. Unsupervised learning analysis of various umbrella sampling trajectories: in the IDL, at the edge of the DL and in the DL (z = 8.25, 5.8 and 4.8~\AA{}, Fig.~4 c-e), reveals that five-fold THF coordination dominates the IDL population, with the BH$_4^-$ anion pointing away from the surface -- as one might expect given the direction of the electric field at the negative electrode. 
However, this dipole reorients at the edge of the DL, likely due to mixed DL/IDL solvent coordination, and a small four-fold 
THF coordinated population appears. Ultimately, in the center of the DL, four-fold coordination dominates, with the dipole of the predominant isomer pointing away from the surface again. 

This complicated and costly path for the monocation to reach the electrode further emphasizes the important role of the THF solvent layering and specific coordination in determining the electrochemical activity. By the same token, the fully-solvated dication, Ca$^{2+}$, with its somewhat rigid first solvation shell, is still too unfavorable to define a noticeable population at these bias potentials, despite its higher electrostatic charge. Stabilization of Ca$^{2+}$ species to reach non-negligible concentrations is only achieved at relatively large (yet still non-reductive) potential differences in the inner DL ($<$~-1.1~V at 1.65~M), where preferred isomer structures are undercoordinated and flattened (see below).

\subsection*{Generation of active species}

Thus far, it seems that the monocation, CaBH$_4^+$, is the strongest candidate for the electroactive species in this electrolyte, given its high population in the vicinity of the electrode upon  negative charging. 
The fact remains that this poor electrolyte (only 2\% of species in solution are charged, as mentioned above) must supply the DL and IDL with monocations in the first place, via some disproportionation mechanism from neutral species (most likely dimers), and replenish the same species while electroreduction and electrode deposition consumes them. Any barriers in this supply chain should be evident in the kinetics of the electrochemistry as an observed deposition overpotential or associated rate limitations in charging cells with this electrolyte. The much smaller concentration of dimers in low concentration electrolytes may be partly behind the loss of performance observed in experiments at concentrations below 0.5~M -- which exhibit lower current densities and lower Coulombic efficiencies.{~\cite{hahn2020, YangTrahey2023}}  

To shed light on the underlying processes, we approach the generation of charged species (monocations) as a two-step process, involving dimer reorganization and disproportionation. As we show below, the most stable or prevalent dimer species are not readily disposed to disproportionate. Some molecular rearrangement of borohydride anions and solvent molecules is first required. The subsequent disproportionation follows two major pathways, which can occur in the bulk electrolyte or at the interface, and which we have investigated both at neutral and negative biases.

In the neutral cell, increased dimer concentrations in the IDL are readily explained through analysis of the free energy landscape (Fig.~2). 
The minimum energy path (MEP) for disproportionation in the presence of the interface indicates that neutral species in the bulk can easily flow, without a significant free energy barrier, into the IDL. Migration from the bulk to the IDL is essentially barrierless for all species except Ca$^{2+}$. As summarized in Fig.~5 a, to prepare for disproportionation of the most favorable dimers, some reorganization into an intermediate (less stable) dimer is required and ultimately Ca-Ca separation into ionic species follows two main paths, A or B.

For Path A, the dominant long dimer configuration (\textbf{1} in Fig.~5 a) can undergo a low-barrier reorganization, through a short dimer (\textbf{2}), to another long dimer with similar coordination of Ca ions with borohydrides (\textbf{3}). Then, the Ca-Ca distance increases (\textbf{4}) up to  6.7~\AA{} at the transition state so that the nascent monocation Ca ion can increase its number of coordinating THF molecules, from the original 3-4 to the preferred 5, upon full dissociation. Path B branches from the short (\textbf{2}) or intermediate long (\textbf{3}) conformations, through further borohydride and solvent reorganization, to a higher energy dimer (\textbf{5}), with a [1,4] anion coordination, which then disproportionates to produce the monocation (\textbf{6}).   

Figures~5 b and c outline the MEP for disproportionation at the electrode interface or in the bulk electrolyte under neutral or negative bias. Overall, at the electrode interface, in the IDL, disproportionation follows Path A, whereas Path B is preferred in the bulk, likely due to configuration \textbf{5} being more favorable in the bulk than at the interface
(Fig.~S5). 

We find that interfacial (IDL) disproportionation at zero bias via Path A is favored, since it has slightly lower barriers (E$_{a, 3\rightarrow4}$ = 8.4~kT and E$_{a, 4\rightarrow 6}$ = 9.8~kT) and a lower free energy cost than bulk disproportionation via Path B (Fig.~5 b). This is in agreement with the slight increase in monocation population observed at the IDL in Fig.~3 (Slight variations in barriers between bulk and interface models can be due to differences in the collective variables and grid-spacing employed in our metadynamics simulations, SI Table S1). 

At the negatively charged electrode, we have seen (Fig.4) that the monocation is favored in the DL and IDL, displacing the previously dominant dimers  (neutral monomers) at high (low) concentration  with increasing negative charge on the electrode (CS2). Due to the size limits of our metadynamics simulations, we may well expect that the bulk thermodynamics are somewhat different from those under neutral conditions, however, disproportionation still follows Path B in our simulations (Fig.~5 c), albeit with an additional step involving the formation of a long dimer conformation (\textbf{3}). Similarly, Path A is still preferred in the IDL. Although disproportionation occurs in the bulk, barrier-less pathways to the IDL suggest that dimers can approach the charged IDL and undergo disproportionation quite favorably. 
Therefore, upon negative charging, the concentration of monocations should increase in the IDL, based on a favorable free energy and necessary -- highly concentration-dependent-- supply from the local (IDL) dimer population via interfacial disproportionation.

\end{figure*}

\subsection*{Reductive processes and the seeds of the SEI}

The   stabilization of the monocation in the DL at negative bias results in a significant increase within the overall interfacial (DL plus IDL) population of this species -- from $\sim$1\% (6\%) in the unbiased electrode to $\sim$23\% (94)\% for CS2 at 1.65~M (0.12~M). Structural analysis indicates that these monocations have their anionic end pointing away from the negative surface and have lower solvent coordination.

Using our interfacial continuum model, we explore increasingly negative electrode potentials at or slightly above the thermodynamic Ca deposition potential ($-$2.25 V, see Supplementary Information 3).
 We limit our discussion here to an electrolyte concentration of 1.65~M. Strikingly, a highly-localized dication population appears in the inner DL (3 to 5~\AA{}, Fig.~6 a). Unsupervised learning analysis, this time including whole solvent molecules in the coordination sphere, reveals that dication coordination at these short distances consists mostly of flattened, under-solvated (5 THF) structures. The more dominant monocation population is pushed slightly outwards by that first dication layer. This begs the question as to which species contributes the most to the electron transfer rate.

Electrochemical activity is a strong (exponentially decaying) function of distance of the reducible species from the electrode. It is also very likely enhanced by reduced cation coordination, i.e., favoring reduction of species that are less thermodynamically stable.{~\cite{Baskin2019}} However, this increased thermodynamic cost would also lower the local concentration of the same species. Additionally, the magnitude of the required reduction potential of a given species can increase with proximity to the interface, due to the stabilization of positively charged species by the negative electrode potential. This trade-off between species availability (concentration), distance to the electrode and reductive stability is key in determining each species contribution to the electron transfer rate.

The reduction potential of each isomer was calculated using a combination of quantum-chemical calculations, free-energy sampling and potential-dependent concentration profiles from the continuum model. Contributions to an effective electron-transfer (ET) rate were estimated based on distance dependent tunneling decay, reduction potential and isomer concentration (see Methods). Note that the concentration (more precisely, activity) dependence of the ET rate effectively follows the Nernst equation, although we are not modeling an equilibrium process here. Based on our calculations, we see 100- to 10,000-fold increases in the ET rate as we increase the electrolyte concentration from 0.12~M to 1.65~M (see Fig.~S6). In what follows, we focus on results for 1.65~M electrolytes. 

We further simulated the effect of SEI growth on ET rate within the continuum model by including a progressively wider dielectric spacer, under the assumption that electrons could tunnel through it with the same decay constant. In Fig.~6(a) we can see that the effect of holding incoming positively charged species farther away from the negatively charged electrode is to reduce their effective concentrations in the interfacial (dielectric-electrolyte) region, due to the decreasing potential difference in this region with increased spacer width. Most noticeably, this removes the interfacial population of dications that we observed at the pristine electrode. 

Increases in the magnitude of the negative electrode potential above the thermodynamic deposition potential (labeled as overpotential here) have only minor effects on these concentration profiles. However, the species-dependent reduction potentials and the combined estimate of the ET rate are strong functions of this overpotential. In fact, the presence of a dielectric spacer that is close in width to the ET decay length (approximated as 1~nm here) appears to lower the required overpotential to reach the same effective ET rate, as shown in Fig.~6(b). For example, the pristine electrode exhibits an effective ET rate of $\sim 10^2$ at a 0.25~V overpotential, while the same or higher rate is possible with dielectric spacers of 0.5 to 1.5 times the ET decay length at a smaller 0.10~V overpotential. Note that the overpotentials discussed here are thermodynamic in origin. 

With no dielectric spacer, the main contributing species to the ET rate are monocations coordinated by 4 THF molecules in two specific arrangements (4 THF 0 and 4 THF 2), nominally undercoordinated and flattened with respect to their bulk electrolyte coordination, located at the outer edge of the DL (beyond 5~\AA{}). A representative molecular structure is provided in the inset of Fig.~6 (c) (see the rest in Fig.~S7). Interestingly, these monocations are not as close to the electrode as they could be, because of the presence of dications stabilized by the strong negative potential difference close to the electrode. However, the same dications require a larger overpotential to be reduced due to the stabilization provided by this potential difference, and thus do not contribute significantly to the effective ET rate.

With a 5~\AA{} spacer, the potential difference at the electrolyte interface is now lower, and the less thermodynamically favorable dication population disappears. The electroactive species in the DL region are now exclusively monocations, which can occupy the inner DL and be reduced at lower overpotentials due to a decrease in thermodynamic stabilization by the smaller potential difference this far from the electrode.

The final outcome of this analysis is that the under-coordinated monocations in the DL are the dominant contributors to the electrochemical activity, with negligible contributions from the IDL, as shown in Fig.~6(c). Therefore, we would conclude that Ca electrodeposition is defined by inner sphere processes in this electrolyte. And, surprisingly, that the presence of a thin SEI layer may reduce the required (thermodynamic) overpotential for electrodeposition, indicating the importance of activating such electrodes during the first charge.


\section*{Discussion}

Based on our analysis of the Ca(BH$_4$)$_2|$THF electrolyte and its interfacial speciation, we can propose the following phenomenology that may explain existing observation and provide guidance and interpretation of future characterization efforts. 

First and foremost, competition between the solvent, THF, and the anions, BH$_4^-$, for coordination of the dication, Ca$^{2+}$ leads to an electrolyte dominated by neutral species, mostly monomers, Ca(BH$_4$)$_2$, with an increasing prevalence of neutral dimers, Ca$_2$(BH$_4$)$_4$, with increasing concentration. The formation of charged species is facilitated by disproportionation of dimers rather than the more thermodynamically expensive direct dissociation of neutral monomers.

Strong solvent layering defines two interfacial regions within the first nanometer of the electrolyte: a dense layer inside 6~\AA{} and an intermediate density layer, from 7--10~\AA{}. These layers present mildly attractive or repulsive thermodynamic potentials that modulate the interfacial population of all species relative to the bulk electrolyte, even in the absence of electrode biasing. With increasing concentration, we see enhancements in the populations of various species in these interfacial zones, which has important consequences both for the availability of these species for electrochemical processes (the monocation CaBH$_4^+$) and their replenishment (via dimer disproportionation).

Overall, this is a poor electrolyte, with very low concentrations of charged species in bulk solution. However, it is ``activated'' at biased electrodes within this narrow interfacial region, wherein large relative populations of charged species emerge, especially with increasing concentration.
Therefore, meaningful characterization of the electrochemical activity of this electrolyte requires operando measurements that are sensitive to within a nanometer of the interface. The rich isomer subpopulations with distinct orientations in the IDL make it an excellent playground for interfacially-sensitive, polarization-dependent spectroscopies that can capture these differences. Furthermore, the bias-dependent switch in local population from oriented dimers to monocations should be observable with chemically-sensitive vibrational~\cite{Lu2019, Yang2022, He2022} and electronic probes.~\cite{velasco2014, Wu2018, Prabhakaran2023}

With increasing negative potentials up to and exceeding the thermodynamic potential for Ca deposition, we find that the pristine electrode may require a significant overpotential to register a deposition current. However, the presence of a thin SEI (introduced here as a dielectric spacer) can reduce this overpotential significantly, due to decreased electrostatic stabilization of charged species.  
This may explain the observation in previous work, that electrochemical activity, viz.  plating of Ca using this electrolyte carries a first, short duration overpotential of $\sim$250~mV, followed by a $\sim$100~mV overpotential in subsequent cycles.~\cite{Wang2018}

In addition, we find strong dependence in the electron transfer rate on the overall bulk concentration, primarily due to a decrease in the overpotential required for each species as its relative concentration increases (as seen in the Nernst equation).

Strong solvent and anion coordination of electrochemically active species, which has dominated our analysis, is very likely the source of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation due to electroreduction and decomposition of these ligands at the interface, as highlighted recently through electron microscopy.{~\cite{McClary2022}} Similarly, for other multivalent ion electrolytes,  we know, TFSI is both inherently and electrochemically unstable, for Mg~\cite{Yu2017} and for Ca.~\cite{hahn2022} 

Increased electroreductive stability in large anions may be afforded by considering non-cation-coordinating species. For example, closoboranes have been studied with Mg in tetraglyme.~\cite{Jay2019} These bulkier anions may also lead to better electrolytes overall (for example, preventing the formation of dimers), readily producing charged electroactive species. Although, strong solvent coordination, as we have seen for the fully-solvated Ca$^{2+}$, may still lead to significant overpotentials for electrodeposition and associated solvent decomposition and SEI growth.

From the computational perspective, we have highlighted the value of free-energy exploration, through combined molecular dynamics and continuum modeling, and unsupervised learning to reveal the complexity of this nominally simple electrolyte and tried to connect our simulations to observed electrochemical behavior and characterization. However, as in all theoretical models, our study has some inherent limitations. The complexity of the system and the time-scales required to explore different coordination complexes required the use of empirical force fields rather than ab initio methods. The finite number of dissolved species in our MD simulations mimics only low concentrations, which we extend to higher concentrations only at the level of our continuum model. Accurate inclusion of Debye screening from finite ionic concentrations, and dielectric screening due to solvent or anion polarizability{~\cite{Bedrov2019}} (which we approximate only by charge rescaling) should be considered in future studies.

The notable outcome of this study is a reinforcement of the notion that performant nonaqueous multivalent electrolytes (with high ionic conductivity and low overpotential) have competing requirements for multivalent ion coordination: to be strongly coordinating to keep the salt dissolved and the ionic conductivity high while not so strongly coordinating that the ion cannot break free from solvation during electrodeposition. The need for strong solvent coordination is driven by competition with favorable ionic bonds between counterions. If we want to maintain the advantages of earth-abundant, multivalent ions, then one option would be to switch to larger anions without specific coordinating moieties. However, this study highlights that there may be other options to consider that sideline the isolated multivalent ion altogether, which may even be irrelevant in terms of electrochemical activity. Firstly, that coordination with counterions may actually help bring active species closer to the electrode and that the strength of solvent coordination can dictate which species approaches the electrode closest. Secondly, that incomplete dissolution and the involvement of oligomers (dimers in this case) could be key to improved electrochemical activity albeit balanced by some power limitations due to reduced bulk ionic conductivity and the need to regenerate electroactive species through a disproportionation equilibrium. Clearly we have more work to do, both in terms of understanding the specifics of reduction of these clusters and their dissociation in the reduced state leading to Ca deposition; the potential negative side-effects of reductive instability of the coordinating species, already connected to SEI formation;~\cite{McClary2022} and the ultimate origins of measured overpotentials and currents in experiments. However, we have highlighted the importance of free energy sampling to attack such complex problems, even within relatively ideal conditions and contexts, and look forward to seeing more studies of this kind in the future.


\section*{Methods}

Metadynamics sampling (MTD) with a classical force-field was used to obtain free-energy landscapes as a function of $n$ collective variables. Equilibrium populations at critical points of a given landscape were then collected with Umbrella Sampling (US). Structural analysis of the US trajectories was then performed with a python-based unsupervised learning protocol. In order to explore the effects of finite concentration and bias potential at the electrode, a continuum model was developed within the modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation framework with inclusion of chemical equilibrium parameterized from the sampled free-energy differences. Finally, reduction potentials were calculated using the results of the continuum model and quantum-chemical calculations of the structures obtained from the unsupervised learning analysis. 

\paragraph{Free-energy sampling.} Metadynamics free-energy sampling~\cite{Laio2002} was carried out using the COLVARS module~\cite{colvars} implemented in LAMMPS.~\cite{lammps} Systems (see Table S1 for a full list) were generated using Packmol~\cite{martinez2009}. Concentration values were chosen to avoid forcing aggregation. Dimerization free energy surfaces show that at Ca-Ca distances larger than $\sim$ 10~\AA{}, the free energy converges with respect to Ca-Ca separation. That is the cutoff we consider between ``dissociated" and ``aggregated", giving an effective radius of 5~\AA{} for the first coordination shell of the dication. Additionally, g(r) shows that the second solvation shell (O-THF) settles at around 6~\AA{}. Assuming an optimal close-packing of ions, we deduce that solvent-separated ion pairs  would be unavoidable at concentrations above 0.5~M for a 6~\AA{} radius and 0.7~M for a 5~\AA{} radius. Hence, we selected concentrations $\leq$ 0.03M, well below these limits. System equilibration consisted of conjugate-gradient minimization to avoid steric clashes, followed by a short NVT warm-up to room temperature  (298 K) using a 1 fs timestep. Box-size equilibration was achieved by continuing the trajectory under NPT conditions at 1 atm with a 2 fs timestep. A final NVT step with the equilibrated lattice parameters (~ 20 ns) was sufficient to bring the systems to equilibrium. Force-field parameters~\cite{samba2009, andrade2002} were validated in our previous work on the same system.~\cite{Roncoroni2023} The graphene was frozen in place by setting the forces to zero in order to ensure neutral and charged simulations were comparable. These MD setup was kept for the MTD and US simulations. Metadynamics calculation parameters -- the width of the grid along a collective variable (W), height of the Gaussian 'hills' used to bias the potential (H) and the frequency at which they are added (Freq) -- can be found in SI Table S1 and were chosen to ensure convergence, namely, that the simulation reached  the diffusive regime in the given collective variable space.~\cite{baskin2021} Faster completion times were achieved by taking advantage of multiple-walker metadynamics, which allows to parallelize sampling among several trajectories (replicas) that update their biased potential at a given frequency (RepFreq) with the total biased potential. Despite this, the grid used in the three-dimensional MTD calculations was necessarily coarser. The minima explored here tend to be separated by more than 0.7~\AA{} (e.g., between the long and short dimer, or between solvent layers), which is larger than the coarser grid resolution. In order to keep cell neutrality and consistence with the neutral simulation, charge states 1 (CS1) and 2 (CS2) were generated by adding equal and opposite charges ($\pm$ 2 $\mu$C/cm$^2$) distributed evenly among two graphene layers, emulating a positively charged and a negatively charged electrode. 

Free-energy sampling was performed with combinations of the following collective variables: the distance between the calcium and the center of mass of the top graphene layer (dZ); the coordination number between the calcium and the boron atom in a given BH$_4$ (CN(Ca-B), r$_0$ = 3.8~\AA{}); and, to track dimerization, the distance between two calcium atoms (dCa) or a Ca-Ca coordination number (CN(Ca-Ca), r$_0$ = 6.5~\AA{}).

Note that the state free-energies in Fig.~1 b) were obtained by thermodynamic integration of our 2D free energy surface (Fig.~1 c) over regions delimited by given collective variable values  (e.g., for the Ca(BH$_4$)$_4^{2-}$ state, a Ca-Ca distance larger that 7~\AA{} and a CN(Ca-B) larger than 3.5).  Collective variables apply to only one of the calcium atoms, and hence the free energy is averaged over all (remaining) possible coordinations/distances  for the other atom. Hence, the room-temperature Boltzmann probability speaks of the likelihood of finding a state formed by the constrained species (e.g., Ca(BH$_4$)$_4^{2-}$) in the environment of the remaining, unconstrained species. Since our system contains two calciums and four borohydrides, the un-constrained space is different depending on the value of the collective variables. In the Ca(BH$_4$)$_4^{2-}$ basin, the un-constrained Ca can only be fully solvated. 
On the other hand, in the Ca${2+}$ basin, the other calcium can exist in five different ion coordination states (Ca$^{2+}$, Ca(BH$_4$)$^{+}$, Ca(BH$_4$)$_2$, Ca(BH$_4$)$_3^{-}$, and Ca(BH$_4$)$_4^{2-}$). This is the reason why no  symmetry is expected on the free energy surface along the coordination axis, e.g., between CN=0 and CN=4; and CN=1 and CN=3.


\paragraph{Population sampling} The structures and equilibrium population of points of interest in the free energy surface were collected using Umbrella Sampling. Initial structures were obtained from metadynamics trajectory snapshots at the desired point in the CV space. The collective variable coordinates were restrained with a harmonic potential centered at the desired value, with force constant 1/w$^2$ where w is the width of the collective variable grid (see SI Table S1). Then, trajectories of 150-200 ns were calculated under similar MD parameters as the final equilibration step and MTD run. 

\paragraph{Data analysis.} Umbrella sampling trajectories were analyzed with an unsupervised learning methodology recently developed by us.~\cite{Roncoroni2023} 
In this protocol, between 5000 and 10000 local atomic arrangements were extracted from each US trajectory, and aligned while taking into account possible permutations between similar elements (e.g. THF - O).~\cite{Gunde2022,Griffiths2017} 
Classification based on their structural similarity was carried out using dimensionality reduction~\cite{McInnes2018,Becht2019}  and clustering~\cite{McInnes2017} algorithms, in an ASE-compatible~\cite{Larsen_2017} environment. 
The $n$-dimensional free energy landscapes obtained from the MTD sampling were explored with a Jupyter-adapted version of the MEPSAnd module~\cite{Marcos-Alcalde2019} in order to find critical points and minimum energy pathways. 

\paragraph{Continuum Model.} The free-energy of a system formed by a finite concentration of multiple (charged) species by a (charged) electrode was minimized using a beyond Gouy-Chapman model based on a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation.{\cite{Baskin_2017, Wu2018, Baskin_2019_JCP}} This continuum model accounts for the electrostatic potential of the electrode as well as each species' specific adsorption (the so-called Frumkin effects),{\cite{Bard2022, White2014, Willard2020, PEndergast_2023}}, chemical potential and entropic (volume exclusion) effects, and chemical re-equilibration between species; parameterised from free-energy sampling results.

\paragraph{Electron Transfer Rate Estimates.} The electron transfer rate estimate $I$ was obtained by integrating the individual contributions of isomers over the interface:

\begin{equation}
    I \propto \sum_{s} \int_{z} dz  C_{s} (z) e^{-z/z_0} e^{-\Delta G_s/ k_B T}
\end{equation}
 where $C_{s}(z)$, each isomer's concentration profile, was obtained by renormalizing the species' concentration profiles of the continuum model  with the US/UL isomer layer populations. $z_0$ is the electron tunneling decay length, set to 1~nm here. The reduction potential for a given isomer, $\Delta G_s$, was obtained using Density Functional Theory (see SI Section 2).

For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}}

abstract  ="The organic electrolyte of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in the aprotic solvent of acetonitrile (ACN) is widely used in electrochemical systems such as electrochemical capacitors. In this paper{,} we examine the solvation of TEA+ and BF4− in ACN{,} and the structure{,} capacitance{,} and dynamics of the electrical double layers (EDLs) in the TEABF4–ACN electrolyte using molecular dynamics simulations complemented with quantum density functional theory calculations. The solvation of TEA+ and BF4− ions is found to be much weaker than that of small inorganic ions in aqueous solutions{,} and the ACN molecules in the solvation shell of both types of ions show only weak packing and orientational ordering. These solvation characteristics are caused by the large size{,} charge delocalization{,} and irregular shape (in the case of TEA+ cation) of the ions. Near neutral electrodes{,} the double-layer structure in the organic electrolyte exhibits a rich organization: the solvent shows strong layering and orientational ordering{,} ions are significantly contact-adsorbed on the electrode{,} and alternating layers of cations/anions penetrate ca. 1.1 nm into the bulk electrolyte. The significant contact adsorption of ions and the alternating layering of cation/anion are new features found for EDLs in organic electrolytes. These features essentially originate from the fact that van der Waals interactions between organic ions and the electrode are strong and the partial desolvation of these ions occurs easily{,} as a result of the large size of the organic ions. Near charged electrodes{,} distinct counter-ion concentration peaks form{,} and the ion distribution cannot be described by the Helmholtz model or the Helmholtz + Poisson–Boltzmann model. This is because the number of counter-ions adsorbed on the electrode exceeds the number of electrons on the electrode{,} and the electrode is over-screened in parts of the EDL. The computed capacitances of the EDLs are in good agreement with that inferred from experimental measurements. Both the rotations (ACN only) and translations of interfacial ACN and ions are found to slow down as the electrode is electrified. We also observe an asymmetrical dependence of these motions on the sign of the electrode charge. The rotation/diffusion of ACN and the diffusion of ions in the region beyond the first ACN or ion layer differ only weakly from those in the bulk."}

abstract={Solid-state batteries possess the potential to significantly impact energy storage industries by enabling diverse benefits, such as increased safety and energy density. However, challenges persist with physicochemical properties and processes at electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Thus, there is great need to characterize such interfaces in situ, and unveil scientific understanding that catalyzes engineering solutions. To address this, we conduct multiscale in situ microscopies (optical, atomic force, and infrared near-field) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies (near-field nanospectroscopy and attenuated total reflection) of intact and electrochemically operational graphene/solid polymer electrolyte interfaces. We find nanoscale structural and chemical heterogeneities intrinsic to the solid polymer electrolyte initiate a cascade of additional interfacial nanoscale heterogeneities during Li plating and stripping; including Li-ion conductivity, electrolyte decomposition, and interphase formation. Moreover, our methodology to nondestructively characterize buried interfaces and interphases in their native environment with nanoscale resolution is readily adaptable to a number of other electrochemical systems and battery chemistries.},

abstract = {The molecular structure of the electrical double layer determines the chemistry in all electrochemical processes. Using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we probed the structure of water near gold electrodes and its bias dependence. Electron yield XAS detected at the gold electrode revealed that the interfacial water molecules have a different structure from those in the bulk. First principles calculations revealed that ~50\% of the molecules lie flat on the surface with saturated hydrogen bonds and another substantial fraction with broken hydrogen bonds that do not contribute to the XAS spectrum because their core-excited states are delocalized by coupling with the gold substrate. At negative bias, the population of flat-lying molecules with broken hydrogen bonds increases, producing a spectrum similar to that of bulk water. The water double-layer structure at an electrode changed from ordered to disordered when the applied bias was switched. The structure of water within a nanometer of an electrode surface is known as the electrical double layer. This layer creates a strong electrical field that can affect electrochemical reactions. Velasco-Velez et al. explored the structure of the electrical double layer at a bare gold electrode. With no applied potential and at positive potentials, the layer is highly structured (resembling ice) with few dangling hydrogen bonds. However, at negative potentials, the layer was more like bulk water, and half of the water molecules lie flat on the surface. Science, this issue p. 831}}

abstract = {Abstract Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files.

A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.}}

The need for energy storage technologies that meet the demands for safety, sustainability, and high energy density has spurred increased interests in rechargeable Mg batteries. However, verification of their potential remains hampered by the absence of practical components. Recently, an unconventional research direction that deviates from the mainstream path has emerged and is redefining the boundaries of what can be accomplished in Mg batteries. Herein, we analyze this direction with a focus on fundamental phenomena with an aim to reveal new opportunities that can overcome long-standing challenges and unveil unaddressed issues. The topics covered encompass: (1) realizing efficient single salt Mg electrolytes that mimic those used in typical Li- and Na-ion batteries, (2) discovery of important concomitant mechanisms and previously unanticipated interfacial phenomena, and (3) identification of often overlooked bottlenecks in Mg cathodes and alternative anodes. In closing, we put forward our proposal for R&D focuses to help realize practical Mg batteries.}}

abstract = {Abstract The development of high energy density battery technologies based on divalent metals as the negative electrode is very appealing. Ca and Mg are especially interesting choices due to their combination of low standard reduction potential and natural abundance. One particular problem stalling the technological development of these batteries is the low efficiency of plating/stripping at the negative electrode, which relates to several factors that have not yet been looked at systematically; the nature/concentration of the electrolyte, which determines the mass transport of electro-active species (cation complexes) toward the electrode; the possible presence of passivation layers, which may hinder ionic transport and hence limit electrodeposition; and the mechanisms behind the charge transfer leading to nucleation/growth of the metal. Different electrolytes are investigated for Mg and Ca, with the presence/absence of chlorides in the formulation playing a crucial role in the cation desolvation. From a R\&D point-of-view, proper characterization alongside modeling is crucial to understand the phenomena determining the mechanisms of the plating/stripping processes. The state-of-the-art is here presented together with a short perspective on the influence of the cation solvation also on the positive electrode and finally an attempt to define guidelines for future research in the field.},

abstract = {Abstract Calcium-metal batteries have received growing attention recently after several studies reporting successful metal plating and stripping with organic electrolytes. Given the low redox potential of metallic calcium, its surface is commonly covered by a passivation layer grown by the accumulation of electrolyte decomposition products. The presence of borate species in this layer has been shown to be a key parameter allowing for Ca2+ migration and favoring Ca electrodeposition. Here, boron-based additives are evaluated in order to tune the SEI composition, morphology, and properties. The decomposition of a BF3-based additive is studied at different potentiostatic steps and the resulting SEI layer was thoroughly characterized. SEI growth mechanism is proposed based on both experimental data and DFT calculations pointing at the formation of boron-crosslinked polymeric matrices. Several boron-based adducts are explored as SEI-forming additives for calcium-metal batteries paving the way to very rich chemistry leading to Ca2+ conducting SEI.},

However, several critical issues hindered its development, especially the unsatisfactory performance of anode materials due to the poor plating/stripping reversibility Ca metal and sluggish de-solvation kinetics of Ca2+ ion in the electrolyte. This review aims to provide a timely access to the state-of-art advance in anode chemistry of CIBs. Firstly, an overview on the development history of CIBs is presented. Then, a comprehensive understanding on the challenges facing CIBs is elaborated. The advancements on the development of appropriate salts and electrolytes to achieve highly reversible plating/stripping of calcium metal anode are systematically discussed. As alternative to metallic calcium anode, suitable anode candidates for hosting calcium ions are summarized, including alloying, intercalation, and organic electrodes systems. Finally, critical challenges for metallic calcium and alternative anode materials are envisioned, followed by their important future directions for the development and application in CIBs.}

abstract = {As a new type of multi-electron transfer device, rechargeable aluminum batteries are promising post-lithium ion batteries owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, it is unknown whether Al3+ can be reversibly stored in the lattice of the host electrode material because of its small cation diameter and high valence state, thus trapping it tightly in lattice or defect sites. Here, we report the reversible storage of Al3+ in V2O5 nanowires. It is found that Al3+ intercalates into crystalized V2O5 nanowires in the first discharge. Meanwhile, this electrochemical intercalation leads to the reduction of V5+ and the formation of an amorphous layer on the edge of nanowires. In the subsequent cycling, a new phase forms along the nanowires’ edges and a two-phase transition reaction occurs. Our findings demonstrate clearly for the first time that it is possible that Al3+ can be inserted into the metal oxide and stored reversibly through intercalation and a phase-transition reaction, which is expected to inspire more comprehensive investigations for rechargeable aluminum batteries.}

abstract = {Divalent rechargeable metal batteries such as those based on magnesium and calcium are of interest because of the abundance of these elements and their lower tendency to form dendrites, but practical demonstrations are lacking. Hou et al. used methoxyethyl amine chelants in which the ligands attach to the metal atom in more than one place, modulating the solvation structure of the metal ions to enable a facile charge-transfer reaction (see the Perspective by Zuo and Yin). In full battery cells, these components lead to high efficiency and energy density. Theoretical calculations were used to understand the solvation structures. —MSL Chelating ligands promote fast charge-transfer kinetics for Mg and Ca batteries with substantially lowered overpotentials. Rechargeable magnesium and calcium metal batteries (RMBs and RCBs) are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries because of the high crustal abundance and capacity of magnesium and calcium. Yet, they are plagued by sluggish kinetics and parasitic reactions. We found a family of methoxyethyl-amine chelants that greatly promote interfacial charge transfer kinetics and suppress side reactions on both the cathode and metal anode through solvation sheath reorganization, thus enabling stable and highly reversible cycling of the RMB and RCB full cells with energy densities of 412 and 471 watt-hours per kilogram, respectively. This work provides a versatile electrolyte design strategy for divalent metal batteries.}}

abstract={Magnesium batteries have long been pursued as potentially low-cost, high-energy and safe alternatives to Li-ion batteries.

All three components significantly influence electrochemical characteristics and energy density of rechargeable magnesium batteries. Although there are many reports showing progress in the cyclability and stability of different systems, only few cathode materials promise possible commercialization. Remaining issues with efficiency, magnesium anode processing and electrolyte compatibility with cell housing are preventing faster development of technology with high possible impact on the future battery landscape. In the given perspective paper a critical overview on electrolytes, anode materials and three different classes of cathode materials is reported. Different rechargeable magnesium battery configurations were assumed and their dependence of volumetric energy densities on gravimetric energy densities are provided assuming realistic conditions with optimized electrode thicknesses and loadings, electrode porosity and optimized electrolyte quantity.

For solution-grown crystals, desolvation at kink sites can be the rate-limiting step for growth. However, desolvation and the associated kinetic barriers are poorly understood. In this work, we use rare-event simulation techniques to investigate attachment/detachment events at kink sites of a NaCl crystal in water. We elucidate the desolvation mechanism and present an optimized reaction coordinate, which involves one solute collective variable and one solvent collective variable. The attachment/detachment pathways for Na+ and Cl− are qualitatively similar, with quantitative differences that we attribute to different ion sizes and solvent coordination. The attachment barriers primarily result from kink site desolvation, while detachment barriers largely result from breaking ion–crystal bonds. We compute ion detachment rates from kink sites and compare with results from an independent study. We anticipate that the reaction coordinate and desolvation mechanism identified in this work may be applicable to other alkali halides.}}

However, significant pitfalls in metal plating and stripping arise from electrolyte decomposition and can be related to the coordination environment around Ca2+ with both the negatively charged anion and the organic–aprotic solvent. In this study, we apply multiple spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with density functional theory to evaluate the coordination environment of Ca2+ across a class of ethereal solvents. Through the combination of X-ray absorption fine structure and time-dependent density functional theory, descriptive measures of the local geometry, coordination, and electronic structure of Ca–ethereal complexes provide distinct structural trends depending on the extent of the Ca2+–solvent interaction. Finally, we correlate these findings with electrochemical measurements of calcium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropoxy)borate (CaBHFIP2) salts dissolved within this class of solvents to provide insight into the preferred structural configuration of Ca2+ electrolytic solutions for optimized electrochemical plating and stripping.}}

abstract = {Abstract Calcium-metal batteries (CMBs) provide a promising option for high-energy and cost-effective energy-storage technology beyond the current state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the development of room-temperature CMBs is significantly impeded by the poor reversibility and short lifespan of the calcium-metal anode. A solvation manipulation strategy is reported to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of calcium-metal anodes by enhancing the desolvation kinetics of calcium ions in the electrolyte. The introduction of lithium salt changes the electrolyte structure considerably by reducing coordination number of calcium ions in the first solvation shell. As a result, an unprecedented Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.1 \% is achieved for galvanostatic plating/stripping of the calcium-metal anode, accompanied by a very stable long-term cycling performance over 200 cycles at room temperature. This work may open up new opportunities for development of practical CMBs.},

When charged (reduced), graphite accommodates solvated Ca2+-ions (Ca-G4) and delivers a reversible capacity of 62 mAh g−1 that signifies the formation of a ternary intercalation compound, Ca-G4·C72. Mass/volume changes during Ca-G4 intercalation and the evolution of in operando X-ray diffraction studies both suggest that Ca-G4 intercalation results in the formation of an intermediate phase between stage-III and stage-II with a gallery height of 11.41 Å. Density functional theory calculations also reveal that the most stable conformation of Ca-G4 has a planar structure with Ca2+ surrounded by G4, which eventually forms a double stack that aligns with graphene layers after intercalation. Despite large dimensional changes during charge/discharge (C/D), both rate performance and cyclic stability are excellent. Graphite retains a substantial capacity at high C/D rates (e.g., 47 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 s vs 62 mAh g−1 at 0.05 A g−1) and shows no capacity decay during as many as 2000 C/D cycles. As the first Ca2+-shuttling calcium-ion batteries with a graphite anode, a full-cell is constructed by coupling with an organic cathode and its electrochemical performance is presented.},

ABSTRACT={In the field of secondary batteries, the growing diversity of possible applications for energy storage has led to the investigation of numerous alternative systems to the state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery. Metal-air batteries are one such technology, due to promising specific energies that could reach beyond the theoretical maximum of lithium-ion. Much focus over the past decade has been on lithium and sodium-air, and, only in recent years, efforts have been stepped up in the study of divalent metal-air batteries. Within this article, the opportunities, progress, and challenges in nonaqueous rechargeable magnesium and calcium-air batteries will be examined and critically reviewed. In particular, attention will be focused on the electrolyte development for reversible metal deposition and the positive electrode chemistries (frequently referred to as the “air cathode”). Synergies between two cell chemistries will be described, along with the present impediments required to be overcome. Scientific advances in understanding fundamental cell (electro)chemistry and electrolyte development are crucial to surmount these barriers in order to edge these technologies toward practical application.}

While the Ca anode is often described as being surface film-controlled, the ability to access reversible Ca electrochemistry is highly electrolyte-dependent in general, which affects both interfacial chemistry on plated Ca along with more fundamental Ca2+/Ca redox properties. This minireview describes recent progress towards a reversible Ca anode from the point of view of the most successful electrolyte chemistries identified to date. This includes, centrally, what is currently known about the Ca2+ solvation environment in these systems. Experimental (physico-chemical and spectroscopy) and computational results are summarized for the two major solvent classes – carbonates and ethers – that have yielded promising results so far. Current knowledge gaps and opportunities to improve fundamental understanding of Ca2+/Ca redox are also identified.},

Herein, the calcium deposition/stripping behaviors of a calcium salt electrolyte, Ca[B(hfip)4]2 ([B(hfip)4]−=tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate) were systematically studied using different working electrodes (GC, Pt, Cu, and Al) and different solvents including tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethoxyethane (DME), and diglyme (DGM). It was found that the Ca[B(hfip)4]2/DGM electrolyte demonstrated the highest reversibility and stability in cyclic voltammetry and symmetric Ca/Ca half-cell studies. The Ca[B(hfip)4]2/DGM electrolyte was further employed to demonstrate a 3.4 V Ca battery using a FePO4 cathode with a discharge capacity of 120 Ah/mg.},

However, challenges, such as Ca metal passivation by electrolytes and a lack of cathode materials with efficient Ca2+ storage capabilities, impede the development of practical Ca metal batteries. To overcome these limitations, the applicability of a CuS cathode in Ca metal batteries and its electrochemical properties are verified herein. Ex situ spectroscopy and electron microscopy results show that a CuS cathode comprising nanoparticles that are well dispersed in a high-surface-area carbon matrix can serve as an effective cathode for Ca2+ storage via the conversion reaction. This optimally functioning cathode is coupled with a tailored, weakly coordinating monocarborane-anion electrolyte, namely, Ca(CB11H12)2 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane/tetrahydrofuran, which enables reversible Ca plating/stripping at room temperature. The combination affords a Ca metal battery with a long cycle life of over 500 cycles and capacity retention of 92\% based on the capacity of the 10th cycle. This study confirms the feasibility of the long-term operation of Ca metal anodes and can expedite the development of Ca metal batteries.},

Here, we report a CIB that can work stably at room temperature in a new cell configuration using graphite as the cathode and tin foils as the anode as well as the current collector. This CIB operates on a highly reversible electrochemical reaction that combines hexafluorophosphate intercalation/de-intercalation at the cathode and a Ca-involved alloying/de-alloying reaction at the anode.

These advances permit the prediction of peculiar character in the ion profiles at electrode potentials near the redox level, exploration of the electrochemical stability of the interface, and differentiation between the mechanisms of electron and ion transport and associated time scales. The developed methodology enables us to self-consistently determine the fundamental limits for a microscopic description of biased interfaces, in terms characteristic sizes and time scales of relevant processes, within atomistic and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.}

The model enables a description of multicomponent phases at interfaces and includes the effects of specific non-electrostatic interactions (specific adsorption), ion size disparity, and the explicit presence of neutral species. In addition to the optimization of electrostatic, non-electrostatic, and steric forces, the model can be easily modified to explore the effects of other channels for equilibration, including local chemical transformations driven by equilibrium constants and electrochemical reactions driven by the electrode potential. In this way, we show that, upon accounting for these effects, local speciation in the vicinity of the interface can be drastically different from what is expected from restricted models and minor species (from the bulk perspective) may become dominant due to the effects of local pH. We evaluate the ionic contribution to the surface tension at the interface and show how this could impact the structure of air/liquid interfaces. On the same footing, an attempt to describe electrochemical metal dissolution is made. The model allows estimates of the mutual population of newly produced ions depending on their charge and size and could be useful for interpretation of electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements if the dissolution involves different metal ions (species). With these advances, the proposed model may be used as an ingredient within a hybrid ab initio-continuum methodology to model biased interfaces.}",

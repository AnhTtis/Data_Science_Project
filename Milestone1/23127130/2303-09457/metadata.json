    "abstract": "In this work we study, theoretically, electronic mobility of the silicon carbide semiconductor in the 3C phase, named 3C-SiC. 3C-SiC has shown great potential for applications in extreme conditions. Thus, the study of the electronic mobility of this semiconductor is of great interest. In this work were theoretically deduced: drift velocity, displacement and mobility of the charge carriers in the n-type doped 3C-SiC semiconductor, subjected to a constant electric field. The dependence of these transport properties as a function of the intensity of the electric field and temperature was analyzed. For this, a differential equation of motion was used with a source term (low intensity electric fields) and a term of resistance to movement (electrical resistance).",

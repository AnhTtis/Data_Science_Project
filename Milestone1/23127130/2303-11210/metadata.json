    "abstract": "This paper deals with the micro-macro derivation of models from the underlying description provided by methods of the kinetic theory for active particles. We consider the so-called exotic models according to the definition proposed in in [9]. The first part of the presentation focuses on a survey and a critical analysis of some phenomenological models known in the literature. We refer to a selection of case studies, in detail: transport of virus models, social dynamics, and Keller-Segel in a fluid. The second part shows how an Hilbert type approach can be developed to derive models at the macroscale from the underlying description provided by the kinetic theory of active particles. The third part deals with the derivation of macroscopic models corresponding to the selected case studies. Finally, a forward look into the future research perspectives is proposed.",

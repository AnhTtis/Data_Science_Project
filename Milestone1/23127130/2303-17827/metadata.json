    "abstract": "Consider a stationary Poisson process of horospheres in a $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space. In the focus of this note is the total surface area these random horospheres induce in a sequence of balls of growing radius $R$. The main result is a quantitative, non-standard central limit theorem for these random variables as the radius $R$ of the balls and the space dimension $d$ tend to infinity simultaneously.",

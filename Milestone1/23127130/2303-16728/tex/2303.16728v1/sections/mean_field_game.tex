Consider the following canonical space
\begin{equation}\label{mf:canonical_space}
    \Omega^*=\R^d \times \contrd, \quad \F^*=\boreliani{\R^d} \otimes \boreliani{\contrd},\quad \prob^*=\nu\otimes\wienermeasure.
\end{equation}
Define $\xi$ and $W=(W_t)_{t \in [0,T]}$ as
\begin{equation}
    \xi(\omega_*)=\xi(x,w)=x, \quad W_t(\omega_*)=W_t(x,w)=w_t.
\end{equation}
By definition of $\prob^*$, $\xi$ and $W$ are independent, $\xi$ is an $\R^d$-valued random variable with law $\nu$ and $W$ is a standard Brownian motion.
Define the filtration $\mathbb{F}^*$ as the $\prob^*$-augmentation of the filtration generated by $\xi$ and $W$.

\bigskip
Consider the set $\A$ of $\mathbb{F}^*$-progressively measurable processes taking values in $A$:
\begin{equation}\label{mf:strategie_open_loop}
    \A = \insieme{\alpha:[0,T]\times\Omega^*\to A \; \Big\vert \;  \text{$\alpha$ is $\mathbb{F}^*$-progressively measurable } }.
\end{equation}
Provided that we identify processes which are equal $Leb_{[0,T]}\otimes\prob^*$-a.e., we can regard $\A$ as
\begin{equation*}
    \A=L^2 \tonde{[0,T]\times\Omega^*,\mathcal{P}^*,Leb_{[0,T]} \otimes \prob^*;A},
    \end{equation*}
where $\mathcal{P}^*$ stands for the progressive $\sigma$-algebra on $[0,T]\times\Omega^*$, using the filtration $\mathbb{F}^*$.
We call any element $\alpha\in\A$ an open loop strategy for the mean field game.
We endow such a space $\A$ with the norm
\begin{equation}\label{mf:semi_norm}
    \norm{\alpha}_{L^2}=\E^{\prob^*}\quadre{\int_0^T \abs{\alpha_t}^2 dt}^\frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}
and consider the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\boreliani{\A}$ associated to that.
We observe that, since $([0,T]\times\Omega^*,\boreliani{[0,T]\times\Omega^*})$ is Polish and $A$ is closed, $\A$ is a separable Banach space.
Finally, we will make no distinction between an $\mathbb{F}^*$-progressively measurable process $\alpha$ and any other process $\alpha'$ which is equal to it $Leb_{[0,T]}\otimes\prob^*$-almost everywhere.

\begin{definition}[Admissible recommendation for the mean field game]\label{mf:admissible_recommendation}
We call \emph{admissible recommendation} a pair $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda)$ where:
\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item $(\Omega^0,\mathcal{F}^{0-}$, $\prob^0)$ is a complete probability space; $\Omega^0$ is a Polish space and $\F^{0-}$ is its corresponding Borel $\sigma$-algebra.

    \item $\Lambda$ is a random variable with values in $\A$:
    \begin{equation}\label{mf:raccomandazione}
    \begin{aligned}
    \Lambda: (\Omega^0,\mathcal{F}^{0-},\prob^0) & \longrightarrow (\A,\boreliani{\A}) \\
    \omega_0 & \longmapsto \Lambda(\omega_0)=\alpha:[0,T]\times\Omega^*\to A.
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

    \item \label{mf:condizione_ammissibilita} $\Lambda$ is admissible, in the following sense: let $(\Omega,\F,\prob)$ be the product space of $(\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0)$ and $(\Omega^*,\F^*,\prob^*)$:
    \begin{equation*}
        (\Omega,\F,\prob)= (\Omega^0 \times \Omega^*,\F^{0-}\otimes\F^*,\prob^0\otimes\prob^*).
    \end{equation*}
    We complete the $\sigma$-algebra $\F$ with the $\prob$-null sets and endow the product probability space with the $\prob$-augmentation of the filtration
    \begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{F}= \F^{0-} \otimes \mathbb{F}^* = (\F^{0-}\otimes\F^*_t)_{t\in[0,T]}.
    \end{equation*}
    Given an $(\A,\boreliani{\A})$-valued random variable $\Lambda$ as in \eqref{mf:raccomandazione}, we say that $\Lambda$ is admissible if there exists an $A$-valued process $\lambda=(\lambda_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$, defined on $(\Omega,\F,\prob)$ and $\mathbb{F}$-progressively measurable, so that, for $\prob^0$-a.e. $\omega_0 \in \Omega^0$, the section $(\lambda_t(\omega_0,\cdot))_{t \in [0,T]}$ is equal to $\Lambda(\omega_0)$ in $\A$:
    \begin{equation}\label{mf:uguaglianza_ammissibilita}
        \norm{(\lambda_t(\omega_0,\cdot))_{t \in [0,T]}-\Lambda(\omega_0)}_{L^2([0,T] \times \Omega^*)}=0, \quad \prob^0\text{-a.s.}
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
If $\Lambda$ is an admissible recommendation, we write
\begin{equation}\label{mf:controllo_indotto}
    \lambda_t(\omega)= \lambda_t(\omega_0,\omega_*)=\Lambda(\omega_0)_t(\omega_*),
\end{equation}
where equality is to be understood in the sense of \eqref{mf:uguaglianza_ammissibilita}.
We call \emph{strategy associated to the admissible recommendation} $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda)$ the $\mathbb{F}$-progressively measurable process $\lambda=(\lambda_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ satisfying \eqref{mf:controllo_indotto}.
\end{definition}
We remark that, by Proposition \ref{esempi:unicita_strategia_associata}, given any admissible recommendation $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda)$, the strategy $\lambda$ associated to it is unique $Leb_{[0,T]}\otimes\prob$-almost everywhere.

\begin{definition}[Correlated flow]\label{def_correlated_flow}
A \emph{correlated flow} is a triple $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda,\mu)$ where:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda)$ is an admissible recommendation.

    \item $\mu:(\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0)\to (\contpdue,\boreliani{\contpdue})$ is a random continuous flow of measures with values in $\mathcal{P}^2(\R^d)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
The same considerations as in Remark \ref{finite_players:remark_estensioni} about the extension of random variables on the product space $(\Omega,\F,\prob)$ hold for correlated flows as well.

\bigskip
Let $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda,\mu)$ be a correlated flow.
On the product probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\prob)$ defined at point \ref{mf:condizione_ammissibilita} of Definition \ref{mf:admissible_recommendation}, we assign state dynamics.
If the representative player decides to play according to the admissible recommendation $\Lambda$, the dynamics is given by the following SDE:
\begin{equation}\label{dinamica_MF_no_deviazione}
    \begin{cases}
    dX_t = b(t,X_t,\mu_t,\lambda_t)dt +dW_t, \qquad  0\leq t \leq T, \\
    X_0 = \xi.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
If instead the representative player decides to ignore the mediator's recommendation and to use a possibly different strategy $\beta\in\A$, the dynamics is given by the following SDE:
\begin{equation}\label{dinamica_MF_deviation}
    \begin{cases}
    dX_t = b(t,X_t,\mu_t,\beta_t)dt +dW_t, \qquad 0\leq t \leq T, \\
    X_0 = \xi.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
By Assumptions \ref{standing_assumptions}, on any space $(\Omega,\F,\mathbb{F},\prob)$ there exists a solution to equation \eqref{dinamica_MF_no_deviazione} and pathwise uniqueness holds.
By Theorem \ref{teorema_di_unicita_legge}, uniqueness in law holds.
Analogous considerations apply to equation \eqref{dinamica_MF_deviation}.


\begin{remark}\label{mf:remark_pedante}
As in Remarks \ref{finite_players:remark_estensioni} and \ref{finite_players:remark_pedante}, we can further stress the dependence upon $\omega=(\omega_0,\omega_*) \in \Omega^0\times\Omega^*=\Omega$: If the player implements the recommendation, we rewrite \eqref{dinamica_MF_no_deviazione} as
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{cases}
    dX_t(\omega_0,\omega_*) = b(t,X_t(\omega_0,\omega_*),\mu_t(\omega_0),\lambda_t(\omega_0,\omega_*))dt +dW_t(\omega_*), \\
    X_0(\omega_0,\omega_*) = \xi(\omega_*),
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
for $\lambda_t(\omega_0,\omega_*)=(\Lambda(\omega_0))_t(\omega_*)$, where equality is meant in the sense of \eqref{mf:uguaglianza_ammissibilita}.
If the representative player deviates, we write instead
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{cases}
    dX_t(\omega_0,\omega_*) = b(t,X_t(\omega_0,\omega_*),\mu_t(\omega_0),\beta_t(\omega_*))dt +dW_t(\omega_*), \\
    X_0(\omega_0,\omega_*) = \xi(\omega_*).
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\end{remark}

\bigskip
Let $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda,\mu)$ be a correlated flow.
The cost functionals for the representative player and the deviating player, whose state dynamics follow \eqref{dinamica_MF_no_deviazione} and \eqref{dinamica_MF_deviation}, respectively, are given by:
\begin{equation}\label{costi_mfg}
\begin{aligned}
    & \J(\Lambda,\mu)=\E\quadre{\int_0^T f(t,X_t,\mu_t,\lambda_t)dt + g(X_T,\mu_T)}, \\
    & \J(\beta,\mu)=\E\quadre{\int_0^T f(t,X_t,\mu_t,\beta_t)dt + g(X_T,\mu_T)}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Finally, we give the definition of coarse correlated solution of the mean field game:
\begin{definition}[Coarse correlated solution]\label{def_mean_field_sol}
A correlated flow $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda,\mu)$ is a \emph{coarse correlated solution} of the mean field game if the following properties hold:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Optimality: for every deviation $\beta \in \A$, it holds
    \begin{equation}\label{def_mean_field_sol:opt}
        \J(\Lambda,\mu)\leq \J(\beta,\mu).
    \end{equation}
    \item Consistency: for every time $t \in [0,T]$, $\mu_t$ is a version of the conditional law of $X_t$ given $\mu$, that is,
    \begin{equation}\label{def_mean_field_sol:cons}
        \mu_t(\cdot)=\prob(X_t \in\cdot \; \vert \; \mu ) \quad \prob\text{-a.s.} \;\; \forall t \in [0,T].
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
We will refer to coarse correlated solutions of the mean field game as coarse correlated mean field solutions and mean field coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) as well.
\end{definition}

As in \cite{bonesiniCE} and \cite{campifischer2021}, the consistency condition \eqref{def_mean_field_sol:cons} should be read in the following way: the mediator imagines what the flow of measures will be, up to the terminal horizon $T$, before the game starts, and gives a recommendation to each player according to his idea.
If all players commit to the mediator's lottery for generating recommendations before having been informed of the actual outcomes, then the flow of measures should arise from aggregation of the individual behaviors. 
This interpretation sheds light on the measurability requirement of both $\Lambda$ and $\mu$:
since the recommendation is given before the beginning of the game and it is formulated on the mediator's idea about the future flow of measures, it is natural to require $\mu$ to be measurable with respect to $\F^{0-}$, as $\Lambda$ is so.
Moreover, in general, the recommendation $\Lambda$ and $\mu$ are not mutually independent: since the flow of measures $\mu$ should be thought of as the limit point of the $N$-player empirical measure $\mu^N$ defined by \eqref{misura_empirica} and, analogously, the recommendation $\Lambda$ should be the limit point to the recommendations given to any of the players in the $N$-player game, some mutual dependency between them should be expected.
Regarding the strategy of the deviating player, as in the $N$-player game, if the player deviates, she chooses her strategy on her own, without using any of the information carried by $\Lambda$ or $\mu$:
the only information she has about $\Lambda$ or $\mu$ comes from the knowledge of the distribution $\prob^0$, which is assumed to be known by the representative player, in analogy to the $N$-player game.

\begin{remark}[Role of $(\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0)$]
Analogously as in the $N$-player game, although the probability space $(\Omega^0,\mathcal{F}^{0-},\prob^0)$ is part of the definitions of admissible recommendation and correlated flow, when it is clear from the context we refer to $\Lambda$ and $(\Lambda,\mu)$, instead of the pair $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda)$ and the triple $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda,\mu)$, as admissible recommendation and correlated flow, respectively.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}[Expressing mean field CCEs in terms of the law of the correlated flow]\label{mf:remark_condizione_integrale}
Let $(\Lambda,\mu)$ be a mean field CCE.
Denote by $\gamma \in \probmeasures{\A \times \contpdue}$ the joint law of $(\Lambda,\mu)$ and by $\rho \in \probmeasures{\contpdue}$ the marginal law of $\mu$.
Since both $(\Omega^0,\F^{0-})$ and $(\Omega^1,\F^1)$ are Polish spaces, so are $\A$ and $(\Omega,\F)$, so that there exist a version of the regular conditional probability of $\prob$ given $(\Lambda,\mu)=(\alpha,m)$, which we denote by $\prob^{\alpha,m}$.
By conditioning on $\sigma(\Lambda,\mu)$, we get that $X$ is a solution to the SDE
\begin{equation}\label{es_eq_deterministica}
    \begin{cases}
    dX_t = b(t,X_t,m_t,\alpha_t)dt +dW_t, \qquad 0 \leq t \leq T, \\
    X_0 = 0,
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
on the probability space $(\Omega,\F,\prob^{\alpha,m})$, for $\gamma$-a.e. $(\alpha,m) \in \A \times \contpdue$.
To see this, observe that $W$ is an $\mathbb{F}$-Brownian motion under $\prob^{\alpha,m}$ as well, since by construction $W$ and $(\Lambda,\mu)$ are independent under $\prob$, and it obviously holds $\prob^{\alpha,m}(\Lambda=\alpha,\mu=m)=1$, which implies
\begin{equation*}
    \prob^{\alpha,m} \tonde{b(t,x,\mu_t,\lambda_t)= b(t,x,m_t,\alpha_t), \; \forall x \in \R}=1, \: Leb_{[0,T]}\text{-a.e. } t \in [0,T],
\end{equation*}
for $\gamma$-a.e. $(\alpha,m) \in \A \times \contpdue$.
This is enough to conclude that $X$ satisfies equation \eqref{es_eq_deterministica} under $\prob^{\alpha,m}$ and that the equality
\begin{equation*}
    \J(\Lambda,\mu)=\int_{\A \times \probmeasures{\contrd} }\J(\alpha,m)\gamma(d\alpha,dm),
\end{equation*}
holds.
Here, $\J(\alpha,m)$ stands for the cost functional associated to a correlated flow $(\Lambda,\mu)$ 
$\prob^0$-a.s. equal to $(\alpha,m) \in \A \times \contpdue$.
Analogous reasoning holds for $\J(\beta,\mu)$, except that the conditioning on $\sigma(\Lambda,\mu)$ does not modify the dependence upon the deviating strategy $\beta \in \A$.
Therefore, the optimality condition \eqref{def_mean_field_sol:opt} reads as
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\A \times \contpdue} \J(\alpha,m) \gamma(d\alpha,dm) \leq \int_{\contpdue} \J(\alpha,\beta) \rho(dm),
\end{equation}
for all $\beta \in \A$. Comparing this inequality with \eqref{finite_players:condizione_integrale}, we observe that the dependence upon the non-deviating players in the left hand-side of \eqref{finite_players:condizione_integrale} is replaced by the law of the flow of measures $\mu$, which captures the behavior of the population.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[Admissible recommendations]\label{mf:example:admissible_recommendations}
Fix a complete probability space $(\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0)$.
We provide some simple examples of random variables $\Lambda:(\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0) \to (\A,\boreliani{\A})$ which are admissible recommendations in the sense of Definition \ref{mf:admissible_recommendation}.

\begin{enumerate}[wide]
\item \label{mf:example:finitely_many_values}
Suppose that $\Lambda$ takes only finitely many values, say $\alpha^1,\dots,\alpha^k \in \A$, $k \geq 1$, i.e. $\prob^0(\Lambda=\alpha^i)=p_i$, with $p_i \geq 0$ for every $i=1,\dots,k$, $\sum_{i=1}^k p_i=1$.
We can easily define the associated strategy $(\lambda_t)_{t \in [0,T]}$ as
\begin{equation*}
    \lambda_t(\omega_0,\omega_*)=\sum_{i=1}^k \1_{\insieme{\Lambda=\alpha^i}}(\omega_0)\alpha^i_t(\omega_*).
\end{equation*}
We explicit the dependence upon the scenario $\omega=(\omega_0,\omega_*)$:
\begin{equation*}
    \Lambda(\omega_0)_t(\omega_*) = \sum_{i=1}^k \1_{\insieme{\alpha^i}}(\Lambda(\omega_0))\alpha^i_t(\omega_*).
\end{equation*}
By the same line of reasoning of Remark \ref{finite_players:remark_estensioni}, we have that this process is $\mathbb{F}$-progressively measurable, since the processes $\alpha^i$, $i=1,\dots,k$, are $\mathbb{F}$-progressively measurable and the $\F^{0-}$-measurable real-valued random variables $\1_{\{\alpha^1\}}(\Lambda(\omega_0))$ can be regarded as defined on the product space $\Omega^0\times\Omega^*$ and $\F^{0-}\otimes \{\emptyset, \Omega^*\}$-measurable, therefore $\mathbb{F}$-progressively measurable.
Finally, condition \eqref{mf:uguaglianza_ammissibilita} is satisfied by $\lambda$ itself.

\item Suppose $\Lambda$ takes at most countably many values.
We can define $\lambda=(\lambda_t(\omega_0,\omega_*))_{t \in [0,T]}$ as
\begin{equation*}
    \lambda_t(\omega_0,\omega_*)= \sum_{i=1}^\infty\1_{\insieme{\Lambda=\alpha^i}}(\omega_0)\alpha^i_t(\omega_*).
\end{equation*}
Set $\lambda^n_t(\omega_0,\omega_*)=\sum_{i=1}^n \1_{\{\Lambda=\alpha^i\}}(\omega_0)\alpha^i_t(\omega_*)$ and observe that, by the same argument of the previous point, $\lambda^n_t$ is an $\mathbb{F}$-progressively measurable process for each $n\geq 1$.
Furthermore, for each $(t,\omega_0,\omega_*) \in [0,T]\times\Omega^0\times\Omega^*$, the sequence $\lambda^n_t(\omega_0,\omega_*)$ is eventually constant, being $(\{\Lambda=\alpha^i\})_{i\geq 1}$ a partition of $\Omega^0$.
Therefore, the sequence $\lambda^n$ converges pointwise to $\lambda=(\lambda_t)_{t \in [0,T]}$.
Being $\lambda$ the pointwise limit of $\lambda^n$, we deduce that $\lambda$ is a progressively measurable process with values in $A$ which satisfies \eqref{mf:uguaglianza_ammissibilita}, so that $\Lambda$ is admissible.

\item Let $(\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0)$ be a complete probability space, with $\Omega^0$ Polish and $\F^{0-}$ the corresponding Borel $\sigma$-algebra, and let $(\lambda_t)_{t \in [0,T]}$ be an $A$-valued process defined on the $\prob^0\otimes\prob^*$-completion of the product space $(\Omega^0\times\Omega^*,\F^{0-}\otimes\F,\prob^0\otimes\prob^*)$ with values in $A$.
Assume that it is progressively measurable with respect to the $\prob^0\otimes\prob^*$-augmentation of the filtration $\mathbb{F}=(\F^{0-}\otimes\F^*_t)_{t \in [0,T]}$.
We can define a function $\Lambda:\Omega^0\to \A$ by setting
\begin{equation}\label{raccomandazione_indotta}
\begin{aligned}
    \Lambda(\omega_0)=\left \{ \: \begin{aligned}
        & \begin{aligned}
            (\lambda_{t}(\omega_0,\cdot))_{t \in [0,T]} &  :\space [0,T] \times \Omega^* \to A \\
        & (t,\omega_*) \to \lambda_t(\omega_0,\omega_*), 
        \end{aligned} &&  \omega^0 \in \Omega^0\setminus N, \\ 
        & a_0 && \omega_0 \in N.
    \end{aligned} \right.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $N\subset \Omega^0$ is a $\prob^0$-null set and $a_0$ is an arbitrary point in $A$.
By Lemma \ref{esempi:lemma_misurabile} in Appendix \ref{appendix_recommendations}, the pair $((\Omega^0,\F^{0-},\prob^0),\Lambda)$ is an admissible recommendation, with strategy associated to the recommendation $\Lambda$ given by the process $\lambda$ itself.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

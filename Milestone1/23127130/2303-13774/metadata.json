    "abstract": "In this work, we systematically study the OZI-allowed two-body strong decay properties of $1P$- and $1D$-wave $Σ_c$ baryons within the $j $-$j$ coupling scheme in the framework of the quark pair creation model. For a comparison, we also give the predictions of the chiral quark model. Some model dependencies can be found in the predictions of two models. The calculations indicate that: (i) The $1P$-wave $λ$-mode $Σ_c$ states most likely to be relatively narrow states with a width of $Γ<80$ MeV. Their main decay channels are $Λ_cπ$, or $Σ_cπ$, or $Σ_c^*π$. The $1P$-wave $ρ$-mode states most might be broad states with a width of $Γ\\sim 100-200$ MeV. They dominantly decay into $Σ_cπ$ and $Σ_c^*π$ channels. Some evidences of these $1P$-wave states are most likely to be observed in the $Λ_cπ$ and $Λ_cππ$ invariant mass spectra around the energy range of $2.75-2.95$ GeV. (ii) The $1D$-wave $λ$-mode $Σ_c$ excitations may be moderate states with a width of about dozens of MeV. The $1D$-wave $λ$-mode states mainly decay into the $1P$-wave charmed baryon via the pionic decay processes. Meanwhile, several $1D$-wave $λ$-mode states have significant decay rates into $DN$ or $D^*N$. Hence, the $DN$ and $D^*N$ are likely to be interesting channels for experimental exploration. (iii) Furthermore, the two $1D$-wave $ρ$-mode excitations $Σ_c|J^P=5/2^+,3\\rangle_{ρρ}$ and $|J^P=7/2^+,3\\rangle_{ρρ}$ are most likely to be fairly narrow state with a width of dozens of MeV, and they mainly decay into $Λ_cπ$. Some evidences of them might be observed in the $Λ_cπ$ invariant mass spectra around the energy range of $3.1-3.2$ GeV.",

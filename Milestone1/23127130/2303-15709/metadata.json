    "abstract": "The type II seesaw leptogenesis simultaneously explains the origin of neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of our universe, and the inflation. The large hadron collider(LHC) provides an opportunity to directly test the type II seesaw leptogenesis by looking for the predicted triplet Higgs. In this paper, we perform an analysis of the detection prospect for the triplet Higgs at the LHC through the multi-lepton channels. We find that due to the contribution of $pp\\to H^{\\pm \\pm }H^{\\mp }$ process, the sensitivity of multi-lepton channels searching for the doubly-charged Higgs pair production can be improved. We also investigate the $3l+ {E}^{\\rm miss}_{\\rm T}$ signals to probe the $pp\\to H^{\\pm \\pm }H^{\\mp }$ production and find that the future high luminosity LHC could probe a triplet Higgs around 1.2 TeV at $2σ$ level.",

   \caption{Overview of our methodology. In phase-1 (top), we train a VOS model (\textit{i.e.} STCN) which takes a triplet of frames as input on a two-shot VOS dataset in a semi-supervised manner. We constrain the reference (first) frame to be a labeled frame to ease the learning. 
   The remaining frames can be either labeled or unlabeled. 
   Then we perform an intermediate inference (middle) to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled frames by the VOS model trained in phase-1, and construct a pseudo-label bank to store the pseudo labels in addition to the ground-truth.
   In phase-2 (bottom), we re-train a VOS model—which could be most models—on the combination of labeled and pseudo-labeled data without any restrictions on the first frame. The pseudo-label bank is dynamically updated once more reliable pseudo labels are identified during phase-2 training.}

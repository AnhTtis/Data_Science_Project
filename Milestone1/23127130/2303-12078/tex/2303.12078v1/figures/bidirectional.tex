  \caption{Illustration of unidirectional inference \textit{vs}. bidirectional inference. It is obvious that using labeled frame $15$ to infer unlabeled frame $105$ lead to poor mask prediction due to the accumulation error of feature propagation. Instead, using labeled frame $110$ to infer unlabeled frame $105$ in a reverse direction can obtain better results, which is more suitable for initializing the label bank.}

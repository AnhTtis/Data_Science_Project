    "abstract": "We prove the existence of a $B$-continuous viscosity solution for a class of infinite dimensional semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs) using probabilistic methods. Our approach also yields a stochastic representation formula for the solution in terms of a scalar-valued backward stochastic differential equation. The uniqueness is proved under additional assumptions using a comparison theorem for viscosity solutions. Our results constitute the first nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula using the notion of $B$-continuous viscosity solutions and thus introduces a framework allowing for generalizations to the case of fully nonlinear PDEs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we establish a weighted Adams' inequality in some appropriate weighted Sobolev space in $\\mathbb{R}^4$. Then we give an improvement inequality by proving the concentration-compactness result. In the last part, we consider an application to elliptic equation involving new exponential growth at infinity in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.",

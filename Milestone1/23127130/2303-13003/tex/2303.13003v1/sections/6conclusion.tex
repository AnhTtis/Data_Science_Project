\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have introduced the concept of reliability in the context of post-training quantization and have proposed an approach to assess the reliability of PTQ. 
We have explored the impact of various factors on the reliability of PTQ, including the three main steps of the PTQ workflow: calibration dataset construction, quantization settings assignment, and quantization parameter optimization.
Furthermore, we have proposed a standardized framework for evaluating the reliability of PTQ on different neural networks, which can aid future research in this area.
Nevertheless, further investigation is necessary to fully comprehend the reliability of PTQ.

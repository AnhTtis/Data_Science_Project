\section{Factors Affect PTQ Reliability}

In the preceding section, we propose an approach to assess the reliability of PTQ. 
Subsequently, we aim to examine how different factors involved in the quantization workflow impact the reliability of PTQ. 
To achieve this goal, we will conduct a series of tests on each step of PTQ workflow, including calibration dataset construction, quantization settings, and optimization of quantization parameters.

% In the previous section, we propose a method for evaluating reliability of PTQ. 
% Next, we will investigate how various factors in the quantization process affect reliability.
% We will conduct separate tests to investigate the influence of each step in the PTQ workflow: calibration dataset construction, quantization settings, and quantization parameters optimizing.

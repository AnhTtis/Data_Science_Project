\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, 
we propose using the image foundation model as the unmasked teacher for masked video modeling.
Besides,
we present a progressive pre-training framework for building environmentally friendly video foundation models,
which handles both scene-related and temporal-related actions, 
as well as complex video-language understanding. 
We hope that our simple, scalable, and reproducible framework will facilitate further research on video foundation models for future AI systems.

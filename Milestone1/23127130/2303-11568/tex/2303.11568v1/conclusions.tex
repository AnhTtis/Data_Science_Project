\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

As opportunities always come with risks, the development and deployment of large AI models in biomedical and healthcare settings require more prudence. Joint efforts from domain experts and feedback from users are critical for the safe and ethical function of large AI models. Given the trajectories of AI model development and applications, large foundation AI models will soon have a significant influence on the field of biomedical and health informatics at large. With their wide knowledge spectrum and strengthened reasoning and generative capability, we conjecture that large medical AI models will assist and enable the delivery of precision healthcare, advance future medical discovery, provide innovative medical education, create productive clinical workflow, and many more beyond in this thriving field.

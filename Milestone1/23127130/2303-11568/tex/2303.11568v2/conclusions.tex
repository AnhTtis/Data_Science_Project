\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We highlight an ongoing paradigm shift within AI community, which is fostering large AI models for transforming different biomedical and health sectors. The new paradigm aims to learn a \textbf{versatile} foundation model on a large-scale (multi-modal) dataset covering \textbf{varied data distributions and learning tasks}. Boundaries between different intelligent tasks, and even between different data modalities, are being dismantled. With generalist intelligence and more unknown capabilities activated, we believe large AI models will augment, instead of replacing, medical professionals and practitioners in the future. Human-AI cooperation will become pervasive. In this regard, the development of large AI models requires even closer and more intense collaboration between domain experts, as well as gradually established regulations.

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we introduce the MAPSeg framework as a unified UDA framework that works on centralized, federated, and test-time UDA scenarios. We evaluate it under multiple domain shift and adaptation settings, and it outperforms all the baselines in all scenarios.
We conduct extensive ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component.

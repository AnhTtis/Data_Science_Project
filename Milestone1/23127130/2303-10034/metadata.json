    "abstract": "This paper describes the shortest path problem in weighted graphs and examines the differences in efficiency that occur when using Dijkstra's algorithm with a Fibonacci heap, binary heap, and self-balancing binary tree. Using C++ implementations of these algorithm variants, we find that the fastest method is not always the one that has the lowest asymptotic complexity. Reasons for this are discussed and backed with empirical evidence.",

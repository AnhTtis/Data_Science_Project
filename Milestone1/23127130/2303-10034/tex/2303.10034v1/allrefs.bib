This model is an extension of that used in the first timetabling competition, and we discuss the rationales behind these extensions. We also describe in detail the criteria that are used for judging solution quality and discuss other issues that are related to this. Finally we go over some of the strengths and limitations of the model. This paper can be regarded as the official documentation for track-two of the timetabling competition.},

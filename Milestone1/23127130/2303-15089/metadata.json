    "abstract": "In this manuscript, a fluid model is utilized to calculate the density of plasma species assuming geometrically symmetric Ar/CF4 Radiofrequency Capacitively Coupled Plasmas. The electrodes are driven by a sinusoidal waefront with an amplitude of 200 V and a frequency of 13.56 MHz. The gap between the electrodes is 5cm. The plasma species density is calculated as a function of the gas pressure, electron temperature, and the gas composition. In a good agreement with recent experimental results, $CF^+_3$ and F are dominant for all considered simulation parameters. The results explain the pathways to perform atomic layer etching and nanolayer deposition processes. In order to reveal the effect of electron heating on the discharge dynamics, The spatiotemporal electron energy equation is coupled to the fluid model. Tailoring the driven potential has been found to control the concentration of some plasma species. When the plasma is driven with the fundamental frequency, Ohmic and stochastic heating allows electrons to be heated symmetrically. Higher harmonics give rise to an electrical asymmetry and electron heating asymmetry between the powered and grounded sheaths. The electron temperature depends on the driven harmonics; it adjusts gain and loss rates and some plasma species densities.",

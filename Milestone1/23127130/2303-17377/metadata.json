    "abstract": "In this work we shall obtain sufficient conditions for the appearance of singularities in gravitational theories which propagate an extra vector degree of freedom, based on the known relaxations of the singularity theorems. We study the cases of a general Proca field and a vector theory with stable self-derivative interactions. In this study we show several cases of singularities that usually would be considered as potentially singularity-free, since they violate the usual point-like energy conditions.",

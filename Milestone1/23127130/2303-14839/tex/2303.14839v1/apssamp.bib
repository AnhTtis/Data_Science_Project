journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
abstract = {Quantum chaos of many-body (MB) systems has been swiftly developing into a vibrant research area at the interface between various disciplines, ranging from statistical physics to condensed matter to quantum information and to cosmology. In quantum systems with a classical limit, advanced semiclassical methods provide the crucial link between classically chaotic dynamics and corresponding universal features at the quantum level. Recently, single-particle (SP) techniques dealing with ergodic wave interference in the usual semiclassical limit  have begun to be transformed into the field theoretical domain of N-particle systems in the analogous semiclassical limit , thereby accounting for genuine MB quantum interference. This semiclassical MB theory provides a unified framework for understanding random-matrix correlations of both SP and MB quantum chaotic systems. Certain braided bundles of classical orbits, and of mean field modes, govern interference, respectively, and provide the key to the foundation of universality. Case studies presented include an MB version of Gutzwiller’s trace formula for the spectral density and out-of-time-order correlators along with brief remarks on where further progress may be forthcoming.}

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Out-of-time ordered (OTO) correlation functions describe scrambling of information in correlated quantum matter. They are of particular interest in incoherent quantum systems lacking well defined quasi-particles. Thus far, it is largely elusive how OTO correlators spread in incoherent systems with diffusive transport governed by a few globally conserved quantities. Here, we study the dynamical response of such a system using high-performance matrix-product-operator techniques. Specifically, we consider the non-integrable, one-dimensional Bose–Hubbard model in the incoherent high-temperature regime. Our system exhibits diffusive dynamics in time-ordered correlators of globally conserved quantities, whereas OTO correlators display a ballistic, light-cone spreading of quantum information. The slowest process in the global thermalization of the system is thus diffusive, yet information spreading is not inhibited by such slow dynamics. We furthermore develop an experimentally feasible protocol to overcome some challenges faced by existing proposals and to probe time-ordered and OTO correlation functions. Our study opens new avenues for both the theoretical and experimental exploration of thermalization and information scrambling dynamics.}

The ideas and methods of semiclassical physics presented in this thesis provide a systematic road to address non-perturbative regimes, where classical information find its way into the description of quantum properties of systems of few to many interacting particles.

The first part of the thesis provides a semiclassical description of few-particle systems using cluster expansions and novel analytic results for short-range interacting bosons in one and three dimensions are derived. In the second part, complementary approaches for many-particle systems are used to study the non-equilibrium scrambling dynamics in quantum-critical bosonic systems with large particle numbers, revealing an unscrambling mechanism due to criticality that is verified in extensive numerical simulations.}

We discuss the semi-classical model for this system (the Gross-Pitaevski (GP) equation) which is valid for a large number of atoms in the condensate and show that it is equivalent to an integrable classical dynamical system with multiple fixed points whose locations depend on the parameters of the system. We then discuss the full quantum mechanical model (the Bose--Hubbard Hamiltonian) both with and without dissipation. We demonstrate the surprising result that dissipation can actually enhance the condensate fraction and the EPR entanglement by driving the system nearer to the (classical) fixed points. We also show that the full quantum model predicts a tunneling phenomenon that is absent in the GP equation and that, in principle, should be observable in near-term experiments.",

	abstract = {We study information retrieval from evaporating black holes, assuming that the internal dynamics of a black hole is unitary and rapidly mixing, and assuming that the retriever has unlimited control over the emitted Hawking radiation. If the evaporation of the black hole has already proceeded past the ``half-way'' point, where half of the initial entropy has been radiated away, then additional quantum information deposited in the black hole is revealed in the Hawking radiation very rapidly. Information deposited prior to the half-way point remains concealed until the half-way point, and then emerges quickly. These conclusions hold because typical local quantum circuits are efficient encoders for quantum error-correcting codes that nearly achieve the capacity of the quantum erasure channel. Our estimate of a black hole's information retention time, based on speculative dynamical assumptions, is just barely compatible with the black hole complementarity hypothesis.}

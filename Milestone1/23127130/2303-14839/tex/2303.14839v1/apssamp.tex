\begin{abstract}
Fast scrambling of quantum correlations, reflected by the exponential growth of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators (OTOCs) on short pre-Ehrenfest time scales, is commonly considered as a major signature of quantum chaos in quantum systems with a classical limit. In two recent works, by Hummel et al.~\cite{Hummel2019} and by Scaffidi et al.~\cite{Scaffidi2020}, a significant difference in the  scrambling rate of integrable (many-body) systems was observed, depending on the initial state being semiclassically localized around unstable fixed points or fully delocalized (infinite temperature). Specifically, the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\lq$ quantifying the OTOC growth is given, respectively, by $\lq=2\ls$ or $\lambda_{\rm q}=\ls$ in terms of the stability exponent $\ls$ of the hyperbolic fixed point. Here we show that a wave packet, initially localized around this fixed point, features a distinct {\it dynamical} transition between these two regions. We present an analytical semiclassical approach providing a physical picture of this phenomenon and support our findings by extensive numerical simulations in the whole parameter range of locally unstable dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard dimer. Our results suggest that the existence of this transition is a hallmark of unstable separatrix dynamics in integrable systems. This allows one to distinguish, within the exponential OTOC growth behavior, unstable integrable (many-body) dynamics from genuine chaotic dynamics featuring uniform growth.

% A major signature of quantum chaos is the fast scrambling of quantum correlations, reflected by the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\lq$ that quantifies the short-(pre-Ehrenfest) time exponential growth of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators (OTOCs) in systems displaying unstable classical dynamics. In two recent works, by Hummel et al. and by Scaffidi et al., it was observed that around unstable fixed points of integrable systems there is a significant difference in the rate of scrambling depending on the nature of the initial state being quasiclassically localized or fully delocalized (infinite temperature). Specifically, the quantum Lyapunov exponent is given respectively by $\lq=2\ls$ or $\lambda_{\rm q}=\ls$ in terms of the stability exponent $\ls$ of the hyperbolic fixed point. We show here that a quasiclassical wave-packet localized around the fixed point displays in fact a clear {\it dynamical} transition between these two regions and, by extending previous quasiclassical analysis into the time domain, we present an analytical approach providing a physical picture of this phenomenon. Our findings, supported by extensive numerical simulations in all the range of parameters where a system of interacting bosons in two wells displays locally unstable dynamics, suggest that the existence of the transition is a hallmark of separatrix dynamics in integrable systems and therefore allows to use its absence in the OTOCs  as a signature of  genuine chaos.

    "abstract": "Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector, one of the advanced members of the Micro Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) group, is widely used in High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. The high rate handling capability and spatial resolution make it a desired tracking detector for high rate HEP experiments. Investigation of the long-term stability is an essential criterion for any tracking device used in HEP experiments. To investigate the long-term stability of a Single Mask~(SM) triple GEM detector prototype, it is irradiated continuously using a $^{55}$Fe X-ray source of energy 5.9 keV. The chamber is operated with Ar/CO$_2$ gas mixture in continuous flow mode. The gain and energy resolution of the chamber are calculated from the 5.9 keV X-ray peak and studied as a function of time. The applied voltage, divider current and also the environmental parameters (ambient temperature, pressure and relative humidity) are recorded continuously. It is observed that at a fixed applied voltage, the divider current of the detector is changing with time and as a result, the gain of the detector also changes. A systematic investigation is carried out to understand the probable reasons behind the observed variation in divider current and also to find its possible remedies. The details of the experimental setup, methodology and results are discussed in this article.",

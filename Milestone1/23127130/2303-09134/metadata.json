    "abstract": "We have shown previously that the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), can detect hundreds of Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) sources simultaneously across a field of view $\\sim30^\\circ$ in extent. To test if we can use this capability to track heliospheric structures, we undertook a search of 88 hours of MWA IPS data, and identified an observation likely to have a significant Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) in the field of view. We demonstrate that in a single 5-minute MWA observation we are able to localise and image a CME $\\sim$33 hours after launch at an elongation of $\\sim37^\\circ$ from the Sun. We use IPS observables to constrain the kinematics of the CME, and describe how MWA IPS observations can be used in the future to make a unique contribution to heliospheric modelling efforts.",

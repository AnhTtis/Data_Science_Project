    "abstract": "Atomic arrays provide an important quantum optical platform with photon-mediated dipoledipole interactions, which can be engineered to realize key applications in quantum information processing. A major obstacle for such application is the fast decay of the excited states. By controlling two-band Bloch oscillations in an atomic array under external magnetic field, here we show that exotic subradiance can be realized and maintained at a time scale upto 12 orders of magnitude larger than the spontaneous decay time in atomic arrays with the finite size. The key finding is to show a way for preventing the wavepacket of excited states scattering into the dissipative zone inside the free space light cone, which therefore leads to the excitation staying at a subradiant state for extremely long decay time. We show that such operation can be achieved by introducing a spatially linear potential from external magnetic field in atomic arrays and then manipulating interconnected two-band Bloch oscillations along opposite directions. Our results also point out the possibility of controllable switching between superradiant and subradiant states, which leads to potential applications in quantum storage.",

  abstract =     {A strong inhomogeneous static electric field is used to spatially disperse a
                  supersonic beam of polar molecules, according to their quantum state. We show that
                  the molecules residing in the lowest-lying rotational states can be selected and
                  used as targets for further experiments. As an illustration, we demonstrate an
                  unprecedented degree of laser-induced 1D alignment
                  $\left(\langle\cos^2\theta_{2D}\rangle=0.97\right)$ and strong orientation of
                  state-selected iodobenzene molecules. This method should enable experiments on
                  pure samples of polar molecules in their rotational ground state, offering new
                  opportunities in molecular science.},

A broad set of new applications await ultracold molecules, and the extension of laser cooling to molecules has begun. A molecular magneto-optical trap has been demonstrated, where molecules approached the Doppler limit. However, the sub-Doppler temperatures required for most applications have not yet been reached. Here we cool molecules to 50 uK, well below the Doppler limit, using a three-dimensional optical molasses. These ultracold molecules could be loaded into optical tweezers to trap arbitrary arrays for quantum simulation, launched into a molecular fountain for testing fundamental physics, and used to study ultracold collisions and ultracold chemistry.},

Ultracold chemical reactions are often controlled by preparing the reactants in specific quantum states. Here we demonstrate spin-controlled atom--ion inelastic (spin-exchange) processes and chemical (charge-exchange) reactions in an ultracold Rb-Sr+ mixture. The ion's spin state is controlled by the atomic hyperfine spin state via spin-exchange collisions, which polarize the ion's spin parallel to the atomic spin. We achieve {\~{}} 90{\%} spin polarization due to the absence of strong spin-relaxation channel. Charge-exchange collisions involving electron transfer are only allowed for (RbSr)+ colliding in the singlet manifold. Initializing the atoms in various spin states affects the overlap of the collision wave function with the singlet molecular manifold and therefore also the reaction rate. Our observations agree with theoretical predictions.},

For a hyperfine qubit stored in the long-lived 4S{\_}1/2 (F=3, F=4) sub-levels of 43Ca+ we propose and implement a simple and robust optical pumping scheme to transfer the hyperfine qubit to the optical qubit, capable of a theoretical fidelity 99.95{\%} in 10us.

  abstract      = {Quantum computers are able to outperform classical algorithms. This was long recognized by the visionary Richard Feynman who pointed out in the 1980s that quantum mechanical problems were better solved with quantum machines. It was only in 1994 that Peter Shor came up with an algorithm that is able to calculate the prime factors of a large number vastly more efficiently than known possible with a classical computer. This paradigmatic algorithm stimulated the flourishing research in quantum information processing and the quest for an actual implementation of a quantum computer. Over the last fifteen years, using skillful optimizations, several instances of a Shor algorithm have been implemented on various platforms and clearly proved the feasibility of quantum factoring. For general scalability, though, a different approach has to be pursued. Here, we report the realization of a fully scalable Shor algorithm as proposed by Kitaev. For this, we demonstrate factoring the number fifteen by effectively employing and controlling seven qubits and four "cache-qubits", together with the implementation of generalized arithmetic operations, known as modular multipliers. The scalable algorithm has been realized with an ion-trap quantum computer exhibiting success probabilities in excess of 90{\%}.},

One is a publicly accessible superconducting transmon device (www. RESEARCH ibm.com/ibm-q) with limited connectivity, and the other is a fully connected trapped-ion system. Even though the two systems have different native quantum interactions, both can be programed in a way that is blind to the underlying hardware, thus allowing a comparison of identical quantum algorithms between different physical systems. We show that quantum algorithms and circuits that use more connectivity clearly benefit from a better-connected system of qubits. Although the quantum systems here are not yet large enough to eclipse classical computers, this experiment exposes critical factors of scaling quantum computers, such as qubit connectivity and gate expressivity. In addition, the results suggest that codesigning particular quantum applications with the hardware itself will be paramount in successfully using quantum computers in the future.},

This model is a generalization of our model for fine- and hyperfine- structure effects in one-photon ionization of molecules presented in the preceding companion article. This generalization is achieved by covering two main aspects: (1) treatment of the neutral bound-bound transition including hyperfine structure that makes up the first step of the REMPI process and (2) modification of our ionization model to account for anisotropic populations resulting from this first excitation step. Our findings may be used for analyzing results from experiments with molecular ions produced by REMPI and may serve as a theoretical background for hyperfine-selective ionization experiments.},

  abstract      = {Progress in atomic, optical and quantum science has led to rapid improvements in atomic clocks. At the same time, atomic clock research has helped to advance the frontiers of science, affecting both fundamental and applied research. The ability to control quantum states of individual atoms and photons is central to quantum information science and precision measurement, and optical clocks based on single ions have achieved the lowest systematic uncertainty of any frequency standard. Although many-atom lattice clocks have shown advantages in measurement precision over trapped-ion clocks, their accuracy has remained 16 times worse. Here we demonstrate a many-atom system that achieves an accuracy of 6.4 × 10(-18), which is not only better than a single-ion-based clock, but also reduces the required measurement time by two orders of magnitude. By systematically evaluating all known sources of uncertainty, including in situ monitoring of the blackbody radiation environment, we improve the accuracy of optical lattice clocks by a factor of 22. This single clock has simultaneously achieved the best known performance in the key characteristics necessary for consideration as a primary standard-stability and accuracy. More stable and accurate atomic clocks will benefit a wide range of fields, such as the realization and distribution of SI units, the search for time variation of fundamental constants, clock-based geodesy and other precision tests of the fundamental laws of nature. This work also connects to the development of quantum sensors and many-body quantum state engineering (such as spin squeezing) to advance measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit.},

  abstract      = {High-precision measurements with molecules may refine our knowledge of various fields of physics, from atmospheric and interstellar physics to the standard model or physics beyond it. Most of them can be cast as absorption frequency measurements, particularly in the mid-infrared `molecular fingerprint' region, creating the need for narrow-linewidth lasers of well-controlled frequency. Quantum cascade lasers provide a wide spectral coverage anywhere in the mid-infrared, but show substantial free-running frequency fluctuations. Here, we demonstrate that the excellent stability and accuracy of an ultra-stable near-infrared laser, transferred from a metrological institute through a fibre link, can be copied to a quantum cascade laser using an optical frequency comb. The obtained relative stability and accuracy of 2 × 10−15 and 10−14 exceed those demonstrated so far with quantum cascade lasers by almost two orders of magnitude. This set-up enables us to measure molecular absorption frequencies with state-of-the-art uncertainties, confirming its potential for ultra-high-precision spectroscopy.},

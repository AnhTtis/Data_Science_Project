\section{Pathologist assessment}
\label{Sec:pathologist_assessment}

To understand how well human experts can distinguish between artificial and real images of stained tissue, we performed an assessment by pathologists. We asked two pathologists (P1 with 6 years of experience, P2 with 17 years of experience) to identify the 200 artificial images in a mixture of 200 real and 200 artificial images generated by CycleGAN and MUNIT. The images were sampled from the validation set. As shown in \tableref{Tab:path_test}, it was challenging for both pathologists to identify the artificial images.
The results for CycleGAN were close to random guessing, whereas for MUNIT it was possible to identify the artificial images in some cases.

%CycleGAN performed better compared to Munit, with results that were close to random guess (0.5).

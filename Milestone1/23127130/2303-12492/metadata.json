    "abstract": "In the last years, robots are moving out of research laboratories to enter everyday life. Competitions aiming at benchmarking the capabilities of a robot in everyday scenarios are useful to make a step forward in this path. In fact, they foster the development of robust architectures capable of solving issues that might occur during human-robot coexistence in human-shaped scenarios. One of those competitions is SciRoc that, in its second edition, proposed new benchmarking environments. In particular, Episode 1 of SciRoc 2 proposed three different modalities of participation while preserving the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), being a fundamental benchmarking functionality. The Coffee Shop environment, used to challenge the participating teams, represented an excellent testbed enabling for the benchmarking of different robotics functionalities, but also an exceptional opportunity for proposing novel solutions to guarantee real human-robot interaction procedures despite the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. The developed software is publicly released.",

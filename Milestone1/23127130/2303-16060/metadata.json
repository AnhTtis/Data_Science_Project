    "abstract": "The young planetary nebula NGC 6302 is known to exhibit Raman-scattered He II features at 6545 and 4851 Angstrom. These features are formed through inelastic scattering of He II$λλ$ 1025 and 972 with hydrogen atoms in the ground state, for which the cross sections are $1.2 \\times 10^{-21}$ and $1.4\\times 10^{-22} {\\rm\\ cm^2}$, respectively. We investigate the spectrum of NGC 6302 archived in the ESO Science Portal. Our Gaussian line fitting analysis shows that the Raman-scattered He II features are broader and more redshifted than the hypothetical model Raman features that would be formed in a cold static H I medium. We adopt a simple scattering geometry consisting of a compact He II emission region surrounded by a H I medium to perform Monte Carlo simulations using the radiative transfer code ${\\it STaRS}$. Our simulations show that the H I region is characterized by the H I column density $N_{\\rm HI}=3\\times 10^{21}{\\rm\\ cm^{-2}}$ with the random speed component $v_{\\rm ran}=10{\\rm\\ km\\ s^{-1}}$ expanding with a speed $v_{\\rm exp}= 13{\\rm\\ km\\ s^{-1}}$ from the He II emission region. Based on our best fit parameters, we estimate the H I mass of the neutral medium $M_{\\rm HI} \\simeq 1.0\\times 10^{-2}\\ {\\rm M_\\odot}$, pointing out the usefulness of Raman He II spectroscopy as a tool to trace H I components.",

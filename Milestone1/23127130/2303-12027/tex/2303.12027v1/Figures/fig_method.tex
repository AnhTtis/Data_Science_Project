Overview of our joint visual grounding and tracking framework. Given a sequence and a natural language description, we first feed the description, the first frame (test image), and zero padding tokens into the model for visual grounding and accordingly obtain the template image. For each subsequent frame (test image), we feed it with the description and template image into the model for tracking.
$\odot$ and $\oplus$ denote the element-wise product and summation operations, respectively.}

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented \net for online continual learning of visual-inertial odometry. \net exploits an unsupervised training scheme during inference time and thus seamlessly adapts to new domains. In particular, we explicitly address the shortcomings of previous works by designing a lightweight network architecture and by proposing a novel fixed-size replay buffer that maximizes image diversity. Using experience replay, \net successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient online domain adaptation. We further provide an asynchronous version of \net separating the core motion estimation from the network update step, hence allowing true continuous inference in real time. In extensive evaluations, we demonstrated that \net outperforms competitive baselines. We also made the code and models publicly available to facilitate future research. Future work will focus on extending this work to a multi-task setup for robotic vision systems.

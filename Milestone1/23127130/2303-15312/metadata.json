    "abstract": "To optimize the performance of the Collinear Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy (CRIS) experiment at CERN-ISOLDE, technical upgrades are continuously introduced, aiming to enhance its sensitivity, precision, stability, and efficiency. Recently, a voltage-scanning setup was developed and commissioned at CRIS, which improved the scanning speed by a factor of three as compared to the current laser-frequency scanning approach. This leads to faster measurements of the hyperfine structure for systems with high yields (more than a few thousand ions per second). Additionally, several beamline sections have been redesigned and manufactured, including a new field-ionization unit, a sharper electrostatic bend, and improved ion optics. The beamline upgrades are expected to yield an improvement of at least a factor of 5 in the signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing the non-resonant laser ions and providing time-of-flight separation between the resonant ions and the collisional background. Overall, the presented developments will further improve the selectivity, sensitivity, and efficiency of the CRIS technique.",

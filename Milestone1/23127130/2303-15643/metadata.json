    "abstract": "This study investigates a new hybrid method for solving the combinatorial problem of optimizing fractional functions with 0-1 binary variables. The method combines density matrix minimization (DMM), tabu search (TS), and the Dinkelbach algorithm to optimize fractional functions. Although DMM alone did not provide a sufficiently accurate solution, combining DMM with TS significantly improved the accuracy.",

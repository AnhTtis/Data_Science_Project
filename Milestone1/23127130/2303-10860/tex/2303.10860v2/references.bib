abstract = {We consider the problem of approximating arbitrary single-qubit z-rotations by ancilla-free Clifford+T circuits, up to given epsilon. We present a fast new probabilistic algorithm for solving this problem optimally, i.e., for finding the shortest possible circuit whatsoever for the given problem instance. The algorithm requires a factoring oracle (such as a quantum computer). Even in the absence of a factoring oracle, the algorithm is still near-optimal under a mild number-theoretic hypothesis. In this case, the algorithm finds a solution of T-count m + O(log(log(1/ε))), where m is the T-count of the second-to-optimal solution. In the typical case, this yields circuit approximations of T- count 3 log2(1/ε)+O(log(log(1/ε))). Our algorithm is efficient in practice, and provably efficient under the above-mentioned number-theoretic hypothesis, in the sense that its expected runtime is O(polylog(1/ε)).},

abstract = {We consider the problem of ambiguous discrimination of two quantum states when we are only allowed to perform a restricted set of measurements. Let the bias of a POVM be defined as the total variational distance between the outcome distributions for the two states to be distinguished. The performance of a set of measurements can then be defined as the ratio of the bias of this POVM and the largest bias achievable by any measurements. We first provide lower bounds on the performance of various POVMs acting on a single system such as the isotropic POVM, and spherical 2 and 4-designs, and show how these bounds can lead to certainty relations. Furthermore, we prove lower bounds for several interesting POVMs acting on multipartite systems, such as the set of local POVMS, POVMs which can be implemented using local operations and classical communication (LOCC), separable POVMs, and finally POVMs for which every bipartition results in a measurement having positive partial transpose (PPT). In particular, our results show that a scheme of Terhal et. al. for hiding data against local operations and classical communication [31] has the best possible dimensional dependence.},

abstract = {Quantum computation offers a promising new kind of information processing, where the non-classical features of quantum mechanics are harnessed and exploited. A number of models of quantum computation exist. These models have been shown to be formally equivalent, but their underlying elementary concepts and the requirements for their practical realization can differ significantly. A particularly exciting paradigm is that of measurement-based quantum computation, where the processing of quantum information takes place by rounds of simple measurements on qubits prepared in a highly entangled state. We review recent developments in measurement-based quantum computation with a view to both fundamental and practical issues, in particular the power of quantum computation, the protection against noise (fault tolerance) and steps towards experimental realization. Finally, we highlight a number of connections between this field and other branches of physics and mathematics.},

This divides the state space into various sets, including states which are free (because they can be created under the class of operations), and those which are a resource (because they cannot be). One can quantify the worth of the resource by the relative entropy distance to the set of free states, and under certain conditions, this is a unique measure which quantifies the rate of state to state transitions. The framework includes entanglement, asymmetry and purity theory. It also includes thermodynamics, which is a hybrid resource theory combining purity theory and asymmetry. Another hybrid resource theory which merges purity theory and entanglement can be used to study quantumness of correlations and discord, and we present quantumness in this more general framework of resource theories. }

Quite limited progress has been made for this approach even in simple systems due to the various potential complexities. Here we analytically solve the optimal scheme to find out the closest distance between the objective qubit state and all the possible states convexly mixed by some limited states, namely, to optimally construct the objective qubit state using the quantum states within any given state set. In particular, we find the least number of (not more than four) states within a given set to optimally construct the objective state and also find that any state can be optimally established by at most four quantum states of the set. The examples in various cases are presented to verify our analytic solutions further.}

    abstract = { This paper shows that quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant against errors and inaccuracies when \$\eta\$, the probability for an error in a qubit or a gate, is smaller than a constant threshold \$\eta\_c\$. This result improves on Shor's result [Proceedings of the 37th Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, 1996, pp. 56\UTF{2013}65], which shows how to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation when the error rate \$\eta\$ decays polylogarithmically with the size of the computation, an assumption which is physically unreasonable. The cost of making the quantum circuit fault-tolerant in our construction is polylogarithmic in time and space. Our result holds for a very general local noise model, which includes probabilistic errors, decoherence, amplitude damping, depolarization, and systematic inaccuracies in the gates. Moreover, we allow exponentially decaying correlations between the errors both in space and in time. Fault-tolerant computation can be performed with any universal set of gates. The result also holds for quantum particles with \$p>2\$ states, namely, p-qudits, and is also generalized to one-dimensional quantum computers with only nearest-neighbor interactions. No measurements, or classical operations, are required during the quantum computation. We estimate the threshold of our construction to be \$\eta\_c\simeq 10^{-6}\$, in the best case. By this we show that local noise is in principle not an obstacle for scalable quantum computation. The main ingredient of our proof is the computation on states encoded by a quantum error correcting code (QECC). To this end we introduce a special class of Calderbank\UTF{2013}Shor\UTF{2013}Steane (CSS) codes, called polynomial codes (the quantum analogue of Reed\UTF{2013}Solomon codes). Their nice algebraic structure allows all of the encoded gates to be transversal. We also provide another version of the proof which uses more general CSS codes, but its encoded gates are slightly less elegant. To achieve fault tolerance, we encode the quantum circuit by another circuit by using one of these QECCs. This step is repeated polyloglog many times, each step slightly improving the effective error rate, to achieve the desired reliability. The resulting circuit exhibits a hierarchical structure, and for the analysis of its robustness we borrow terminology from Khalfin and Tsirelson [Found. Phys., 22 (1992), pp. 879\UTF{2013}948] and G\UTF{00E1}cs [Advances in Computing Research: A Research Annual: Randomness and Computation, JAI Press, Greenwich, CT, 1989]. The paper is to a large extent self-contained. In particular, we provide simpler proofs for many of the known results we use, such as the fact that it suffices to correct for bit-flips and phase-flips, the correctness of CSS codes, and the fact that two-qubit gates are universal, together with their extensions to higher-dimensional particles. We also provide full proofs of the universality of the sets of gates we use (the proof of universality was missing in Shor's paper). This paper thus provides a self-contained and complete proof of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation in the presence of local noise. }

Suppose, however, that the gates that act on these logical qubits are only approximation of the desired gate. This can arise, for example, in synthesizing a single qubit unitary from a set of Clifford and T gates; for a generic such unitary, any finite sequence of gates only approximates the desired target. In this case, errors in the gate can add coherently so that, roughly, the error ε in the unitary of each gate must scale as ε \UTF{2264} 1/N, where N is the number of gates. If, however, one has the option of synthesizing one of several unitaries near the desired target, and if an average of these options is closer to the target, we give some elementary bounds showing cases in which the errors can be made to add incoherently by averaging over random choices, so that, roughly, one needs ε \UTF{2264} 1/√N.

abstract = {If a photon of definite polarization encounters an excited atom, there is typically some nonvanishing probability that the atom will emit a second photon by stimulated emission. Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.},

abstract = {Does the quantum state represent reality or our knowledge of reality? In making this distinction precise, we are led to a novel classification of hidden variable models of quantum theory. We show that representatives of each class can be found among existing constructions for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our approach also provides a fruitful new perspective on arguments for the nonlocality and incompleteness of quantum theory. Specifically, we show that for models wherein the quantum state has the status of something real, the failure of locality can be established through an argument considerably more straightforward than Bell's theorem. The historical significance of this result becomes evident when one recognizes that the same reasoning is present in Einstein's preferred argument for incompleteness, which dates back to 1935. This fact suggests that Einstein was seeking not just any completion of quantum theory, but one wherein quantum states are solely representative of our knowledge. Our hypothesis is supported by an analysis of Einstein's attempts to clarify his views on quantum theory and the circumstance of his otherwise puzzling abandonment of an even simpler argument for incompleteness from 1927.},

One possibility is that a pure quantum state corresponds directly to reality.

Here we show that any model in which a quantum state represents mere information about an underlying physical state of the system, and in which systems that are prepared independently have independent physical states, must make predictions that contradict those of quantum theory.},

	journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
	abstract = {In the context of a physical theory, two devices, A and B, described by the theory are called incompatible if the theory does not allow the existence of a third device C that would have both A and B as its components. Incompatibility is a fascinating aspect of physical theories, especially in the case of quantum theory. The concept of incompatibility gives a common ground for several famous impossibility statements within quantum theory, such as ‘no-cloning’ and ‘no information without disturbance’; these can be all seen as statements about incompatibility of certain devices. The purpose of this paper is to give a concise overview of some of the central aspects of incompatibility.}

@article{DR18,
abstract = {Quantum theory provides an extremely accurate description of fundamental processes in physics. It thus seems likely that the theory is applicable beyond the, mostly microscopic, domain in which it has been tested experimentally. Here, we propose a Gedankenexperiment to investigate the question whether quantum theory can, in principle, have universal validity. The idea is that, if the answer was yes, it must be possible to employ quantum theory to model complex systems that include agents who are themselves using quantum theory. Analysing the experiment under this presumption, we find that one agent, upon observing a particular measurement outcome, must conclude that another agent has predicted the opposite outcome with certainty. The agents' conclusions, although all derived within quantum theory, are thus inconsistent. This indicates that quantum theory cannot be extrapolated to complex systems, at least not in a straightforward manner.},

abstract = {Predicting the properties of complex, large-scale quantum systems is essential for developing quantum technologies. We present an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements of the state. This description, called a ‘classical shadow', can be used to predict many different properties; order $${\mathrm{log}}\,(M)$$measurements suffice to accurately predict M different functions of the state with high success probability. The number of measurements is independent of the system size and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians. The numerical results highlight the advantages of classical shadows relative to previously known methods.},

abstract = "Generalizing a decision problem for bipartite perfect matching, Edmonds (J. Res. Natl. Bur. Standards 718(4) (1967) 242) introduced the problem (now known as the Edmonds Problem) of deciding if a given linear subspace of M(N) contains a non-singular matrix, where M(N) stands for the linear space of complex N×N matrices. This problem led to many fundamental developments in matroid theory, etc. Classical matching theory can be defined in terms of matrices with non-negative entries. The notion of Positive operator, central in Quantum Theory, is a natural generalization of matrices with non-negative entries. (Here operator refers to maps from matrices to matrices.) First, we reformulate the Edmonds Problem in terms of completely positive operators, or equivalently, in terms of bipartite density matrices. It turns out that one of the most important cases when Edmonds' problem can be solved in polynomial deterministic time, i.e. an intersection of two geometric matroids, corresponds to unentangled (aka separable) bipartite density matrices. We introduce a very general class (or promise) of linear subspaces of M(N) on which there exists a polynomial deterministic time algorithm to solve Edmonds' problem. The algorithm is a thoroughgoing generalization of algorithms in Linial, Samorodnitsky and Wigderson, Proceedings of the 30th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, New York, 1998; Gurvits and Yianilos, and its analysis benefits from an operator analog of permanents, so-called Quantum Permanents. Finally, we prove that the weak membership problem for the convex set of separable normalized bipartite density matrices is NP-HARD."

abstract = {Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are a framework for exact or approximate optimization with widespread application in quantum information theory. We introduce a new method for using reductions to construct integrality gaps for SDPs, meaning instances where the SDP value is far from the true optimum. These are based on new limitations on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy in approximating two particularly important sets in quantum information theory, where previously no $\omega$(1) -round integrality gaps were known: 1.The set of separable (i.e. unentangled) states, or equivalently, the 2 → 4 norm of a matrix.2.The set of quantum correlations; i.e. conditional probability distributions achievable with local measurements on a shared entangled state.Integrality gaps for the 2 → 4 norm had previously been sought due to its connection to Small-Set Expansion (SSE) and Unique Games (UG). In both cases no-go theorems were previously known based on computational assumptions such as the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) which asserts that 3-SAT requires exponential time to solve. Our unconditional results achieve the same parameters as all of these previous results (for separable states) or as some of the previous results (for quantum correlations). In some cases we can make use of the framework of Lee\UTF{2013}Raghavendra\UTF{2013}Steurer (LRS) to establish integrality gaps for any SDP extended formulation, not only the SoS hierarchy. Our hardness result on separable states also yields a dimension lower bound of approximate disentanglers, answering a question of Watrous and Aaronson et\UTF{00A0}al. These results can be viewed as limitations on the monogamy principle, the PPT test, the ability of Tsirelson-type bounds to restrict quantum correlations, as well as the SDP hierarchies of Doherty\UTF{2013}Parrilo\UTF{2013}Spedalieri, Navascues\UTF{2013}Pironio\UTF{2013}Acin, and Berta\UTF{2013}Fawzi\UTF{2013}Scholz. Indeed a wide range of past work in quantum information can be described as using an SDP on one of the above two problems and our results put broad limits on these lines of argument.},

abstract = {Composite systems consisting of a large number of similar subsystems play an important role in many areas of physics as well as in information theory. Their analysis, however, often relies on the assumption that the subsystems are mutually independent (or only weakly correlated). Here, we show that this assumption is generally justified for quantum systems that are symmetric, that is, invariant under permutations of the subsystems. Because symmetry is often implied by natural properties, for example, the indistinguishability of identical particles, the result has a wide range of consequences. In particular, it implies that global properties of a large composite system can be estimated by measurements applied to a limited number of (randomly chosen) sample subsystems, a fact that is important for the interpretation of experimental data. Moreover, it generalizes statements in quantum information theory and cryptography, which previously have only been known to hold under certain independence assumptions.},

In this paper, we show that an upper bound on the trace distance of this approximation is given by {\$}{\$}{\{}2$\backslash$frac{\{}kd{\^{}}2{\}}{\{}n{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}, where d is the dimension of the individual system, thereby improving previously known bounds. Our result follows from a more general approximation theorem for representations of the unitary group. Consider a pure state that lies in the irreducible representation {\$}{\$}{\{}U{\_}{\{}$\backslash$mu +$\backslash$nu{\}} $\backslash$subset U{\_}$\backslash$mu $\backslash$otimes U{\_}$\backslash$nu{\}}{\$}{\$}of the unitary group U(d), for highest weights\UTF{00A0}$\mu$, $\nu$ and\UTF{00A0}$\mu$\UTF{00A0}+\UTF{00A0}$\nu$. Let $\xi$$\mu$ be the state obtained by tracing out U$\nu$. Then $\xi$$\mu$ is close to a convex combination of the coherent states {\$}{\$}{\{}U{\_}$\backslash$mu(g)|{\{}v{\_}$\backslash$mu$\backslash$rangle{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}, where {\$}{\$}{\{}g$\backslash$in U(d){\}}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{\{}|v{\_}$\backslash$mu$\backslash$rangle{\}}{\$}{\$}is the highest weight vector in U$\mu$.},

abstract = {We give a test that can distinguish efficiently between product states of n quantum systems and states that are far from product. If applied to a state |ψ〉 whose maximum overlap with a product state is 1 − ε, the test passes with probability 1 − Θ(ε), regardless of n or the local dimensions of the individual systems. The test uses two copies of |ψ〉. We prove correctness of this test as a special case of a more general result regarding stability of maximum output purity of the depolarizing channel.A key application of the test is to quantum Merlin-Arthur games with multiple Merlins, where we obtain several structural results that had been previously conjectured, including the fact that efficient soundness amplification is possible and that two Merlins can simulate many Merlins: QMA(k) = QMA(2) for k \UTF{2265} 2. Building on a previous result of Aaronson et al., this implies that there is an efficient quantum algorithm to verify 3-SAT with constant soundness, given two unentangled proofs of \~{O}(√n) qubits. We also show how QMA(2) with log-sized proofs is equivalent to a large number of problems, some related to quantum information (such as testing separability of mixed states) as well as problems without any apparent connection to quantum mechanics (such as computing injective tensor norms of 3-index tensors). As a consequence, we obtain many hardness-of-approximation results, as well as potential algorithmic applications of methods for approximating QMA(2) acceptance probabilities.Finally, our test can also be used to construct an efficient test for determining whether a unitary operator is a tensor product, which is a generalization of classical linearity testing.},

abstract="This paper presents a series of results on the interplay between quantum estimation, cloning and finite de Finetti theorems. First, we consider the measure-and-prepare channel that uses optimal estimation to convert M copies into k approximate copies of an unknown pure state and we show that this channel is equal to a random loss of all but s particles followed by cloning from s to k copies. When the number k of output copies is large with respect to the number M of input copies the measure-and-prepare channel converges in diamond norm to the optimal universal cloning. In the opposite case, when M is large compared to k, the estimation becomes almost perfect and the measure-and-prepare channel converges in diamond norm to the partial trace over all but k systems. This result is then used to derive de Finetti-type results for quantum states and for symmetric broadcast channels, that is, channels that distribute quantum information to many receivers in a permutationally invariant fashion. Applications of the finite de Finetti theorem for symmetric broadcast channels include the derivation of diamond-norm bounds on the asymptotic convergence of quantum cloning to state estimation and the derivation of bounds on the amount of quantum information that can be jointly decoded by a group of k receivers at the output of a symmetric broadcast channel.",

@article{HLW06,
abstract = {We study entanglement and other correlation properties of random states in high-dimensional bipartite systems. These correlations are quantified by parameters that are subject to the "concentration of measure" phenomenon, meaning that on a large-probability set these parameters are close to their expectation. For the entropy of entanglement, this has the counterintuitive consequence that there exist large subspaces in which all pure states are close to maximally entangled. This, in turn, implies the existence of mixed states with entanglement of formation near that of a maximally entangled state, but with negligible quantum mutual information and, therefore, negligible distillable entanglement, secret key, and common randomness. It also implies a very strong locking effect for the entanglement of formation: its value can jump from maximal to near zero by tracing over a number of qubits negligible compared to the size of the total system. Furthermore, such properties are generic. Similar phenomena are observed for random multiparty states, leading us to speculate on the possibility that the theory of entanglement is much simplified when restricted to asymptotically generic states. Further consequences of our results include a complete derandomization of the protocol for universal superdense coding of quantum states.},

    "abstract": "Let $S$ be the 2-sphere and $V \\subset S$ be a finite set of at least three points. We show that for each function $κ: V \\rightarrow (0, 2π)$ satisfying elementary necessary conditions, in each discrete conformal class of spherical cone-metrics there exists a unique metric realizing $κ$ as its discrete curvature. This can be seen as a discrete version of a result of Luo and Tian.",

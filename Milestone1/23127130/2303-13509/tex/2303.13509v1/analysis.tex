\subsection{Visual Analysis}\label{sec:Analysis}


Fig~\ref{fig:attn_update}-(a) illustrates the update process of query positional attention with and without PA-Seg. Queries initially learn positional priors from the dataset and pay attention to a ring-shaped region. During the update, queries without PA-Seg are not aware of updating their positional attention. However, with PA-Seg, queries quickly converge their positional attention and specialize in a small region. Fig.~\ref{fig:attn_update}-(b) further demonstrates the impact of PA-Seg on mask predictions. The specialization of positional focal attention enabled by PA-Seg aids in successfully separating a car from a crowded scene.

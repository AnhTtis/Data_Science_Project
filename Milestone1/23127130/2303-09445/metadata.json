    "abstract": "Given a dynamical system with polynomial right-hand side, can it be generated by a reaction network that possesses certain properties? This question is important because some network properties may guarantee specific dynamical properties, such as existence or uniqueness of equilibria, persistence, permanence, or global stability. Here we focus on this problem in the context of weakly reversible deficiency one networks. In particular, we describe an algorithm for deciding if a polynomial dynamical system admits a weakly reversible deficiency one realization, and identifying one if it does exist. In addition, we show that weakly reversible deficiency one realizations can be partitioned into mutually exclusive Type I and Type II realizations, where Type I realizations guarantee existence and uniqueness of positive steady states, while Type II realizations are related to stoichiometric generators, and therefore to multistability.",

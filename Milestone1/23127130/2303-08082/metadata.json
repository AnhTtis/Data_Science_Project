    "abstract": "We establish the existence of several quantum trace maps. The simplest one is an algebra map between two quantizations of the algebra of regular functions on the $SL_n$-character variety of a surface $\\mathfrak{S}$ equipped with an ideal triangulation $λ$. The first is the (stated) $SL_n$-skein algebra $\\mathscr{S}(\\mathfrak{S})$. The second $\\overline{\\mathcal{X}}(\\mathfrak{S},λ)$ is the Fock and Goncharov's quantization of their $X$-moduli space. The quantum trace is an algebra homomorphism $\\bar{tr}^X:\\overline{\\mathscr{S}}(\\mathfrak{S})\\to\\overline{\\mathcal{X}}(\\mathfrak{S},λ)$ where the reduced skein algebra $\\overline{\\mathscr{S}}(\\mathfrak{S})$ is a quotient of $\\mathscr{S}(\\mathfrak{S})$. When the quantum parameter is 1, the quantum trace $\\bar{tr}^X$ coincides with the classical Fock-Goncharov homomorphism. This is a generalization of the Bonahon-Wong quantum trace map for the case $n=2$. We then define the extended Fock-Goncharov algebra $\\mathcal{X}(\\mathfrak{S},λ)$ and show that $\\bar{tr}^X$ can be lifted to $tr^X:\\mathscr{S}(\\mathfrak{S})\\to\\mathcal{X}(\\mathfrak{S},λ)$. We show that both $\\bar{tr}^X$ and $tr^X$ are natural with respect to the change of triangulations. When each connected component of $\\mathfrak{S}$ has non-empty boundary and no interior ideal point, we define a quantization of the Fock-Goncharov $A$-moduli space $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}(\\mathfrak{S},λ)$ and its extension $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{S},λ)$. We then show that there exist quantum traces $\\bar{tr}^A:\\overline{\\mathscr{S}}(\\mathfrak{S})\\to\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}(\\mathfrak{S},λ)$ and $tr^A:\\mathscr{S}(\\mathfrak{S})\\hookrightarrow\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{S},λ)$, where the second map is injective, while the first is injective at least when $\\mathfrak{S}$ is a polygon. They are equivalent to the $X$-versions but have better algebraic properties.",

        Visualization of image-text cosine similarity-based methods for the \momentretrievaltask{} task.
        The 8-frame method (\textcolor{red}{red} with dashes and dots) achieves IoU=0.42 while the 0.10 threshold method (\textcolor{blue}{blue} with dashes) achieves IoU=0.19.
        Ground Truth bounds are indicated with the solid \textcolor{green}{green} lines.
        EVA-CLIP model was used for the plot.

    "abstract": "In this paper, using the Finslerian settings, we study the existence of parallel one forms (or, equivalently parallel vector fields) on a Riemannian manifold. We show that a parallel one form on a Riemannian manifold M is a holonomy invariant function on the tangent bundle T M with respect to the geodesic spray. We prove that if the metrizability freedom of the geodesic spray of (M, F) is 1, then the (M, F) does not admit a parallel one form. We investigate a sufficient condition on a Riemannian manifold to admit a parallel one form. As a by-product, we relate the existence of a proper affine Killing vector field by the metrizability freedom. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of a parallel one form on a Finsler manifold. By counter-examples, we show that if the metrizability freedom is greater than 1, then the manifold (Riemannian or Finslerian) does not necessarily admit a parallel one form. Various special cases and examples are studied and discussed.",

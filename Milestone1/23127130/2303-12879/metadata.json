    "abstract": "We show through non-equilibrium non-adiabatic electron-spin-lattice simulations that above a critical current in magnetic atomic wires with a narrow domain wall the electron flow triggers violent stimulated emission of phonons and magnons with an almost complete conversion of the incident electron momentum flux into a phonon and magnon flux. The electronic current suffers a heavy suppression above this threshold. This poses a fundamental limit to the current densities attainable in atomic wires. At the same time it opens up an exciting way of generating the alternative quasi-particle currents above once the requisite electronic-structure properties are met.",

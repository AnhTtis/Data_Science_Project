@article{cite-key,
	abstract = {Neutrinos were assumed to be massless particles until the discovery of the neutrino oscillation process. This phenomenon indicates that the neutrinos have non-zero masses and the mass eigenstates (ν1, ν2, ν3) are mixtures of their flavour eigenstates (νe, νμ, ντ). The oscillations between different flavour eigenstates are described by three mixing angles (θ12, θ23, θ13), two differences of the squared neutrino masses of the ν2/ν1 and ν3/ν1 pairs and a charge conjugation parity symmetry violating phase δCP. The Double Chooz experiment, located near the Chooz Electricit{\'e}de France reactors, measures the oscillation parameter θ13 using reactor neutrinos. Here, the Double Chooz collaboration reports the measurement of the mixing angle θ13 with the new total neutron capture detection technique from the full data set, yielding sin2(2θ13) = 0.105 $\pm$0.014. This measurement exploits the multidetector configuration, the isoflux baseline and data recorded when the reactors were switched off. In addition to the neutrino mixing angle measurement, Double Chooz provides a precise measurement of the reactor neutrino flux, given by the mean cross-section per fission 〈σf〉= (5.71 $\pm$0.06) ×10−43 cm2 per fission, and reports an empirical model of the distortion in the reactor neutrino spectrum.},

The calculations are done in the local density approximation and various nuclear effects like Pauli blocking, Fermi motion of nucleons and strong renormalization effects in the spin-isospin channel are taken into account. The nuclear effects are found to be quite large at low q2, but the data in this region are too meagre to influence the determination of MA. The experimental data on differential and total cross sections are found to be consistent with MA as determined from deuterium experiments and no conclusive evidence for quenching of MA in nuclei is found. On the other hand, the latest neutrino experiment by SKAT collaboration is found to be inconsistent with our theoretical results as well as with other neutrino experiments.},

	abstract = {We have performed a many-body calculation of the inclusive (e, e′) cross section which runs over the three traditional regions at intermediate energies: the quasielastic peak, the dip region and the delta region. The longitudinal and transverse response functions in the quasielastic peak have also been evaluated. Traditional effects like polarization, meson exchange currents, final state interaction and delta renormalization in the nuclear medium have been included. Meson exchange currents are generated from a model of pion electroproduction on the nucleon which reproduces accurately the experimental data. The inclusive cross section accounts for 1N, 2N, 3N mechanisms of virtual photon absorption and one pion production. Meson exchange currents associated to the (γ∗, 2π) reaction are also accounted for. We obtain good results for the (e, e′) cross sections in the whole energy range and for different nuclei. The response functions are also in good agreement with the latest experimental analysis. On the other hand, the method provides the separation of the contribution to the inclusive cross section from different physical channels which is a necessary input to evaluate cross sections like (e, e′ N), (e, e′ NN), (e, e′ π), etc.},

@article{t2knaturepaper,
	abstract = {The charge-conjugation and parity-reversal (CP) symmetry of fundamental particles is a symmetry between matter and antimatter. Violation of this CP symmetry was first observed in 19641, and CP violation in the weak interactions of quarks was soon established2. Sakharov proposed3 that CP violation is necessary to explain the observed imbalance of matter and antimatter abundance in the Universe. However, CP violation in quarks is too small to support this explanation. So far, CP violation has not been observed in non-quark elementary particle systems. It has been shown that CP violation in leptons could generate the matter--antimatter disparity through a process called leptogenesis4. Leptonic mixing, which appears in the standard model's charged current interactions5,6, provides a potential source of CP violation through a complex phase δCP, which is required by some theoretical models of leptogenesis7--9. This CP violation can be measured in muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations and the corresponding antineutrino oscillations, which are experimentally accessible using accelerator-produced beams as established by the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) and NOvA experiments10,11. Until now, the value of δCP has not been substantially constrained by neutrino oscillation experiments. Here we report a measurement using long-baseline neutrino and antineutrino oscillations observed by the T2K experiment that shows a large increase in the neutrino oscillation probability, excluding values of δCP that result in a large increase in the observed antineutrino oscillation probability at three standard deviations (3σ). The 3σconfidence interval for δCP, which is cyclic and repeats every 2π, is {$[$}−3.41, −0.03{$]$} for the so-called normal mass ordering and {$[$}−2.54, −0.32{$]$} for the inverted mass ordering. Our results indicate CP violation in leptons and our method enables sensitive searches for matter--antimatter asymmetry in neutrino oscillations using accelerator-produced neutrino beams. Future measurements with larger datasets will test whether leptonic CP violation is larger than the CP violation in quarks.},

In particular, we report improvements made in our calibration methods for the experimental phase IV in which new readout electronics have been operating since 2008. The topics are separated into two parts. The first part describes the determination of constants needed to interpret the digitized output of our electronics so that we can obtain physical numbers such as photon counts and their arrival times for each photomultiplier tube (PMT). In this context, we developed an in situ procedure to determine high-voltage settings for PMTs in large detectors like SK, as well as a new method for measuring PMT quantum efficiency and gain in such a detector. The second part describes modeling of the detector in Monte Carlo simulations, including, in particular, the optical properties of the water target and their variability over time. Detailed studies on water quality are also presented. As a result of this work, we have achieved a precision sufficient for physics analyses over a wide energy range (from a few MeV to above 1TeV). For example, charge determination was at the level of 1\%, and the timing resolution was 2.1ns at the one-photoelectron charge level and 0.5ns at the 100-photoelectron charge level.}

In the T2K experiment, we generate a muon neutrino beam using the 50-GeV proton synchrotron in J-PARC and detect it in the Super-Kamiokande detector, which is 295km away from J-PARC. We aim the neutrino beam off-axis by 2.5$\,^{\circ}$ from Super-Kamiokande in order to maximize the sensitivity to the neutrino oscillation measurement. Since the beam direction is required to be aimed within 1mrad, we need to monitor it with a precision better than 1mrad. The muon monitor is the only instrument that can monitor the neutrino beam direction in real time by measuring a profile of muons which are generated along with neutrinos. It is required to measure the intense muon beam precisely and stably in a high radiation area. Therefore, we use two independent systems for the muon monitor: an array of ionization chambers and another array of solid-state detectors. We developed the ionization chamber and performed beam tests with an electron beam at the Laboratory of Particle Beam Science in Kyoto University. We also had a long-term test in the NuMI beamline at Fermilab. Then we finalized the design of the ionization chamber and built it. We expect the ionization chambers as the muon monitor to monitor the beam direction with a precision of 0.2mrad.},

Data values (generally of more than one dimension) are binned, and because the numbers of data points in many bins are small, a χ2 minimisation is inappropriate, so a maximum likelihood technique using Poisson statistics is often used. This note shows how to incorporate the fact that the Monte Carlo statistics used are finite and thus subject to statistical fluctuations."

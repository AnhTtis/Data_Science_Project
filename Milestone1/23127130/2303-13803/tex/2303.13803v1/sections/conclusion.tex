\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented \sysname, the first production DL cluster system for efficient and safe space-sharing.
\sysname ensures the performance of online workloads from both workload level and GPU level.
To guarantee the safety of online workloads, \sysname leverages a mixed error-handling mechanism based on the analysis of production errors.
Furthermore, \sysname exploits dynamical SM allocation and matching-based scheduling to improve the efficiency of offline workloads.
The evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of \sysname.
Particularly, \sysname has been already deployed in the production DL clusters at \company with more than 20,000 GPUs.

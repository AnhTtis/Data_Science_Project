abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.}

	journal = {Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment},
	abstract = {An algorithm for the simulation of the evolution of slightly entangled quantum states has been recently proposed as a tool to study time-dependent phenomena in one-dimensional quantum systems. Its key feature is a time-evolving block-decimation (TEBD) procedure to identify and dynamically update the relevant, conveniently small, subregion of the otherwise exponentially large Hilbert space. Potential applications of the TEBD algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm, being based on updating a matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the DMRG community and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG techniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG implementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile ‘adaptive time-dependent DMRG’ variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.}

  abstract = {Analog quantum simulation has the potential to be an indispensable technique in the investigation of complex quantum systems. In this work, we numerically investigate a one-dimensional, faithful, analog, quantum electronic circuit simulator built out of Josephson junctions for one of the paradigmatic models of an integrable quantum field theory: the quantum sine-Gordon (qSG) model in 1+1 space-time dimensions. We analyze the lattice model using the density matrix renormalization group technique and benchmark our numerical results with existing Bethe ansatz computations. Furthermore, we perform analytical form-factor calculations for the two-point correlation function of vertex operators, which closely agree with our numerical computations. Finally, we compute the entanglement spectrum of the qSG model. We compare our results with those obtained using the integrable lattice-regularization based on the quantum XYZ chain and show that the quantum circuit model is less susceptible to corrections to scaling compared to the XYZ chain. We provide numerical evidence that the parameters required to realize the qSG model are accessible with modern-day superconducting circuit technology, thus providing additional credence towards the viability of the latter platform for simulating strongly interacting quantum field theories.},

  abstract = {The general properties of the factorized S-matrix in two-dimensional space-time are considered. The relation between the factorization property of the scattering theory and the infinite number of conservation laws of the underlying field theory is discussed. The factorization of the total S-matrix is shown to impose hard restrictions on two-particle matrix elements: they should satisfy special identities, the so-called factorization equations. The general solution of the unitarity, crossing and factorization equations is found for the S-matrices having isotopic O(N)-symmetry. The solution turns out to have different properties for the cases N = 2 and N ⩾ 3. For N = 2 the general solution depends on one parameter (of coupling constant type), whereas the solution for N ⩾ 3 has no parameters but depends analytically on N. The solution for N = 2 is shown to be an exact soliton S-matrix of the sine-Gordon model (equivalently the massive Thirring model). The total S-matrix of the model is constructed. In the case of N ⩾ 3 there are two “minimum” solutions, i.e., those having a minimum set of singularities. One of them is shown to be an exact S matrix of the quantum O(N)-symmetric nonlinear σ-model, the other is argued to describe the scattering of elementary particles of the Gross-Neveu model.},

For the bulk part of the free energy we find agreement with Lukyanov’s result (1998 Nucl. Phys. B 522 533). In the boundary part we obtain a cut-off independent term which is linear in T and determines the temperature dependence of the boundary susceptibility in the attractive regime for . We further show that at particular anisotropies where contributions from irrelevant operators with different scaling dimensions cross, logarithmic corrections appear. We give explicit formulae for these terms at those anisotropies where they are most important. We verify our results by comparing with extensive numerical calculations based on a numerical solution of the T = 0 Bethe ansatz equations, the finite temperature Bethe ansatz equations in the quantum transfer matrix formalism, and the density matrix renormalization group applied to transfer matrices.},

In particular, within a semiclassical approximation, we compute correlation functions for the relative phase which are experimentally measurable and we observe a transient regime displaying oscillations as a function of the distance. The steady regime is very well approximated by a thermal state with a temperature independent of the tunneling strength.},

    abstract = { A finite isolated system should return almost to its initial state if it evolves for long enough. For a large system, “long enough” is often unfeasibly long. Rauer et al. found just the right conditions to observe the recurrence of the initial state in a system of two one-dimensional superfluids with thousands of atoms in each. The superfluids were initially coupled—locking their quantum mechanical phases together—and then allowed to evolve independently. After the uncoupling, the researchers observed their phases regaining coherence two more times. Science, this issue p. 307 Two 1D superfluids in box potentials are used to show the recurrence of coherence in a system with thousands of particles. The complexity of interacting quantum many-body systems leads to exceedingly long recurrence times of the initial quantum state for all but the smallest systems. For large systems, one cannot probe the full quantum state in all its details. Thus, experimentally, recurrences can only be determined on the level of the accessible observables. Realizing a commensurate spectrum of collective excitations in one-dimensional superfluids, we demonstrate recurrences of coherence and long-range order in an interacting quantum many-body system containing thousands of particles. Our findings will enable the study of the coherent dynamics of large quantum systems even after they have reached a transient thermal-like state. }

Success in both of these pursuits requires the development of atom-optical elements that can manipulate matter waves at the same time as preserving their coherence and phase. Here, we present an integrated interferometer based on a simple, coherent matter-wave beam splitter constructed on an atom chip. Through the use of radio-frequency-induced adiabatic double-well potentials, we demonstrate the splitting of Bose--Einstein condensates into two clouds separated by distances ranging from 3 to 80 $\mu$m, enabling access to both tunnelling and isolated regimes. Moreover, by analysing the interference patterns formed by combining two clouds of ultracold atoms originating from a single condensate, we measure the deterministic phase evolution throughout the splitting process. We show that we can control the relative phase between the two fully separated samples and that our beam splitter is phase-preserving.},

    abstract = { When a physical system is subjected to a rapid change of conditions (for example, a gas of atoms is allowed to occupy a volume twice the size of the original container), it quickly achieves a new temperature (thermalizes) through collisions. However, in some quantum systems many conserved variables inhibit thermalization; understanding the phases the systems go through in the slowing process is of great interest to cosmologists and physicists. Gring et al. (p. 1318, published online 31 August) separate an ultracold one-dimensional gas of bosonic atoms into two nearly identical halves, and follow how local differences in phase between the halves evolve in time by examining their interference. Initially, the local phases are almost identical, but a rapid decoherence ensues, followed by a very slow further decay. The authors analyze the relative state reached after the initial fast decay and find that it can be described by an equilibrium function with an effective temperature several times less than the initial temperature. Because this cannot be the final state of the system, the authors term the initial process prethermalization. Two halves of a split ultracold gas of rubidium atoms retain memory of the initial state for an extended time. Understanding relaxation processes is an important unsolved problem in many areas of physics. A key challenge is the scarcity of experimental tools for the characterization of complex transient states. We used measurements of full quantum mechanical probability distributions of matter-wave interference to study the relaxation dynamics of a coherently split one-dimensional Bose gas and obtained comprehensive information about the dynamical states of the system. After an initial rapid evolution, the full distributions reveal the approach toward a thermal-like steady state characterized by an effective temperature that is independent from the initial equilibrium temperature of the system before the splitting process. We conjecture that this state can be described through a generalized Gibbs ensemble and associate it with prethermalization. }

    abstract = { Most people have an intuitive understanding of temperature. In the context of statistical mechanics, the higher the temperature, the more a system is removed from its lowest energy state. Things become more complicated in a nonequilibrium system governed by quantum mechanics and constrained by several conserved quantities. Langen et al. showed that as many as 10 temperature-like parameters are necessary to describe the steady state of a one-dimensional gas of Rb atoms that was split into two in a particular way (see the Perspective by Spielman). Science, this issue p. 207; see also p. 185 Interferometry suggests that as many as 10 parameters are needed to describe the steady state of an integrable system. [Also see Perspective by Spielman] The description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum many-body systems within the framework of statistical mechanics is a fundamental open question. Conventional thermodynamical ensembles fail to describe the large class of systems that exhibit nontrivial conserved quantities, and generalized ensembles have been predicted to maximize entropy in these systems. We show experimentally that a degenerate one-dimensional Bose gas relaxes to a state that can be described by such a generalized ensemble. This is verified through a detailed study of correlation functions up to 10th order. The applicability of the generalized ensemble description for isolated quantum many-body systems points to a natural emergence of classical statistical properties from the microscopic unitary quantum evolution. }

abstract={One of the manifestations of relativistic invariance in non-equilibrium quantum field theory is the ``horizon effect'' a.k.a. light-cone spreading of correlations: starting from an initially short-range correlated state, measurements of two observers at distant space-time points are expected to remain independent until their past light-cones overlap. Surprisingly, we find that in the presence of topological excitations correlations can develop outside of horizon and indeed even between infinitely distant points. We demonstrate this effect for a wide class of global quantum quenches to the sine-Gordon model. We point out that besides the maximum velocity bound implied by relativistic invariance, clustering of initial correlations is required to establish the ``horizon effect''. We show that quenches in the sine-Gordon model have an interesting property: despite the fact that the initial states have exponentially decaying correlations and cluster in terms of the bosonic fields, they violate the clustering condition for the soliton fields, which is argued to be related to the non-trivial field topology. The nonlinear dynamics governed by the solitons makes the clustering violation manifest also in correlations of the local bosonic fields after the quench.},

The results are obtained using Haldane's harmonic-fluid approach (also known as ‘bosonization’), and are valid for both bosons and fermions, in weakly and strongly interacting regimes. The harmonic-fluid approach and the method of computing the correlation functions using conformal transformations are explained in great detail. As an application relevant to one-dimensional systems of cold atomic gases, we consider the model of bosons interacting with a zero-range potential. The Luttinger-liquid parameters are obtained from the exact solution by solving the Bethe-ansatz equations in finite-size systems. The range of applicability of the approach is discussed, and the prefactor of the one-body density matrix of bosons is fixed by finding an appropriate parametrization of the weak-coupling result. The formula thus obtained is shown to be accurate, when compared with recent diffusion Monte Carlo calculations, within less than 1\%. The experimental implications of these results for Bragg scattering experiments at low and high momenta are also discussed.}

The procedure is carried out in detail for double sine-Gordon theory, where the vacuum energy density and breather mass correction is evaluated at second order. The results agree with those obtained from the truncated conformal space approach. The regularization procedure can also be used to compute other spectral sums involving disconnected pieces of form factors such as those that occur e.g. in finite temperature correlators.}

This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.}

In this review, we summarize recent efforts to take into account small integrability breaking terms, and describe the transition from GHD to standard hydrodynamics. We discuss the current state of the art, with emphasis on weakly inhomogeneous potentials, generalized Boltzmann equations and collision integrals, as well as bound-state recombination effects.

abstract={A particular strength of ultracold quantum gases is the range of versatile detection methods that are available. As they are based on atom--light interactions, the whole quantum optics toolbox can be used to tailor the detection process to the specific scientific question to be explored in the experiment. Common methods include time-of-flight measurements to access the momentum distribution of the gas, the use of cavities to monitor global properties of the quantum gas with minimal disturbance, and phase-contrast or high-intensity absorption imaging to obtain local real-space information in high-density settings. Even the ultimate limit of detecting each and every atom locally has been realized in two dimensions using so-called quantum gas microscopes. In fact, these microscopes have not only revolutionized detection---they have also revolutionized the control of lattice gases. Here, we provide a short overview of quantum gas microscopy, highlighting the new observables it can access as well as key experiments that have been enabled by its development.},

abstract={Engineering optical lattices with laser-induced tunnelling amplitudes has enabled the realization of artificial magnetic fields with remarkable tunability. Here, we report on the observation of chiral Meissner currents in bosonic ladders exposed to a strong artificial magnetic field. By suddenly decoupling the individual ladders and projecting into isolated double wells, we are able to measure the currents on each side of the ladder. For large coupling strengths along the rungs of the ladder, we find a saturated maximum chiral current, which is analogous to the surface currents in the Meissner effect. Below a critical inter-leg coupling strength, the chiral current decreases in good agreement with our expectations for a vortex lattice phase. Our realization of a low-dimensional Meissner-like effect and spin--orbit coupling in one dimension opens the path to exploring interacting particles in low dimensions exposed to a uniform magnetic field.},

    "abstract": "In this work we provide detailed estimates of maximal principal angles\nbetween subspaces and we analyze their smoothness for smoothly varying\nsubspaces. This leads to a new definition of angular values for linear\ndynamical systems in continuous time. We derive some of their properties\ncomplementary to the theory of angular values developed in [W.-J. Beyn, G.\nFroyland, and T. H\\\"uls, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 21 (2022), pp. 1245--1286],\n[W.-J. Beyn, and T. H\\\"uls, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 22 (2023), pp. 162--198]\nfor discrete time systems. The estimates are further employed to establish\nupper semicontinuity of angular values for some parametric model examples of\ndiscrete and continuous type.",

    "abstract": "As an emerging concept cognitive learning model, partial order formal structure analysis (POFSA) has been widely used in the field of knowledge processing. In this paper, we propose the method named three-way causal attribute partial order structure (3WCAPOS) to evolve the POFSA from set coverage to causal coverage in order to increase the interpretability and classification performance of the model. First, the concept of causal factor (CF) is proposed to evaluate the causal correlation between attributes and decision attributes in the formal decision context. Then, combining CF with attribute partial order structure, the concept of causal attribute partial order structure is defined and makes set coverage evolve into causal coverage. Finally, combined with the idea of three-way decision, 3WCAPOS is formed, which makes the purity of nodes in the structure clearer and the changes between levels more obviously. In addition, the experiments are carried out from the classification ability and the interpretability of the structure through the six datasets. Through these experiments, it is concluded the accuracy of 3WCAPOS is improved by 1% - 9% compared with classification and regression tree, and more interpretable and the processing of knowledge is more reasonable compared with attribute partial order structure.",

	abstract = {This paper compares the performance of penalty and Lagrange multiplier approaches for the necessary unit-length constraint in the computation of liquid crystal equilibrium configurations. Building on previous work in [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 37 (2015), pp. S157--S176; SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 53 (2015), pp. 2226--2254], the penalty method is derived and well-posedness of the linearizations within the nonlinear iteration is discussed. In addition, the paper considers the effects of tailored trust-region methods in the context of finite-element discretizations and nested iteration for both formulations. Such methods are aimed at increasing the efficiency and robustness of each algorithm's nonlinear iterations. Three representative elastic equilibrium problems are considered to examine each method's performance. The first two configurations have analytical expressions for their exact solutions and, therefore, convergence to the true solution is considered. The third problem considers complicated boundary conditions, relevant in ongoing research, simulating surface nano-patterning. Finally, a novel multigrid scheme is introduced and tested for electrically and flexoelectrically coupled models to establish scalability for highly complicated applications. The Lagrange multiplier method is found to outperform the penalty method in a number of measures, the developed trust regions are shown to improve robustness, and nested iteration proves highly effective at reducing computational costs.},

@article{AttouchChbaniFadiliRiahi2019,
	abstract = {In a Hilbert space setting, for convex optimization, we analyze the convergence rate of a class of first-order algorithms involving inertial features. They can be interpreted as discrete time versions of inertial dynamics involving both viscous and Hessian-driven dampings. The geometrical damping driven by the Hessian intervenes in the dynamics in the form r2f (x(t))x\textperiodcentered{} (t). By treating this term as the time derivative of rf (x(t)), this gives, in discretized form, first-order algorithms in time and space. In addition to the convergence properties attached to Nesterov-type accelerated gradient methods, the algorithms thus obtained are new and show a rapid convergence towards zero of the gradients. On the basis of a regularization technique using the Moreau envelope, we extend these methods to non-smooth convex functions with extended real values. The introduction of time scale factors makes it possible to further accelerate these algorithms. We also report numerical results on structured problems to support our theoretical findings.},

As a new result, in the one-dimensional framework, for the critical value \$\textbackslash alpha = 3 \$, we prove the convergence of the trajectories without any restrictive hypothesis on the convex function \$\textbackslash Phi \$. In the second part of this paper, we study the convergence properties of the associated forward-backward inertial algorithms. They aim to solve structured convex minimization problems of the form \$\textbackslash min \textbackslash left\textbackslash lbrace \textbackslash Theta:= \textbackslash Phi + \textbackslash Psi \textbackslash right\textbackslash rbrace\$, with \$\textbackslash Phi\$ smooth and \$\textbackslash Psi\$ nonsmooth. The continuous dynamics serves as a guideline for this study. We obtain a similar rate of convergence for the sequence of iterates \$(x\_k)\$: for \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash leq 3\$ we have \$\textbackslash Theta (x\_k)-\textbackslash min \textbackslash Theta = \textbackslash mathcal O (k\^\{-p\})\$ for all \$p {$<\backslash$}frac\{2\textbackslash alpha\}\{3\}\$ , and for \$\textbackslash alpha {$>$} 3\$ \textbackslash{} \$\textbackslash Theta (x\_k)-\textbackslash min \textbackslash Theta = o (k\^\{-2\})\$ .

An interesting property of this system is that, after introduction of an auxiliary variable y , it can be equivalently written as a firstorder system involving only the time derivatives u\textperiodcentered{} , y\textperiodcentered{} and the gradient operators {$\nabla\Phi$} , {$\nabla\Psi$} . This allows to extend our analysis to the case of a convex lower semicontinuous function {$\Phi$} : H \textrightarrow{} R {$\cup$} \{+{$\infty\rbrace$} , and so to introduce constraints in our model. When {$\Phi$} = {$\delta$}K is the indicator function of a closed convex set K {$\subseteq$} H , the subdifferential operator {$\partial$} {$\Phi$} takes account of the contact forces, while {$\nabla\Psi$} takes account of the driving forces. In this setting, by playing with the geometrical damping parameter {$\beta$} , we can describe nonelastic shock laws with restitution coefficient. Taking advantage of the infinite dimensional framework, we introduce a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE describing a damped oscillating system with obstacle. The first-order system is dissipative; each trajectory weakly converges to a minimizer of {$\Phi$} + {$\Psi$} , provided that {$\Phi$} and {$\Phi$} + {$\Psi$} are convex functions.

The analysis is performed with the Heavy-ball tuned to achieve the best convergence rate on the sub-class of quadratic functions. We review recent work to characterize convergence rate upper bounds for optimization algorithms using integral quadratic constraints (IQC). This yields a linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition which is typically solved numerically to obtain convergence rate bounds. We construct an analytical solution for this LMI condition using a specific ``weighted off-by-one'' IQC. We also construct a specific objective function such that the Heavy-ball algorithm enters a limit cycle. These results demonstrate that IQC condition is tight for the analysis of the tuned Heavy-ball, i.e. it yields the exact condition ratio that separates global convergence from non-global convergence for the algorithm.},

The fact that one of the subproblems to be solved within the iteration process of this method does not usually correspond to the calculation of a proximal operator through a closed formula affects the implementability of the algorithm. In this paper, we allow in each block of the objective a further smooth convex function and propose a proximal version of the algorithm, which is achieved by equipping the algorithm with proximal terms induced by variable metrics. For suitable choices of the latter, the solving of the two subproblems in the iterative scheme can be reduced to the computation of proximal operators. We investigate the convergence of the proposed algorithm in a real Hilbert space setting and illustrate its numerical performances on two applications in image processing and machine learning.},

When the function {$\varphi$} is assumed to be strongly convex, we can even show strong convergence of the trajectories. The results can be seen as the second-order counterparts of the ones given by Attouch and Czarnecki (Journal of Differential Equations 248(6), 1315\textendash 1344, 2010) for first-order dynamical systems associated to the constrained variational inequalities.

In this context, the capabilities of statistical machine learning methods is limited by the computing time rather than the sample size. A more precise analysis uncovers qualitatively different tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-scale learning problems. The large-scale case involves the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithm in non-trivial ways. Unlikely optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent show amazing performance for large-scale problems.

Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.},

Starting from the fundamental theory of black-box optimization, the material progresses towards recent advances in structural optimization and stochastic optimization. Our presentation of black-box optimization, strongly influenced by the seminal book of Nesterov, includes the analysis of the Ellipsoid Method, as well as (accelerated) gradient descent schemes. We also pay special attention to non-Euclidean settings (relevant algorithms include Frank-Wolfe, Mirror Descent, and Dual Averaging) and discuss their relevance in machine learning. We provide a gentle introduction to structural optimization with FISTA (to optimize a sum of a smooth and a simple non-smooth term), SaddlePoint Mirror Prox (Nemirovski's alternative to Nesterov's smoothing), and a concise description of Interior Point Methods. In stochastic optimization we discuss Stochastic Gradient Descent, mini-batches, Random Coordinate Descent, and sublinear algorithms. We also briefly touch upon convex relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to round solutions, as well as random walks based methods.},

The model minimization may be done approximately with a dogleg-type approach. We show that this method is globally convergent even if singular or indefinite Hessian approximations are made. A second order correction step that brings the iterates closer to the feasible set is described. If sufficiently precise Hessian information is used, this correction step allows us to prove that the method is also locally quadratically convergent, and that the limit satisfies the second order necessary conditions for constrained optimization. An example is given to show that, without this correction, a situation similar to the Maratos effect may occur where the iteration is unable to move away from a saddle point.},

Our major goal is to improve the convergence of SVRG-style stochastic algorithms to stationary points under a setting with a large condition number \$c\$ - the ratio between the smoothness constant and the negative curvature constant. The proposed algorithm achieves the best known gradient complexity when \$c\textbackslash geq \textbackslash Omega(n)\$, which was achieved previously by a SAGA-style accelerated stochastic algorithm. Compared with the SAGA-style accelerated stochastic algorithm, the proposed algorithm is more practical due to its low memory cost that is inherited from previous SVRG-style algorithms. Compared with previous studies on SVRG-style stochastic algorithms, our theory provides much stronger results in terms of (i) reduced gradient complexity under a large condition number; and (ii) that the convergence is proved for a sampled stagewise averaged solution that is selected from all stagewise averaged solutions with increasing sampling probabilities instead of for a uniformly sampled solutions across all iterations.},

In this work, we show that a wide class of stochastic optimization algorithms for strongly convex problems can be augmented with high confidence bounds at an overhead cost that is only logarithmic in the confidence level and polylogarithmic in the condition number. The procedure we propose, called proxBoost, is elementary and builds on two well-known ingredients: robust distance estimation and the proximal point method.

The main result generalizes Powell's 1975 result for unconstrained trust-region algorithms.The trial step is characterized by very mild conditions on its normal and tangential components. The normal component need not be computed accurately. The theory requires a quasi-normal component to satisfy a fraction of Cauchy decrease condition on the quadratic model of the linearized constraints. The tangential component then must satisfy a fraction of Cauchy decrease condition on a quadratic model of the Lagrangian function in the translated tangent space of the constraints determined by the quasi-normal component. Estimates of the Lagrange multipliers and the Hessians are assumed only to be bounded.The other main characteristic of this class of algorithms is that the step is evaluated by using the augmented Lagrangian as a merit function with the penalty parameter updated using the El-Alem scheme. The properties of the step and the way that the penalty parameter is chosen are sufficient to establish global convergence.As an example, an algorithm is presented that can be viewed as a generalization of the Steihaug--Toint dogleg algorithm for the unconstrained case. It is based on a quadratic programming algorithm that uses a step in a quasi-normal direction to the tangent space of the constraints and then takes feasible conjugate reduced-gradient steps to solve the reduced quadratic program. This algorithm should cope quite well with large problems for which effective preconditioners are known.},

We first prove the convergence of Bregman Stochastic Gradient Descent (BSGD) to a region that depends on the noise (magnitude of the gradients) at the optimum. In particular, BSGD with a constant step-size converges to the exact minimizer when this noise is zero (interpolation setting, in which the data is fit perfectly). Otherwise, when the objective has a finite sum structure, we show that variance reduction can be used to counter the effect of noise. In particular, fast convergence to the exact minimizer can be obtained under additional regularity assumptions on the Bregman reference function. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on two key applications of relative smoothness: tomographic reconstruction with Poisson noise and statistical preconditioning for distributed optimization.},

The key to our analysis is a new connection between bias and variance in stochastic gradient estimators, suggesting a new form of bias-variance tradeoff in stochastic optimisation. This connection allows us to provide simple convergence proofs for biased algorithms, extend proximal support to biased algorithms for the first time in the convex setting, and show that biased gradient estimators often offer theoretical advantages over unbiased estimators. We propose two algorithms, B-SAGA and B-SVRG, that incorporate bias into the SAGA and SVRG gradient estimators and analyse them using our framework. Our analysis shows that the bias in the B-SAGA and B-SVRG gradient estimators decreases their meansquared errors and improves their performance in certain settings.},

	abstract = {We introduce a novel approach for analyzing the worst-case performance of first-order black-box optimization methods. We focus on smooth unconstrained convex minimization over the Euclidean space. Our approach relies on the observation that by definition, the worst-case behavior of a black-box optimization method is by itself an optimization problem, which we call the performance estimation problem (PEP). We formulate and analyze the PEP for two classes of first-order algorithms. We first apply this approach on the classical gradient method and derive a new and tight analytical bound on its performance. We then consider a broader class of first-order black-box methods, which among others, include the so-called heavy-ball method and the fast gradient schemes. We show that for this broader class, it is possible to derive new bounds on the performance of these methods by solving an adequately relaxed convex semidefinite PEP. Finally, we show an efficient procedure for finding optimal step sizes which results in a first-order black-box method that achieves best worst-case performance.},

Here we consider problems with general inequality constraints (linear and nonlinear). We assume that first derivatives are available and that the constraint gradients are sparse. Second derivatives are assumed to be unavailable or too expensive to calculate. We discuss an SQP algorithm that uses a smooth augmented Lagrangian merit function and makes explicit provision for infeasibility in the original problem and the QP subproblems. The Hessian of the Lagrangian is approximated using a limited-memory quasi-Newton method. SNOPT is a particular implementation that uses a reduced-Hessian semidefinite QP solver (SQOPT) for the QP subproblems. It is designed for problems with many thousands of constraints and variables but is best suited for problems with a moderate number of degrees of freedom (say, up to 2000). Numerical results are given for most of the CUTEr and COPS test collections (about 1020 examples of all sizes up to 40000 constraints and variables, and up to 20000 degrees of freedom).},

As a result, one of its subproblems decouples the objective function and the coefficient matrix without any extra condition, and the other subproblem becomes a positive definite system of linear equations or a positive definite linear complementary problem. The balanced ALM advances the classic ALM by enlarging its applicable range, balancing its subproblems, and improving its implementation. We also extend our discussion to two-block and multiple-block separable convex programming models, and accordingly design various splitting versions of the balanced ALM for these separable models. Convergence analysis for the balanced ALM and its splitting versions is conducted in the context of variational inequalities through the lens of the classic proximal point algorithm.},

	abstract = {We propose a fast second-order method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for current deep learning solvers. Compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), it only requires two additional forward-mode automatic differentiation operations per iteration, which has a computational cost comparable to two standard forward passes and is easy to implement. Our method addresses long-standing issues with current second-order solvers, which invert an approximate Hessian matrix every iteration exactly or by conjugategradient methods, procedures that are much slower than a SGD step. Instead, we propose to keep a single estimate of the gradient projected by the inverse Hessian matrix, and update it once per iteration with just two passes over the network. This estimate has the same size and is similar to the momentum variable that is commonly used in SGD. No estimate of the Hessian is maintained. We first validate our method, called CURVEBALL, on small problems with known solutions (noisy Rosenbrock function and degenerate 2-layer linear networks), where current deep learning solvers struggle. We then train several large models on CIFAR and ImageNet, including ResNet and VGG-f networks, where we demonstrate faster convergence with no hyperparameter tuning. We also show our optimiser's generality by testing on a large set of randomly-generated architectures.},

Variance reduction techniques such as SAG, SVRG and SAGA have been proposed to overcome this weakness, achieving linear convergence. However, these methods are either based on computations of full gradients at pivot points, or on keeping per data point corrections in memory. Therefore speed-ups relative to SGD may need a minimal number of epochs in order to materialize. This paper investigates algorithms that can exploit neighborhood structure in the training data to share and re-use information about past stochastic gradients across data points, which offers advantages in the transient optimization phase. As a side-product we provide a unified convergence analysis for a family of variance reduction algorithms, which we call memorization algorithms.

	abstract = {Adaptive multilevel finite element methods are developed and analyzed for certain elliptic systems arising in geometric analysis and general relativity. This class of nonlinear elliptic systems of tensor equations on manifolds is first reviewed, and then adaptive multilevel fi- nite element methods for approximating solutions to this class of problems are considered in some detail. Two a posteriori error indicators are derived, based on local residuals and on global linearized adjoint or dual problems. The design of Manifold Code (MC) is then dis- cussed; MC is an adaptive multilevel finite element software package for 2- and 3-manifolds developed over several years at Caltech and UC San Diego. It employs a posteriori error estimation, adaptive simplex subdivision, unstructured algebraic multilevel methods, global inexact Newton methods, and numerical continuation methods for the numerical solution of nonlinear covariant elliptic systems on 2- and 3-manifolds. Some of the more interesting fea- tures of MC are described in detail, including some new ideas for topology and geometry representation in simplex meshes, and an unusual partition of unity-based method for exploit- ing parallel computers. A short example is then given which involves the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints in the Einstein equations, a representative nonlinear 4-component co- variant elliptic system on a Riemannian 3-manifold which arises in general relativity. A num- ber of operator properties and solvability results recently established in [55] are first summa- rized, making possible two quasi-optimal a priori error estimates for Galerkin approximations which are then derived. These two results complete the theoretical framework for effective use of adaptive multilevel finite element methods. A sample calculation using the MC soft- ware is then presented; more detailed examples using MC for this application may be found in [26].},

First, we show an intrinsic connection between stochastic optimization methods and dynamic jump systems, and propose a general jump system model for stochastic optimization methods. Our proposed model recovers SAGA, SDCA, Finito, and SAG as special cases. Then we combine jump system theory with several simple quadratic inequalities to derive sufficient conditions for convergence rate certifications of the proposed jump system model under various assumptions (with or without individual convexity, etc). The derived conditions are linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose size roughly scale with the size of the training set. We make use of the symmetry in the stochastic optimization methods and reduce these LMIs to some equivalent small LMIs whose sizes are at most 3 \texttimes{} 3. We solve these small LMIs to provide analytical proofs of new convergence rates for SAGA, Finito and SDCA (with or without individual convexity). We also explain why our proposed LMI fails in analyzing SAG. We reveal a key difference between SAG and other methods, and briefly discuss how to extend our LMI analysis for SAG. An advantage of our approach is that the proposed analysis can be automated for a large class of stochastic methods under various assumptions (with or without individual convexity, etc).},

For both the IID and Markov noise cases, we show that the evolution of some augmented versions of the mean and covariance matrix of TD learning exactly follows the trajectory of a deterministic linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical system. Applying the well-known LTI system theory, we obtain closed-form expressions for the mean and covariance matrix of TD learning at any time step. We provide a tight matrix spectral radius condition to guarantee the convergence of the covariance matrix of TD learning, and perform a perturbation analysis to characterize the dependence of the TD behaviors on learning rate. For the IID case, we provide an exact formula characterizing how the mean and covariance matrix of TD learning converge to the steady state values at a linear rate. For the Markov case, we use our formulas to explain how the behaviors of TD learning algorithms are affected by learning rate and various properties of the underlying Markov chain.},

The tools discussed here allow us to automate the convergence analysis of SVRG-like methods by capturing their essential properties in small semidefinite programs amenable to standard analysis and computational techniques.

Parallel computers with large storage capacities are paving the way for high-resolution simulations of coupled problems; however, hardware improvements alone will not prove enough to enable simulations based on brute-force algorithmic approaches. To accurately capture nonlinear couplings between dynamically relevant phenomena, often while stepping over rapid adjustments to quasi-equilibria, simulation scientists are increasingly turning to implicit formulations that require a discrete nonlinear system to be solved for each time step or steady state solution. Recent advances in iterative methods have made fully implicit formulations a viable option for solution of these large-scale problems. In this paper, we overview one of the most effective iterative methods, Newton-Krylov, for nonlinear systems and point to software packages with its implementation. We illustrate the method with an example from magnetically confined plasma fusion and briefly survey other areas in which implicit methods have bestowed important advantages, such as allowing high-order temporal integration and providing a pathway to sensitivity analyses and optimization. Lastly, we overview algorithm extensions under development motivated by current SciDAC applications.},

This approach is particularly attractive because it escapes strict saddle points and it provides stronger convergence guarantees than first- and second-order as well as classical trust region methods. However, it suffers from a high computational complexity that makes it impractical for large-scale learning. Here, we propose a novel method that uses sub-sampling to lower this computational cost. By the use of concentration inequalities we provide a sampling scheme that gives sufficiently accurate gradient and Hessian approximations to retain the strong global and local convergence guarantees of cubically regularized methods.

	abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of minimizing the average of a large number (n) of smooth convex loss functions. We propose a new method, S2GD (Semi-Stochastic Gradient Descent), which runs for one or several epochs in each of which a single full gradient and a random number of stochastic gradients is computed, following a geometric law. The total work needed for the method to output an {$\epsilon$}-accurate solution in expectation, measured in the number of passes over data, or equivalently, in units equivalent to the computation of a single gradient of the loss, is O(({$\kappa$}/n) log(1/{$\epsilon$})), where {$\kappa$} is the condition number. This is achieved by running the method for O(log(1/{$\epsilon$})) epochs, with a single gradient evaluation and O({$\kappa$}) stochastic gradient evaluations in each. The SVRG method of Johnson and Zhang [3] arises as a special case. If our method is limited to a single epoch only, it needs to evaluate at most O(({$\kappa$}/{$\epsilon$}) log(1/{$\epsilon$})) stochastic gradients. In contrast, SVRG requires O({$\kappa$}/{$\epsilon$}2) stochastic gradients. To illustrate our theoretical results, S2GD only needs the workload equivalent to about 2.1 full gradient evaluations to find an 10-6-accurate solution for a problem with n = 109 and {$\kappa$} = 103.},

@article{konecnyStochasticDistributedFederated2017,
	abstract = {We study optimization algorithms for the finite sum problems frequently arising in machine learning applications. First, we propose novel variants of stochastic gradient descent with a variance reduction property that enables linear convergence for strongly convex objectives. Second, we study distributed setting, in which the data describing the optimization problem does not fit into a single computing node. In this case, traditional methods are inefficient, as the communication costs inherent in distributed optimization become the bottleneck. We propose a communication-efficient framework which iteratively forms local subproblems that can be solved with arbitrary local optimization algorithms. Finally, we introduce the concept of Federated Optimization/Learning, where we try to solve the machine learning problems without having data stored in any centralized manner. The main motivation comes from industry when handling user-generated data. The current prevalent practice is that companies collect vast amounts of user data and store them in datacenters. An alternative we propose is not to collect the data in first place, and instead occasionally use the computational power of users' devices to solve the very same optimization problems, while alleviating privacy concerns at the same time. In such setting, minimization of communication rounds is the primary goal, and we demonstrate that solving the optimization problems in such circumstances is conceptually tractable.},

Moreover, as a main source of examples, in analogy to the classical setting, we introduce relatively amenable functions by invoking the recently proposed notion of smooth adaptability or relative smoothness.

Three common orderings are cyclic (CCD), in which we cycle through the components of \$x\$ in order; randomized (RCD), in which the component to update is selected randomly and independently at each iteration; and random-permutations cyclic (RPCD), which differs from CCD only in that a random permutation is applied to the variables at the start of each cycle. Known convergence guarantees are weaker for CCD and RPCD than for RCD, though in most practical cases, computational performance is similar among all these variants. There is a certain type of quadratic function for which CCD is significantly slower than for RCD; a recent paper by \textbackslash cite\{SunY16a\} has explored the poor behavior of CCD on functions of this type. The RPCD approach performs well on these functions, even better than RCD in a certain regime. This paper explains the good behavior of RPCD with a tight analysis.},

	abstract = {Given an optimization problem, the Hessian matrix and its eigenspectrum can be used in many ways, ranging from designing more efficient second-order algorithms to performing model analysis and regression diagnostics. When nonlinear models and non-convex problems are considered, strong simplifying assumptions are often made to make Hessian spectral analysis more tractable. This leads to the question of how relevant the conclusions of such analyses are for more realistic nonlinear models. In this paper, we exploit deterministic equivalent techniques from random matrix theory to make a precise characterization of the Hessian eigenspectra for a broad family of nonlinear models, including models that generalize the classical generalized linear models, without relying on strong simplifying assumptions used previously. We show that, depending on the data properties, the nonlinear response model, and the loss function, the Hessian can have qualitatively different spectral behaviors: of bounded or unbounded support, with single- or multi-bulk, and with isolated eigenvalues on the left- or right-hand side of the bulk. By focusing on such a simple but nontrivial nonlinear model, our analysis takes a step forward to unveil the theoretical origin of many visually striking features observed in more complex machine learning models.},

One of the keys to achieve acceleration in theory and in practice is to solve these sub-problems with appropriate accuracy by using the right stopping criterion and the right warm-start strategy. We give practical guidelines to use Catalyst and present a comprehensive analysis of its global complexity. We show that Catalyst applies to a large class of algorithms, including gradient descent, block coordinate descent, incremental algorithms such as SAG, SAGA, SDCA, SVRG, MISO/Finito, and their proximal variants. For all of these methods, we establish faster rates using the Catalyst acceleration, for strongly convex and non-strongly convex objectives.

@article{Lu2015,
	abstract = {In this paper we consider the composite self-concordant (CSC) minimization problem, which minimizes the sum of a self-concordant function f and a (possibly nonsmooth) proper closed convex function g. The CSC minimization is the cornerstone of the path-following interior point methods for solving a broad class of convex optimization problems. It has also found numerous applications in machine learning. The proximal damped Newton (PDN) methods have been well studied in the literature for solving this problem that enjoy a nice iteration complexity. Given that at each iteration these methods typically require evaluating or accessing the Hessian of f and also need to solve a proximal Newton subproblem, the cost per iteration can be prohibitively high when applied to large-scale problems. Inspired by the recent success of block coordinate descent methods, we propose a randomized block proximal damped Newton (RBPDN) method for solving the CSC minimization. Compared to the PDN methods, the computational cost per iteration of RBPDN is usually significantly lower. The computational experiment on a class of regularized logistic regression problems demonstrate that RBPDN is indeed promising in solving large-scale CSC minimization problems. The convergence of RBPDN is also analyzed in the paper. In particular, we show that RBPDN is globally convergent when g is Lipschitz continuous. It is also shown that RBPDN enjoys a local linear convergence. Moreover, we establish a global linear rate of convergence for a class of g including the case where g is smooth (but not necessarily self-concordant) and {$\nabla$}g is Lipschitz continuous in a certain level set of f + g. As a consequence, we obtain a global linear rate of convergence for the classical damped Newton methods [Y. Nesterov, Introductory Lectures on Convex Optimization: A Basic Course, Kluwer, Boston, 2004; Y. Zhang and L. Xiao, preprint, arXiv:1501.00263, 2015] and the PDN [Q. Tran-Dinh, A. Kyrillidis, and V. Cevher, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 16 (2015), pp. 371\textendash 416] for such g, which was previously unknown in the literature. Moreover, this result can be used to sharpen the existing iteration complexity of these methods.},

A new dynamical system, called Nesterov accelerated gradient flow, has been derived from the connection between acceleration mechanism and A-stability of ODE solvers, and the exponential decay of a tailored Lyapunov function along with the solution trajectory is proved. Numerical discretizations are then considered and convergence analyses are established via a unified discrete Lyapunov function. The proposed differential equation solver approach can not only cover existing accelerated methods, such as FISTA, Gu\textasciidieresis ler's new proximal algorithm and Nesterov's accelerated gradient method, but also produce new algorithms for solving composite convex optimization that possess accelerated convergence rates.},

	abstract = {The coordinate descent method enjoys a long history in convex differentiable minimization. Surprisingly, very little is known about the convergence of the iterates generated by this method. Convergence typically requires restrictive assumptions such as that the cost function has bounded level sets and is in some sense strictly convex. In a recent work, Luo and Tseng showed that the iterates are convergent for the symmetric monotone linear complementarity problem, for which the cost function is convex quadratic, but not necessarily strictly convex, and does not necessarily have bounded level sets. In this paper, we extend these results to problems for which the cost function is the composition of an affine mapping with a strictly convex function which is twice differentiable in its effective domain. In addition, we show that the convergence is at least linear. As a consequence of this result, we obtain, for the first time, that the dual iterates generated by a number of existing methods for matrix balancing and entropy optimization are linearly convergent.},

Besides other advantages, this useful feature provides the methods with a reliable stopping criterion. The proposed schemes differ from the classical approaches (divergent series methods, mirror descent methods) by presence of two control sequences. The first sequence is responsible for aggregating the support functions in the dual space, and the second one establishes a dynamically updated scale between the primal and dual spaces. This additional flexibility allows to guarantee a boundedness of the sequence of primal test points even in the case of unbounded feasible set (however, we always assume the uniform boundedness of subgradients). We present the variants of subgradient schemes for nonsmooth convex minimization, minimax problems, saddle point problems, variational inequalities, and stochastic optimization.

We show that for stochastic problems arising in machine learning such bound always holds; and we also propose an alternative convergence analysis of SGD with diminishing learning rate regime, which results in more relaxed conditions than those in Bottou et al. (2016). We then move on the asynchronous parallel setting, and prove convergence of Hogwild! algorithm in the same regime in the case of diminished learning rate. It is well-known that SGD converges if a sequence of learning rates \$\textbackslash\{\textbackslash eta\_t\textbackslash\}\$ satisfies \$\textbackslash sum\_\{t=0\}\^\textbackslash infty \textbackslash eta\_t \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty\$ and \$\textbackslash sum\_\{t=0\}\^\textbackslash infty \textbackslash eta\^2\_t {$<$} \textbackslash infty\$. We show the convergence of SGD for strongly convex objective function without using bounded gradient assumption when \$\textbackslash\{\textbackslash eta\_t\textbackslash\}\$ is a diminishing sequence and \$\textbackslash sum\_\{t=0\}\^\textbackslash infty \textbackslash eta\_t \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty\$. In other words, we extend the current state-of-the-art class of learning rates satisfying the convergence of SGD.},

	abstract = {In a real Hilbert space setting, we investigate the asymptotic properties of the solutions of a second-order differential system in view of linearly constrained convex minimization. The inertial dynamics are governed by a Hessian-driven damping term associated with the convex function to be minimized and potential effects induced by the linear constraints. We provide conditions on both the damping and the potential for which the solutions converge towards some feasible point of the convex minimization problem; this convergence is towards some minimizer provided that the solutions' initial data is specifically preselected. In addition, we present asymptotic estimates on the convergence rate of the solutions depending on the interaction between damping and potential effects. Our analysis is mainly based on energy-like arguments that capture the dissipative nature of the inertial dynamics by means of a Bregman distance. We complement our study with the fact that the second-order dynamics admit a first-order representation in terms of the Arrow--Hurwicz differential system. Numerical experiments further illustrate our theoretical findings.},

We first show that, unlike the unconstrained scenario, the vanilla projected gradient descent algorithm may converge to a strict saddle point even when there is only a single linear constraint. We then provide a hardness result by showing that checking ( g, H )-second order stationarity is NP-hard even in the presence of linear constraints. Despite our hardness result, we identify instances of the problem for which checking second order stationarity can be done efficiently. For such instances, we propose a dynamic second order Frank\textendash Wolfe algorithm which converges to ( g, H )-second order stationary points in O(max\{ g-2, -H3\}) iterations. The proposed algorithm can be used in general constrained non-convex optimization as long as the constrained quadratic subproblem can be solved efficiently.},

Three main algorithmic choices influence the performance of BCD methods: the block partitioning strategy, the block selection rule, and the block update rule. In this paper we explore all three of these building blocks and propose variations for each that can lead to significantly faster BCD methods. We (i) propose new greedy block-selection strategies that guarantee more progress per iteration than the Gauss-Southwell rule; (ii) explore practical issues like how to implement the new rules when using ``variable'' blocks; (iii) explore the use of message-passing to compute matrix or Newton updates efficiently on huge blocks for problems with a sparse dependency between variables; and (iv) consider optimal active manifold identification, which leads to bounds on the ``active-set complexity'' of BCD methods and leads to superlinear convergence for certain problems with sparse solutions (and in some cases finite termination at an optimal solution). We support all of our findings with numerical results for the classic machine learning problems of least squares, logistic regression, multi-class logistic regression, label propagation, and L1-regularization.},

The analysis of the technique relies on the observation that these schemes exhibit two modes of behavior depending on how much momentum is applied at each iteration. In what we refer to as the `high momentum' regime the iterates generated by an accelerated gradient scheme exhibit a periodic behavior, where the period is proportional to the square root of the local condition number of the objective function. Separately, it is known that the optimal restart interval is proportional to this same quantity. This suggests a restart technique whereby we reset the momentum whenever we observe periodic behavior. We provide a heuristic analysis that suggests that in many cases adaptively restarting allows us to recover the optimal rate of convergence with no prior knowledge of function parameters.},

In classification problems, a loss function is said to be proper if a minimizer of the expected loss is the true underlying probability. We show that for binary classification, the divergence associated with smooth, proper, and convex loss functions is upper bounded by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, to within a normalization constant. This implies that by minimizing the logarithmic loss associated with the KL divergence, we minimize an upper bound to any choice of loss from this set. As such the logarithmic loss is universal in the sense of providing performance guarantees with respect to a broad class of accuracy measures. Importantly, this notion of universality is not problem-specific, enabling its use in diverse applications, including predictive modeling, data clustering and sample complexity analysis. Generalizations to arbitary finite alphabets are also developed. The derived inequalities extend several well-known f -divergence results.},

Such models arise in many applications where, in addition to the composite nature of the objective function, a hierarchy of models is readily available. It is common to take advantage of this hierarchy of models by first solving a low fidelity model and then using the solution as a starting point to a high fidelity model. We adopt an optimization point of view and show how to take advantage of the availability of a hierarchy of models in a consistent manner. We do not use the low fidelity model just for the computation of promising starting points but also for the computation of search directions. We establish the convergence and convergence rate of the proposed algorithm. Our numerical experiments on large scale image restoration problems and the transition path problem suggest that, for certain classes of problems, the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than the state of the art.},

This is due to the fact that existing methods require to evaluate the proximity operator for the nonsmooth terms, which can be a costly operation for complex penalties. In this work we introduce two variance-reduced incremental methods based on SAGA and SVRG that can efficiently take into account complex penalties which can be expressed as a sum of proximal terms. This includes penalties such as total variation, group lasso with overlap and trend filtering, to name a few. Furthermore, we also develop sparse variants of the proposed algorithms which can take advantage of sparsity in the input data. Like other incremental methods, it only requires to evaluate the gradient of a single sample per iteration, and so is ideally suited for large scale applications. We provide a convergence rate analysis for the proposed methods and show that they converge with a fixed step-size, achieving in some cases the same asymptotic rate as their full gradient variants. Empirical benchmarks on 3 different datasets illustrate the practical advantages of the proposed methods.},

@article{rafatiQuasiNewtonOptimizationMethods2019,
	abstract = {Deep learning algorithms often require solving a highly non-linear and nonconvex unconstrained optimization problem. Methods for solving optimization problems in large-scale machine learning, such as deep learning and deep reinforcement learning (RL), are generally restricted to the class of first-order algorithms, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). While SGD iterates are inexpensive to compute, they have slow theoretical convergence rates. Furthermore, they require exhaustive trial-and-error to fine-tune many learning parameters. Using second-order curvature information to find search directions can help with more robust convergence for non-convex optimization problems. However, computing Hessian matrices for large-scale problems is not computationally practical. Alternatively, quasi-Newton methods construct an approximate of the Hessian matrix to build a quadratic model of the objective function. Quasi-Newton methods, like SGD, require only first-order gradient information, but they can result in superlinear convergence, which makes them attractive alternatives to SGD. The limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) approach is one of the most popular quasi-Newton methods that construct positive definite Hessian approximations. In this chapter, we propose efficient optimization methods based on L-BFGS quasi-Newton methods using line search and trust-region strategies. Our methods bridge the disparity between first- and second-order methods by using gradient information to calculate low-rank updates to Hessian approximations. We provide formal convergence analysis of these methods as well as empirical results on deep learning applications, such as image classification tasks and deep reinforcement learning on a set of ATARI 2600 video games. Our results show a robust convergence with preferred generalization characteristics as well as fast training time.},

For objective functions that decompose into a finitesum, we leverage ideas from variance reduction techniques for convex optimization to obtain new variance reduced nonconvex Frank-Wolfe methods that have provably faster convergence than the classical Frank-Wolfe method.

However, SGD's gradient descent is biased towards the random selection of a data instance. In this paper, it has been termed as data inconsistency. The proposed variation of SGD, Guided Stochastic Gradient Descent (GSGD) Algorithm, tries to overcome this inconsistency in a given dataset through greedy selection of consistent data instances for gradient descent. The empirical test results show the efficacy of the method. Moreover, GSGD has also been incorporated and tested with other popular variations of SGD, such as Adam, Adagrad and Momentum. The guided search with GSGD achieves better convergence and classification accuracy in a limited time budget than its original counterpart of canonical and other variation of SGD. Additionally, it maintains the same efficiency when experimented on medical benchmark datasets with logistic regression for classification.},

We also use the high-resolution ODE framework to study Nesterov's accelerated gradient method for (non-strongly) convex functions, uncovering a hitherto unknown result\textemdash that NAG-C minimizes the squared gradient norm at an inverse cubic rate.

@article{sunConvergent3BlockSemiProximal2015,
	abstract = {In this paper, we consider conic programming problems whose constraints consist of linear equalities, linear inequalities, a nonpolyhedral cone, and a polyhedral cone. A convenient way for solving this class of problems is to apply the directly extended alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to its dual problem, which has been observed to perform well in numerical computations but may diverge in theory. Ideally, one should find a convergent variant which is at least as efficient as the directly extended ADMM in practice. We achieve this goal by designing a convergent semiproximal ADMM (called sPADMM3c for convenience) for convex programming problems having three separable blocks in the objective function with the third part being linear. At each iteration, the proposed sPADMM3c takes one special block coordinate descent (BCD) cycle with the order 1 \textrightarrow{} 3 \textrightarrow{} 2 \textrightarrow{} 3, instead of the usual 1 \textrightarrow{} 2 \textrightarrow{} 3 Gauss\textendash Seidel BCD cycle used in the nonconvergent directly extended 3-block ADMM, for updating the variable blocks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the convergent method is at least 20\% faster than the directly extended ADMM with unit step-length for the vast majority of about 550 large-scale doubly nonnegative semidefinite programming problems with linear equality and/or inequality constraints. This confirms that at least for conic convex programming, one can design a convergent and efficient ADMM with a special BCD cycle of updating the variable blocks.},

The conic model method is a new type of method with more information available at each iteration than standard quadratic-based methods. Can we combine their advantages to form a more powerful method for constrained optimization? In this paper we give a positive answer and present a conic trust-region algorithm for non-linearly constrained optimization problems. The trust-region subproblem of our method is to minimize a conic function subject to the linearized constraints and the trust region bound. The use of conic functions allows the model to interpolate function values and gradient values of the Lagrange function at both the current point and previous iterate point. Since conic functions are the extension of quadratic functions, they approximate general nonlinear functions better than quadratic functions. At the same time, the new algorithm possesses robust global properties. In this paper we establish the global convergence of the new algorithm under standard conditions.},

However, their optimal convergence is attained only in terms of the weighted average of past iterative solutions. How to make the individual convergence of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimal, especially for strongly convex problems has now become a challenging problem in the machine learning community. On the other hand, Nesterov's recent weighted averaging strategy succeeds in achieving the optimal individual convergence of dual averaging (DA) but it fails in the basic mirror descent (MD). In this paper, a new primal averaging (PA) gradient operation step is presented, in which the gradient evaluation is imposed on the weighted average of all past iterative solutions. We prove that simply modifying the gradient operation step in MD by PA strategy suffices to recover the optimal individual rate for general convex problems. Along this line, the optimal individual rate of convergence for strongly convex problems can also be achieved by imposing the strong convexity on the gradient operation step. Furthermore, we extend PA-MD to solve regularized nonsmooth learning problems in the stochastic setting, which reveals that PA strategy is a simple yet effective extra step toward the optimal individual convergence of SGD. Several real experiments on sparse learning and SVM problems verify the correctness of our theoretical analysis.},

ADMM on the dual problem is also seen to be equivalent, in the special case of two sets, with one being a linear subspace.

These are the fastest known guaranteed linear convergence rates for globally convergent first-order methods, and for high desired accuracies the corresponding iteration complexity is within a factor of two of the theoretical lower bound. We use a simple graphical design procedure based on integral quadratic constraints to derive closed-form expressions for the algorithm parameters. The new algorithm, which we call the triple momentum method, can be seen as an extension of methods such as gradient descent, Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent, and the heavy-ball method.},

We propose and analyze a new proximal stochastic gradient method, which uses a multistage scheme to progressively reduce the variance of the stochastic gradient. While each iteration of this algorithm has similar cost as the classical stochastic gradient method (or incremental gradient method), we show that the expected objective value converges to the optimum at a geometric rate.

These issues are particularly acute in highly non-convex settings such as those arising in neural networks. Motivated by this, there has been recent interest in second-order methods that aim to alleviate these shortcomings by capturing curvature information. In this paper, we report detailed empirical evaluations of a class of Newton-type methods, namely sub-sampled variants of trust region (TR) and adaptive regularization with cubics (ARC) algorithms, for non-convex ML problems. In doing so, we demonstrate that these methods not only can be computationally competitive with hand-tuned SGD with momentum, obtaining comparable or better generalization performance, but also they are highly robust to hyper-parameter settings. Further, in contrast to SGD with momentum, we show that the manner in which these Newton-type methods employ curvature information allows them to seamlessly escape flat regions and saddle points.},

Other efficient stochastic second order methods have been also proposed. However, the convergence properties of these methods are still not well understood. There are also several important gaps between the current convergence theory and the empirical performance in real applications. In this paper, we aim to fill these gaps.

Normally it is easier to establish the global convergence of a trust region algorithm than that of its line search counterpart.

While the CR method is widely recognized as a globally convergent variant of Newton's method with superior iteration complexity, existing results on its local quadratic convergence require a stringent non-degeneracy condition. We prove that under a local error bound (EB) condition, which is much weaker a requirement than the existing non-degeneracy condition, the sequence of iterates generated by the CR method converges at least Q-quadratically to a second-order critical point. This indicates that adding a cubic regularization not only equips Newton's method with remarkable global convergence properties but also enables it to converge quadratically even in the presence of degenerate solutions. As a byproduct, we show that without assuming convexity, the proposed EB condition is equivalent to a quadratic growth condition, which could be of independent interest. To demonstrate the usefulness and relevance of our convergence analysis, we focus on two concrete nonconvex optimization problems that arise in phase retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery, respectively, and prove that with overwhelming probability, the sequence of iterates generated by the CR method for solving these two problems converges at least Q-quadratically to a global minimizer. We also present numerical results of the CR method when applied to solve these two problems to support and complement our theoretical development.},

It has been shown that the total Hessian sample complexity can be reduced to be sublinear in N per iteration by leveraging stochastic variance reduction techniques. We present an adaptive variance reduction scheme for subsampled Newton method with cubic regularization, and show that the expected Hessian sample complexity is O(N + N\^\{2/3\}\textbackslash epsilon\^\{-3/2\}) for finding an (\textbackslash epsilon,\textbackslash epsilon\^\{1/2\})-approximate local solution (in terms of first and second-order guarantees respectively). Moreover, we show that the same Hessian sample complexity retains with fixed sample sizes if exact gradients are used. The techniques of our analysis are different from previous works in that we do not rely on high probability bounds based on matrix concentration inequalities.

@book{Haddad2008,
	abstract = { Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Control presents and develops an extensive treatment of stability analysis and control design of nonlinear dynamical systems, with an emphasis on Lyapunov-based methods. Dynamical system theory lies at the heart of mathematical sciences and engineering. The application of dynamical systems has crossed interdisciplinary boundaries from chemistry to biochemistry to chemical kinetics, from medicine to biology to population genetics, from economics to sociology to psychology, and from physics to mechanics to engineering. The increasingly complex nature of engineering systems requiring feedback control to obtain a desired system behavior also gives rise to dynamical systems.  Wassim Haddad and VijaySekhar Chellaboina provide an exhaustive treatment of nonlinear systems theory and control using the highest standards of exposition and rigor. This graduate-level textbook goes well beyond standard treatments by developing Lyapunov stability theory, partial stability, boundedness, input-to-state stability, input-output stability, finite-time stability, semistability, stability of sets and periodic orbits, and stability theorems via vector Lyapunov functions. A complete and thorough treatment of dissipativity theory, absolute stability theory, stability of feedback systems, optimal control, disturbance rejection control, and robust control for nonlinear dynamical systems is also given. This book is an indispensable resource for applied mathematicians, dynamical systems theorists, control theorists, and engineers.},

    "abstract": "A class of monotone operator equations, which can be decomposed into sum of a gradient of a strongly convex function and a linear and skew-symmetric operator, is considered in this work. Based on discretization of the generalized gradient flow, gradient and skew-symmetric splitting (GSS) methods are proposed and proved to convergent in linear rate. To further accelerate the convergence, an accelerated gradient flow is proposed and accelerated gradient and skew-symmetric splitting (AGSS) methods are developed, which extends the acceleration among the existing works on the convex minimization to a more general class of monotone operator equations. In particular, when applied to smooth saddle point systems with bilinear coupling, an accelerated transformed primal-dual (ATPD) method is proposed and shown to achieve linear rates with optimal lower iteration complexity.",

In this section, we give more details about our experiment set up and highlight additional results. 

\smallsec{Experimental setup}
We use a greedy method to select uncorrelated concepts, using Pearson's correlation coefficient.  For each understandability setting, we compute the correlation coefficient between all pairs of concepts (using either the base rates or the learned concept vector). Next, we compute the 90\% percentile correlation coefficient and set that as a threshold. We add each concept to the list of chosen concepts if it is not more correlated than the threshold with any of the previously chosen concepts. 

When choosing the values of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, we fix $\lambda_1$ to 1, and pick $\lambda_2$ from $\{1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005\}$ that best explains the model on the validation set. 

\smallsec{Concepts for coarse grained scenes}
We first report the concepts chosen across the 6 faithfulness-understandability settings described in the main text. Similar to the fine-grained model, we see that the attributes chosen vary based on the setting (Tab.~\ref{tab:grouped_attr_comp}).

We report the 3 concepts with highest absolute weights within the explanation. Common concepts are \textbf{bolded}, \textit{\textcolor{red}{Red}} denotes that the coefficient is negative, whereas \textcolor{NavyBlue}{blue} denotes that the coefficient is positive. We note that the concepts highlighted are typically not shared among different explanations  }

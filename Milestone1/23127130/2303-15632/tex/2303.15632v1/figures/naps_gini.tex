    \caption{\textbf{Median normalized AP (top) and median gini impurity (bottom) of chosen concepts.} \textcolor{red}{To be updated:} We measure these two quantities for the 16 selected concepts chosen for different settings of faithfulness (sf, lf) and understandability (mu, su, lu). Both quantities generally increase as we increase understandability (i.e., the most understandable explanation selects concepts that are more learnable and correlated to specific scenes).
    % This makes sense as the most understandable explanation is most constrained and will select concepts that are more learnable and correlated to specific scenes.

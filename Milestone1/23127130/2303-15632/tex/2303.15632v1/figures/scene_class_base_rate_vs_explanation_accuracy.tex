    \caption{\textbf{Scene class base rate vs explanation accuracy}. We consider 3 explanations for the fine-grained scene model using the least faithful (lf) objective and all 3 understandability objectives: lf, mu (most understandable);  lf, su (somewhat understandable); and lf, lu (least understandable).
    % \emph{most understandable} () the least faithful, \emph{most understandable} (lf,mu) explanation, the least faithful, \emph{somewhat understandable} (lf, su) and the least faithful, \emph{least understandable} (lf,lu) explanation.
    We consider the explanation accuracy separately for each scene class and plot each class's base rate versus the difference between two explanations: lf,mu minus lf,lu (\emph{left}) and lf,su minus lf,lu (\emph{right}).  
    We note that while the lf,mu and lf,su explanations are overall less accurate, they are more accurate on the classes with higher base rates. 
    %We measure how increasing understandability of the explanation changes the true positive rate of different classes. Shown are the change in the true positive rate for different fine-grained scene classes for the lf seting. We see that increasing understandability increases the disparity between classes: Classes that have a higher base rate are better explained in the mu setting, whereas classes with lower base rates are better explained in the lu setting.

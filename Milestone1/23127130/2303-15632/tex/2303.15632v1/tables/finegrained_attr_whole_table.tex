\caption{\textbf{Selected concepts vary based on faithfulness-understandability setting.} 
We compare the concepts selected to explain the fine-grained scene model under the six faithfulness-understandability settings (\{\MU, \SU, \LU\} $\times$ \{\SF, \LF\}). We focus on a subset of randomly-selected scenes. For each, we highlight the top 3 concepts (i.e., highest absolute coefficients of $h_{pred}$). \textcolor{red}{\textit{Red}} denotes a concept with a negative coefficient, \textcolor{NavyBlue}{blue} denotes one with a positive coefficient, and \textbf{bold} emphasize a concept that is a top-3 concept for at least two of the six explanations for a given scene. We find that the concepts highlighted differ wildly across different definitions of faithfulness and understandability.
%; the rows sf and lf correspond to the somewhat faithful and least faithful explanations.  The top 3 concepts differ significantly across the six settings. For example, ``bathroom'' can be explained either by the presence of ``sink'' and absence of ``baby buggy'' (sf, mu) or by the presence of a ``cabinet'' and a ``door'' (lf, lu).  
%Concepts in \textcolor{red}{red} denote that the concept has a negative coefficient, whereas concepts in \textcolor{NavyBlue}{blue} have positive coefficients. 
% For example, the concepts with the highest coefficients for ``bathroom'' are either a lack of ``baby buggy'' and presence of ``sink'' or presence of a ``door'' and ``cabinet''.

  abstract = {A simple electrostatic method for the calculation of optical transition energies of pigments in protein environments is presented and applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex of Prosthecochloris aestuarii and Chlorobium tepidum. The method, for the first time, allows us to reach agreement between experimental optical spectra and calculations based on transition energies of pigments that are calculated in large part independently, rather than fitted to the spectra. In this way it becomes possible to understand the molecular mechanism allowing the protein to trigger excitation energy transfer reactions. The relative shift in excitation energies of the seven bacteriochlorophyll-a pigments of the FMO complex of P. aestuarii and C. tepidum are obtained from calculations of electrochromic shifts due to charged amino acids, assuming a standard protonation pattern of the protein, and by taking into account the three different ligand types of the pigments. The calculations provide an explanation of some of the earlier results for the transition energies obtained from fits of optical spectra. In addition, those earlier fits are verified here by using a more advanced theory of optical spectra, a genetic algorithm, and excitonic couplings obtained from electrostatic calculations that take into account the influence of the dielectric protein environment. The two independent calculations of site energies strongly favor one of the two possible orientations of the FMO trimer relative to the photosynthetic membrane, which were identified by electron microscopic studies and linear dichroism experiments. Efficient transfer of excitation energy to the reaction center requires bacteriochlorophylls 3 and 4 to be the linker pigments. The temporal and spatial transfer of excitation energy through the FMO complex is calculated to proceed along two branches, with transfer times that differ by an order of magnitude.},

This procedure circumvents the calculation of a spectral density via Fourier inversion of the correlation function. When the correlation function is available with high precision, we find that the direct procedure yields results just as accurate as those obtained using the spectral density expressions. However, when statistical noise is present, the direct procedure produces more accurate results. The direct procedure is efficient and easy to implement.},

Our model provides unambiguous interpretation of previous photoelectron studies, reproducing the binding energies and photoelectron images for bare uracil and a single isomer of the U\textbullet (H2O)1 cluster.

Superposition of de Broglie matter waves has been observed for massive particles such as electrons, atoms and dimers, small van der Waals clusters, and neutrons. But matter wave interferometry with larger objects has remained experimentally challenging, despite the development of powerful atom interferometric techniques for experiments in fundamental quantum mechanics, metrology and lithography. Here we report the observation of de Broglie wave interference of C60 molecules by diffraction at a material absorption grating. This molecule is the most massive and complex object in which wave behaviour has been observed. Of particular interest is the fact that C60 is almost a classical body, because of its many excited internal degrees of freedom and their possible couplings to the environment. Such couplings are essential for the appearance of decoherence, suggesting that interference experiments with large molecules should facilitate detailed studies of this process.},

By exploiting the connection between configuration interaction and CC through cluster analysis, the higher-order T3 and T4 terms obtained from ACI are used to augment the T1 and T2 amplitude equations from traditional CC. These higher-order contributions are kept frozen during the CC iterations and do not contribute to an increased cost with respect to coupled cluster including the single and double excitations (CCSD). We have benchmarked this method on three closed-shell systems: beryllium dimer, carbonyl oxide, and cyclobutadiene, with good results compared to other corrected CC methods. In all cases, the inclusion of these external corrections improved upon the ``gold standard'' CCSD(T) results, indicating that ACI-CCSD(T) can be used to assess strong correlation effects in a system and as an inexpensive starting point for more complex external corrections.},

  abstract = {Approximating molecular wave functions involves heavy numerical effort; therefore, codes for such tasks are written completely or partially in efficient languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. While these tools are dominant throughout quantum chemistry packages, the efficient development of new methods is often hindered by the complexity associated with code development. In order to ameliorate this scenario, some software packages take a dual approach where a simpler, higher-level language, such as Python, substitutes the traditional ones wherever performance is not critical. Julia is a novel, dynamically typed, programming language that aims to solve this two-language problem. It gained attention because of its modern and intuitive design, while still being highly optimized to compete with ``low-level'' languages. Recently, some chemistry-related projects have emerged exploring the capabilities of Julia. Herein, we introduce the quantum chemistry package Fermi.jl, which contains the first implementations of pos},

  abstract = {Quantum simulators promise to offer new insights into strongly correlated matter beyond what is accessible by means of classical computers. We propose dynamical quantum simulators (DQSs) as a method to simulate dynamical structure factors (DSFs) for system sizes considerably larger than what classical simulations can compute and provide complexity-theoretic evidence that they cannot be classically efficiently computed. Based on state-of-the-art experimental setups, we show how results from DQSs can be directly compared to experiments exploring properties of quantum materials. At the same time, we explore long-ranged spin systems: In particular, we show that the DSFs in DQSs can exhibit the signatures of excitation confinement in long-ranged models for which a comprehensive understanding is lacking.The dynamical structure factor is one of the experimental quantities crucial in scrutinizing the validity of the microscopic description of strongly correlated systems. However, despite its long-standing importance, it is exceedingly difficult in generic cases to numerically calculate it, ensuring that the necessary approximations involved yield a correct result. Acknowledging this practical difficulty, we discuss in what way results on the hardness of classically tracking time evolution under local Hamiltonians are precisely inherited by dynamical structure factors and, hence, offer in the same way the potential computational capabilities that dynamical quantum simulators do: We argue that practically accessible variants of the dynamical structure factors are bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP)-hard for general local Hamiltonians. Complementing these conceptual insights, we improve upon a novel, readily available measurement setup allowing for the determination of the dynamical structure factor in different architectures, including arrays of ultra-cold atoms, trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting qubits. Our results suggest that quantum simulations employing near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices should allow for the observation of features of dynamical structure factors of correlated quantum matter in the presence of experimental imperfections, for larger system sizes than what is achievable by classical simulation.All study data are included in the article and supporting information.},

Particular care has been devoted to generality, modularity, and numerical stability including all the contributions that play a role at the harmonic level of approximation, namely Franck\textendash Condon, Herzberg\textendash Teller, and Dushinsky (i.e., mode mixing) effects. The implementation shares the same general framework of our previous time-independent (TI) model, thus allowing an effective integration between both approaches with the consequent enhancement of their respective strengths (e.g., spectrum completeness and straightforward account of temperature effects for the TD route versus band resolution and assignment for the TI route) using a single set of starting data. Implementation of both models in the same general computer program allows comprehensive studies using several levels of electronic structure description together with effective account of environmental effects by atomistic and/or continuum models of different sophistication. A few medium-size molecules (furan, phenyl radical, anthracene, dimethyloxirane, coumarin 339) have been studied in order to fully validate the approach.},

The main idea is to identify a trajectory-specific reference Hamiltonian that captures the dominant effects of the classical ``solvent'' degrees of freedom on the dynamics of the quantum ``system''. This time-dependent reference is used to construct a system propagator that is valid for large time increments. Residual ``quantum memory'' interactions are included via the path integral representation of the density matrix, which converges with large time steps. Two physically motivated reference schemes are considered. The first involves the dynamics of the solvent unperturbed by the system, which forms the basis for the ``classical path'' approximation. The second is based on solvent trajectories determined self-consistently with the evolution of the system, according to the time-dependent self-consistent field or Ehrenfest model. Application to dissipative two-level systems indicates that both reference schemes allow a substantial increase of the path integral time step, leading to rapid convergence of the path sum. In addition, the time-dependent reference propagators automatically weigh state-to-state coupling against solvent reorganization in the determination of transition probabilities, further enhancing the convergence of the path integral.},

First, we argue that the dynamics in the link can be described using an inhomogeneous Heisenberg spin chain whose couplings are defined by the local temperature. Second, we show the existence of a spin current in a system with a temperature difference by studying the dynamics that follows the spin-flip of an atom in the link. A temperature gradient accelerates the impurity in one direction more than in the other, leading to an overall spin current similar to the spin Seebeck effect.},

On the contrary, ab initio theorists insist on the ability to converge to the right answer in appropriate limits, but this requires a treatment of the reduced two-particle density matrix. DFT avoids that by appealing to an ``existence'' theorem (not a constructive one) that all its effects are subsummed into a DFT functional of the one-particle density. However, the existence of thousands of DFT functionals emphasizes that there is no satisfactory way to systematically improve the Kohn-Sham (KS) version as most changes in parameterization or formulation seldom lead to a new functional that is genuinely better than others. Some researchers in the DFT community try to address this issue by imposing conditions rigorously derived from exact DFT considerations, but to date, no one has shown how this route will ever lead to converged results even for the ground state, much less for all the other electronic states obtained from time-dependent DFT that are critically important for chemistry. On the contrary, coupled-cluster (CC) theory and its equation-of-motion extensions provide rigorous results for both that KS-DFT methods are attempting to emulate. How to use them and their exact formal properties to tie CC theory to an effective one-particle form is the target of this perspective. This route addresses the devil's triangle of KS-DFT problems: the one-particle spectrum, self-interaction, and the integer discontinuity.},

  abstract = {The techniques of quantum field theory are used to investigate the thermodynamic ion displacement correlation function\textemdash or Green's function of the phonon field\textemdash in a crystal and especially in a metal. The structure of thermodynamic Green's functions is outlined and the method for solving for them at finite temperature is fully discussed. The analytic structure of the phonon Green's function is then considered. This function is shown to be bounded and invertible everywhere off the real axis; a spectral form is derived for its inverse. The symmetries imposed by the point group of the crystal are then discussed. Assuming small ionic oscillations, we find the inverse of the phonon Green's function as a linear function of the electronic contribution to the dielectric response function of the metal. This dielectric function is shown to be simply related to the longitudinal part of the conductivity tensor that gives the response of the electrons to the effective electric field in the metal. The assumption of translational invariance then leads to an explicit expression for the phonon Green's function in terms of this conductivity. The deformations in the lattice induced by an arbitrarily time varying external force are calculated in terms of the retarded phonon Green's function. In the static long wavelength limit the phonon Green's function yields the macroscopic elastic constants of the crystal. Their relation to the conductivity is exhibited, and several elastic constants are estimated. We also see that the complete phonon spectrum and the lifetimes of the phonon states may be calculated from this Green's function. A relation between the long wavelength acoustic attenuation in metals and the de conductivity is derived, which is in good agreement with recent experiments. Furthermore, the ions in a metal are shown to have a high-frequency oscillation along with the electrons, at essentially the electron plasma frequency.},

  abstract = {A review is given on the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets. The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications, MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many (typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24 (!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction. These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator and many model potential functions already have this required structure. For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation (CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed.},

To include vibronic spectral features not captured in the global harmonic models, we have recently implemented an on-the-fly ab initio extended thawed Gaussian approximation, where the propagated wavepacket is a Gaussian multiplied by a linear polynomial. To include more anharmonic effects, here we represent the initial wavepacket by a superposition of three independent Gaussian wavepackets\textemdash one for the Condon term and two displaced Gaussians for the Herzberg\textendash Teller part. Application of this ab initio ``three thawed Gaussians approximation''to vibrationally resolved electronic spectra of the phenyl radical and benzene shows a clear improvement over the global harmonic and Condon approximations. The orientational averaging of spectra, the relation between the gradient of the transition dipole moment and nonadiabatic coupling vectors, and the details of the extended and three thawed Gaussians approximation are discussed.},

In most calculations, these effects, for instance, zero-point energies, are simply neglected or only taken into account within the quantum harmonic oscillator approximation. Herein, we present a new method, Generalized Smoothed Trajectory Analysis, to determine nuclear quantum effects from molecular dynamics simulations. The broad applicability is demonstrated with the examples of a harmonic oscillator and different states of water. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for ideal gas up to the temperature of 5000 K. Classical molecular dynamics have been carried out for hexagonal ice, liquid water, and vapor at atmospheric pressure. With respect to the experimental heat capacity, our method outperforms previous calculations in the literature in a wide temperature range at lower computational cost than other alternatives. Dynamic and structural nuclear quantum effects of water are also discussed.},

Many physically relevant models in one dimension are Bethe-ansatz integrable, including the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg (also called the spin-1/2 XXZ chain) and the Fermi-Hubbard model. Nevertheless, practical computations of correlation functions and transport coefficients pose hard problems from both the conceptual and technical points of view. Only because of recent progress in the theory of integrable systems, on the one hand, and the development of numerical methods, on the other hand, has it become possible to compute their finite-temperature and nonequilibrium transport properties quantitatively. Owing to the discovery of a novel class of quasilocal conserved quantities, there is now a qualitative understanding of the origin of ballistic finite-temperature transport, and even diffusive or superdiffusive subleading corrections, in integrable lattice models. The current understanding of transport in one-dimensional lattice models, in particular, in the paradigmatic example of the spin-1/2 XXZ and Fermi-Hubbard models, is reviewed, as well as state-of-the-art theoretical methods, including both analytical and computational approaches. Among other novel techniques, matrix-product-state-based simulation methods, dynamical typicality, and, in particular, generalized hydrodynamics are covered. The close and fruitful connection between theoretical models and recent experiments is discussed, with examples given from the realms of both quantum magnets and ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices.},

The first step of the singlet fission (SF) is initiated by the capture of sunlight by chromophores in the visible region, which is the prime factor for subsequent transfer of the excited energies to the neighboring chromophores. The key electronic properties of organic chromophores for SF are dictated by the interplay of the electronic states involved in this process. The separation of two triplet excitons from the correlated triplet pair strongly depends on the molecular structure and their packing motif though either a covalent or noncovalent packing orientation that controls the efficiency of SF. In this Feature Article, we discuss the SF mechanism considering the thermodynamic condition, its correlation to the molecular structure, and, finally, its effects on the triplet yield generation from the first-principles computation. The discussion ranges from the single molecule to a dimeric pair of crystalline states in the context of technological importance and design principle rules for SF. Finally, we end this Feature Article with a brief overview of the experimental findings of our proposed chromophores in terms of the applicability in SF.},

Bienfait et al. describe the deterministic emission and capture of itinerant phonons through an acoustic communication channel, enabling the phonon-based coherent transfer of quantum states from one superconducting qubit to another and the quantum entanglement of the two qubits over the acoustic channel. The results provide a route to couple hybrid quantum solid-state systems using surface acoustic waves.

Phonons, and in particular surface acoustic wave phonons, have been proposed as a means to coherently couple distant solid-state quantum systems. Individual phonons in a resonant structure can be controlled and detected by superconducting qubits, enabling the coherent generation and measurement of complex stationary phonon states. We report the deterministic emission and capture of itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons, enabling the quantum entanglement of two superconducting qubits. Using a 2-millimeter-long acoustic quantum communication channel, equivalent to a 500-nanosecond delay line, we demonstrate the emission and recapture of a phonon by one superconducting qubit, quantum state transfer between two superconducting qubits with a 67\% efficiency, and, by partial transfer of a phonon, generation of an entangled Bell pair with a fidelity of 84\%.},

Following the observation of long-lived beats in 2D electronic spectroscopy of PC645, vibronic coherence, the delocalization of excited states between pigments supported by a resonant vibration, has been proposed to enable direct excitation transport from the highest-energy to the lowest-energy pigments, bypassing a collection of intermediate states. Here, we instead show that for phycobiliprotein PC645 an incoherent vibronic transport mechanism is at play. We quantify the solvation dynamics of individual pigments using ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) nuclear dynamics. Our atomistic spectral densities reproduce experimental observations ranging from absorption and fluorescence spectra to the timescales and selectivity of down-conversion observed in transient absorption measurements. We construct a general model for vibronic dimers and establish the parameter regimes of coherent and incoherent vibronic transport. We demonstrate that direct down-conversion in PC645 proceeds incoherently, enhanced by large reorganization energies and a broad collection of high-frequency vibrations. We suggest that a similar incoherent mechanism is appropriate across phycobiliproteins and represents a potential design principle for nanoscale control of EET.},

Path integral Monte Carlo methods offer a numerically exact approach for obtaining the Boltzmann density in coordinate space, but the Fourier-type integral required to construct the Wigner distribution generally leads to poor convergence. This paper describes a path integral method for constructing the Wigner density which substantially mitigates the Monte Carlo sign problem and thus is applicable to systems with many degrees of freedom. The starting point is the path integral representation of the coherent state density, which does not involve a Fourier integral and thus converges rapidly. We then use the relation between the coherent state and Wigner densities to construct the Wigner function, taking advantage of destructive phase cancellation to truncate the infinite series and thus confine the integrand, avoiding highly oscillatory regions. We also describe the use of information-guided noise reduction (IGNoR) to improve the Monte Carlo statistics in the most challenging regimes. The method is applied to strongly anharmonic one-dimensional models, a system-bath Hamiltonian, as well as the formamide molecule within an ab initio quartic potential, and the results are compared to those obtained by various approximate methods. These calculations suggest that the coherent state-based path integral method described in this paper offers an efficient, numerically exact approach for constructing the Wigner phase space density in systems of many degrees of freedom, and thus will be useful for quantizing the initial condition in classical trajectory-based simulations of dynamical properties.},

  abstract = {We present an approach of analyzing the transport of a quantum particle in a non-trivially connected extended system interacting with a dissipative medium. There are broadly two different aspects of the problem that affect the route taken by the transport process. First is obviously the couplings between the various sites, which translates into the intrinsic "strength" of a channel. Apart from the inter-site couplings, the solvents affecting the energies of the sites, and their relative coupling strengths and time-scales form the second factor. This impact of the such dissipative media is significantly more difficult to analyze. The Channel-Dependent Population Transfer (CDPT) method of analyzing the transport allows us to account for both the effects in a rigorous manner. We demonstrate the richness hidden behind the transport even for relatively simple systems -- the effect of the local dissipative media is highly non-trivial and can mask the simplicity of the effect of the relative magnitude of the inter-site couplings. This opens up possibilities in terms of detailed study of the impact of factors on the nature of dynamics, especially possibilities of design of novel systems with an eye towards quantum control.},

  abstract = {Tensor network decompositions of path integrals for simulating open quantum systems have recently been proven to be useful. However, these methods scale exponentially with the system size. This makes it challenging to simulate the non-equilibrium dynamics of extended quantum systems coupled with local dissipative environments. In this work, we extend the tensor network path integral (TNPI) framework to efficiently simulate such extended systems. The Feynman\textendash Vernon influence functional is a popular approach used to account for the effect of environments on the dynamics of the system. In order to facilitate the incorporation of the influence functional into a multisite framework (MS-TNPI), we combine a matrix product state (MPS) decomposition of the reduced density tensor of the system along the sites with a corresponding tensor network representation of the time axis to construct an efficient 2D tensor network. The 2D MS-TNPI network, when contracted, yields the time-dependent reduced density tensor of the extended system as an MPS. The algorithm presented is independent of the system Hamiltonian. We outline an iteration scheme to take the simulation beyond the non-Markovian memory introduced by solvents. Applications to spin chains coupled to local harmonic baths are presented; we consider the Ising, XXZ, and Heisenberg models, demonstrating that the presence of local environments can often dissipate the entanglement between the sites. We discuss three factors causing the system to transition from a coherent oscillatory dynamics to a fully incoherent dynamics. The MS-TNPI method is useful for studying a variety of extended quantum systems coupled with solvents.},

When the reactants are described by a single quantum state, as in the case of electron transfer reactions, the factorized reactant density describes the true initial condition of the reactive process. In such cases, the time integral of the non-equilibrium flux expression yields the reactant population as a function of time, allowing characterization of the dynamics in cases where there is no clear separation of time scales and thus a plateau regime cannot be identified. The non-equilibrium flux offers a unified approach to the kinetics of slow and fast chemical reactions and is ideally suited to mixed quantum-classical methods.},

This pairwise connected TNPI (PC-TNPI) is illustrated through applications to typical spin-boson problems and explorations of the differences caused by the exact form of the spectral density. The storage and performance scalings are reported, showing the compactness of the representation and the efficiency of the contraction process.

  abstract = {Exact quantum dynamical simulation of processes in highly coupled condensed phase reactions is extremely challenging. The work reported in this dissertation builds on top of two different approaches. First, we present methods for calculating the multidimensional Wigner function. We start with a simple and approximate method which utilizes classical trajectories. This fits well with the subsequent classical propagation involved in a quasiclassical simulation. We use this method to study molecular Hamiltonians in both normal mode and Cartesian coordinates. Despite the simplicity of this method, there can be systems which are extremely anharmonic, where the method can be extremely slow to converge when there is no obviously good starting point. To overcome this problem, we propose a numerically exact path integral based method which can be systematically converged to any desired level of accuracy at increasing computational cost. Both these methods can be used with quantum classical simulation frameworks. Second, we present developments of rate theory methods. We extend the existing reactive flux rate methods to exact quantum classical methods. Two different initial conditions are proposed. If the transients are important, we show that the so-called ``non-equilibrium'' initial condition can help us unify the fast timescales as well as the long timescale dynamics governed by the rate. On the other hand, if the transients are of less importance, we propose a ``near equilibrium'' initial condition that can very effectively get rid of most of the transients. This initial condition captures the system-solvent interaction without increasing the complexity of the algorithm. Finally, we present a method of incorporating the concept of blip summation into the quantum-classical path integral (QCPI) method. This gives additional speedup on top of all the other advancements that make QCPI a very attractive method for doing exact quantum dynamics in condensed phase.},

In a recent paper, we introduced a non-equilibrium formulation which eliminates the need for construction of this distribution and which gives the reaction rate along with the time evolution of the reactant population. In this work, we describe a near-equilibrium formulation of the reactive flux, which accounts for important thermal correlations between the quantum system and its environment while avoiding the numerical instabilities of the full Weyl\textendash Wigner transform. By minimizing early-time transients, the near-equilibrium formulation leads to an earlier onset of the plateau regime, allowing determination of the reaction rate from short-time dynamics. In combination with the quantum-classical path integral methodology, the near-equilibrium formulation offers an accurate and efficient approach for determining reaction rate constants in condensed phase environments. The near-equilibrium formulation may also be combined with a variety of approximate quantum-classical propagation methods.},

  abstract = {Hyperuniform states of matter are characterized by anomalous suppression of long-wavelength density fluctuations. While most of the interesting cases of disordered hyperuniformity are provided by complex many-body systems such as liquids or amorphous solids, classical spin chains with certain long-range interactions have been shown to demonstrate the same phenomenon. Such spin-chain systems are ideal models for exploring the effects of quantum mechanics on hyperuniformity. It is well-known that the transverse field Ising model shows a quantum phase transition (QPT) at zero temperature. Under the quantum effects of a transverse magnetic field, classical hyperuniform spin chains are expected to lose their hyperuniformity. High-precision simulations of these cases are complicated because of the presence of highly nontrivial long-range interactions. We perform an extensive analysis of these systems using density matrix renormalization group simulations to study the possibilities of phase transitions and the mechanism by which they lose hyperuniformity. Even for a spin chain of length 30, we see discontinuous changes in properties like the ``{$\tau$} order metric'' of the ground state, the measure of hyperuniformity, and the second cumulant of the total magnetization along the x-direction, all suggestive of first-order QPTs. An interesting feature of the phase transitions in these disordered hyperuniform spin chains is that, depending on the parameter values, the presence of a transverse magnetic field may lead remarkably to an increase in the order of the ground state as measured by the ``{$\tau$} order metric,'' even if hyperuniformity is lost. Therefore, it would be possible to design materials to target specific novel quantum behaviors in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. Our numerical investigations suggest that these spin chains can show no more than two QPTs. We further analyze the long-range interacting spin chains via the Jordan-Wigner mapping onto a system of spinless fermions, showing that under the pairwise-interaction approximation and a mean-field treatment, there can be at most two quantum phase transitions. Based on these numerical and theoretical explorations, we conjecture that for spin chains with long-range pair interactions that have convergent cosine transforms, there can be a maximum of two quantum phase transitions at zero temperature.},

The numerical construction of the latter and its use as a sampling function can be challenging. We show that the operator dependence of the phase space distribution can be transferred to the dynamics, allowing sampling from the simpler Wigner phase space density. The method involves augmenting the classical equations of motion with additional differential equations for elements of the stability matrix. We also propose a local harmonic approximation for the dynamical derivatives, which significantly reduces the computational cost required to obtain correlation functions of nonlinear operators. We illustrate the method with application to linear and nonlinear correlation functions of model Hamiltonians. While the local harmonic approximation is not always successful in predicting nonlinear correlation functions of one degree of freedom, it quantitatively captures the full quasiclassical results for systems in contact with dissipative environments.},

A novel tensor network-based decomposition of real-time path integral simulations involving Feynman-Vernon influence functional is introduced. In this tensor network path integral (TNPI) technique, the finitetemporarily non-local interactions introduced by the influence functional can be captured very effi-ciently using matrix product state representation for the path-dependent Green's function (PDGF). We illustrate this particular TNPI method through various realistic examples, including a chargetransfer reaction and an exciton transfer in a dimer. We also show how it is readily applied to systems with greater than two states. PDGF-TNPI utilizes the symmetries of the problem, leading to accelerated convergence and dramatic reductions of computational effort. We also introduce anapproximate method that speeds up propagation beyond the non-local memory length. Further-more, the structure imposed by the tensor network representation of the PDGF naturally suggests other factorizations that make simulations for extended systems more efficient. These factorizations would be the subject of future explorations. The flexibility of the PDGF-TNPI framework makesit a promising new addition to the family of path integral methods for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.},

In this paper we discuss the implementation of the ASW procedure to polyatomic molecules both in normal mode coordinates and in Cartesian coordinates. We present its application to a six-degree-of-freedom model based on an ab initio quartic potential energy surface developed for formaldehyde in the normal mode representation and for butyne in Cartesian coordinates using the CHARMM force field. Comparisons of equilibrium properties against accurate quantum mechanical results indicate that the ASW is reliable and highly accurate over a wide temperature range in both the coordinate systems. Further, the ASW density is invariant under classical evolution, thus it is ideally suited to quasiclassical trajectory simulations. We also describe a very simple ASW-based procedure for obtaining complex-valued quasiclassical time correlation functions and vibrational spectra.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of the Wigner phase space density for systems of many degrees of freedom presents an extremely demanding task because of the oscillatory nature of the Fourier-type integral. We propose a simple and efficient, approximate procedure for generating the Wigner distribution that avoids the computational difficulties associated with the Wigner transform. Starting from a suitable zeroth-order Hamiltonian, for which the Wigner density is available (either analytically or numerically), the phase space distribution is propagated in time via classical trajectories, while the perturbation is gradually switched on. According to the classical adiabatic theorem, each trajectory maintains a constant action if the perturbation is switched on infinitely slowly. We show that the adiabatic switching procedure produces the exact Wigner density for harmonic oscillator eigenstates and also for eigenstates of anharmonic Hamiltonians within the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. We generalize the approach to finite temperature by introducing a density rescaling factor that depends on the energy of each trajectory. Time-dependent properties are obtained simply by continuing the integration of each trajectory under the full target Hamiltonian. Further, by construction, the generated approximate Wigner distribution is invariant under classical propagation, and thus, thermodynamic properties are strictly preserved. Numerical tests on one-dimensional and dissipative systems indicate that the method produces results in very good agreement with those obtained by full quantum mechanical methods over a wide temperature range. The method is simple and efficient, as it requires no input besides the force fields required for classical trajectory integration, and is ideal for use in quasiclassical trajectory calculations.},

However, the accuracy of this procedure depends on the validity of the high temperature approximation. In this work, an alternative derivation based on the Kubo formalism is provided. This enables the calculation of additional correction terms that increases the range of applicability of the procedure to lower temperatures. Because it is based on the Kubo-transformed correlation function, this approach allows the direct use of correlation functions obtained from methods such as ring-polymer molecular dynamics and centroid molecular dynamics in determining the influence functional coefficients for subsequent system-solvent simulations. The accuracy of the original procedure and the corrected procedure is investigated across a range of parameters. It is interesting that the correction term comes at zero additional cost. Furthermore, it is possible to improve upon the correction using zero-cost physical intuition and heuristics making the method even more accurate.},

We use the Bloch\textendash Redfield (BR) formalism, valid in the very weak system\textendash bath coupling limit, the noninteracting-blip approximation (NIBA), applicable in the nonadiabatic limit, and iterative, numerically exact path integral tools. These methodologies were originally developed for the description of the dissipative dynamics of a quantum system, and here they are applied to explore the problem of quantum energy transport in a nonequilibrium setting. Specifically, we study the weak-to-intermediate system\textendash bath coupling regime at high temperatures kBT/{$\hslash$} \textbackslash textgreater {$\epsilon$}, with {$\epsilon$} as the characteristic frequency of the two-state system. The BR formalism and NIBA can lead to close results for the dynamics of the reduced density matrix (RDM) in a certain range of parameters. However, relatively small deviations in the RDM dynamics propagate into significant qualitative discrepancies in the transport behavior. Similarly, beyond the strict nonadiabatic limit NIBA's prediction for the heat current is qualitatively incorrect: It fails to capture the turnover behavior of the current with tunneling energy and temperature. Thus, techniques that proved meaningful for describing the RDM dynamics, to some extent even beyond their rigorous range of validity, should be used with great caution in heat transfer calculations, because qualitative-serious failures develop once parameters are mildly stretched beyond the techniques' working assumptions.},

Thermal expansion, magnetostriction, specific heat, magnetization, and magnetocaloric measurements are found to be in excellent agreement with exact Bethe-Ansatz predictions. Close to the critical field, thermodynamics obeys the expected quantum critical scaling behavior, and in particular, the magnetocaloric effect and the Gr\"uneisen parameters diverge in a characteristic manner.

To resolve the longstanding puzzle, we apply the flux balance method to predict the functional form of the substrate dependence in the mean turnover time of complex enzymatic reactions and identify detailed balance (i.e., the lack of unbalanced conformtional current) as a sufficient condition for the Michaelis-Menten equation to describe the substrate concentration dependence of the turnover rate in an enzymatic network. This prediction can be verified in single-molecule event-averaged measurements using the recently proposed signatures of detailed balance violations. The finding helps analyze recent single-molecule studies of enzymatic networks and can be applied to other external variables, such as force-dependence and voltage-dependence.},

  abstract = {We revise the interpretation of coherence signals in photosynthetic systems and clarify what they tell us about light harvesting. Photosynthesis is a highly optimized process from which valuable lessons can be learned about the operating principles in nature. Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.},

Although many approximation methods have been introduced, the complexity of quantum mechanics remains hard to appease. The advent of quantum computation brings new pathways to navigate this challenging and complex landscape. By manipulating quantum states of matter and taking advantage of their unique features such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to efficiently deliver accurate results for many important problems in quantum chemistry, such as the electronic structure of molecules. In the past two decades, significant advances have been made in developing algorithms and physical hardware for quantum computing, heralding a revolution in simulation of quantum systems. This Review provides an overview of the algorithms and results that are relevant for quantum chemistry. The intended audience is both quantum chemists who seek to learn more about quantum computing and quantum computing researchers who would like to explore applications in quantum chemistry.},

Also closed quanto-mechanical systems may stop wandering freely around the whole Hilbert space, even if they are initially prepared into a macroscopically large combination of eigenstates. Here, we report numerical evidences that the dynamics of strongly interacting lattice bosons driven sufficiently far from equilibrium can be trapped into extremely long-lived inhomogeneous metastable states. The slowing down of incoherent density excitations above a threshold energy, much reminiscent of a dynamical arrest on the verge of a glass transition, is identified as the key feature of this phenomenon. We argue that the resulting long-lived inhomogeneities are responsible for the lack of thermalization observed in large systems. Such a rich phenomenology could be experimentally uncovered upon probing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of conveniently prepared quantum states of trapped cold atoms which we hereby suggest.},

In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in QML after training on a limited number N of training data points. We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with T trainable gates scales at worst as \$\$\textbackslash sqrt\{T/N\}\$\$. When only K\,{$\ll$}\,T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to \$\$\textbackslash sqrt\{K/N\}\$\$. Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML, as good generalization is guaranteed from few training data.},

The evolution of these systems over specific time scales encodes the action of the unitary transformation. We identify bounds on the complexity of the transformations that can be represented by these circuits and on the optoelectronic properties of the dye molecules that comprise them. We formalize this strategy and apply it to determine the excitonic circuits of the four universal quantum logic gates: NOT, Hadamard, {$\pi$}/8 and CNOT. We discuss the properties of these circuits and how their performance is expected to be influenced by the presence of environmental noise.},

While it is best suited to first principles calculations and path integral molecular dynamics, i-PI can also be used to perform classical molecular dynamics simulations, and can just as easily be interfaced with an empirical forcefield code.

The good agreement between the optical spectra calculated for the inhomogeneous ensemble and the experimental data demonstrates that electrostatics is the dominant contributor to static disorder in site energies. Rotamers of polar amino acid side chains are found to cause bimodal distribution functions of site energy shifts, which can be probed by hole burning and single-molecule spectroscopy. When summing over the large number of contributions, the resulting distribution functions of the site energies become Gaussians, and the correlations in site energy fluctuations at different sites practically average to zero. These results demonstrate that static disorder in the FMO protein is in the realm of the central limit theorem of statistics.},

In this complex, excitation energy transfer occurs between the bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) pigments. Two quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) studies, each with a different force-field and quantum chemistry approach, reported different excitation energy distributions for the FMO complex. To understand the reasons for these differences in the predicted excitation energies, we have carried out a comparative study between the simulations using the CHARMM and AMBER force field and the Zerner intermediate neglect of differential orbital (ZINDO)/S and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) quantum chemistry methods. The calculations using the CHARMM force field together with ZINDO/S or TDDFT always show a wider spread in the energy distribution compared to those using the AMBER force field. High- or low-energy tails in these energy distributions result in larger values for the spectral density at low frequencies. A detailed study on individual BChl a molecules in solution shows that without the environment, the density of states is the same for both force field sets. Including the environmental point charges, however, the excitation energy distribution gets broader and, depending on the applied methods, also asymmetric. The excitation energy distribution predicted using TDDFT together with the AMBER force field shows a symmetric, Gaussian-like distribution.},

These behaviors are quantified through accurate path integral calculations. Under low-temperature, weakly dissipative conditions, we observe unusual, nonmonotonic population dynamics when the two-level system is initially placed in its ground state. We also analyze the origin of the system-bath interactions responsible for the nonmonotonic behavior of purity during relaxation. Our results show that classical dephasing processes arising from site level fluctuations lead to a monotonic decay of purity, and that the quantum mechanical decoherence events associated with spontaneous phonon emission are responsible for the subsequent recovery of purity. Last, we show that coupling with a low-temperature bath can purify a mixed two-level system. In the case of the maximally mixed initial RDM, the purity increases monotonically even during short time.},

A simple theoretical analysis establishes bounds and limiting behaviors. The contributions to purity from a purely incoherent term obtained from the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix, a term associated with the difference of the two eigenstate populations, and a third term related to the square of the time derivative of a site population, are discussed in various regimes. In the case of tunneling dynamics from a localized initial condition, the complex interplay among these contributions leads to the recovery of purity under low-temperature, weakly dissipative conditions. Memory effects from the bath are found to play a critical role to the dynamics of purity. It is shown that the strictly quantum mechanical decoherence process associated with spontaneous phonon emission is responsible for the long-time recovery of purity. These analytical and numerical results show clearly that the loss of quantum coherence during the evolution toward equilibrium does not necessarily imply the decay of purity, and that the time scales relevant to these two processes may be entirely different.},

  abstract = {Rigorous approaches to the dynamics of quantum systems in large dissipative environments are extremely challenging, owing to the well-known exponential scaling. The work reported here builds up on existing highly accurate methods developed in our group, namely the quasi-adiabatic propagator (QuAPI) and the quantum-classical path integral (QCPI). In particular, we present the incorporation of Langevin friction by eliminating classical trajectories, and a time-dependent driving field to study light-matter interactions, to the framework of QCPI. We further introduce the possibility of using rigorous path integral methods in conjunction with master equation (GQME) methods and explore memory requirements of the different approaches. We show that while QuAPI and GQME have the same memory requirements, QCPI requires a much shorter quantum memory. This is associated with the ability of QCPI to include all classical memory effects within a time-dependent system propagator, a benefit which cannot be transferred to non-trajectory-based methods. Next, we turn our focus on a very interesting property of quantum mechanical systems, namely coherences, and its relation to purity of reduced systems. We show that while purity decays at high temperature classical regimes as predicted by short-time perturbative treatments and Gaussian decoherence mechanisms, pronounced quantum mechanical regimes see a significant long-time recovery in purity, even when coherent oscillations have completely decayed. A simple analysis shows three physically meaningful contributions to purity, one of which is purely quantum mechanical in origin and cannot be explained by classical decoherence, and is the dominating factor at long times in certain situations. We investigate the behavior in the exciton transfer in bacteriochlorophyll dimer, and show that purity is significantly recovered even at room temperatures in real systems. Finally, we investigate purity in the case of relaxation dynamics, where symmetry considerations lead to an entirely different picture. We identify distinct features for ground \& excited state initial conditions, and show that in the latter case purity always goes through its minimum, corresponding to a maximally mixed state. We also demonstrate that, contrary to common understanding, the environment can even purify systems in an initially mixed state.},

Further, we show that the memory length in iterative QCPI calculations is always shorter than the GQME kernel memory length. This stems from the ability of the QCPI methodology to pretreat all memory effects of a classical nature (i.e., those associated with phonon absorption and stimulated emission), as well as some of the quantum memory contributions (arising from spontaneous phonon emission). Furthermore, trajectory-based iterative QCPI simulations can fully account for important structural/conformational changes that may occur on very long time scales and that cannot be captured via master equation treatments.},

With strong system-bath coupling and high temperature, the purity decays monotonically to its fully mixed value, with a short-time Gaussian behavior, which is subsequently followed by exponential evolution. However, under low-temperature and weak coupling conditions, a substantial recovery of purity is observed. A simple theoretical analysis reveals three contributions that correspond to a completely incoherent, eigenstate population difference and rate terms. The last two of these terms can counter the early drop of purity and are responsible for its rebound. These findings caution against using purity as a measure of decoherence in the dynamics of quantum dissipative systems.},

It is shown that the Chebyshev operator (Tk(\^H)) can be considered as a discrete cosine type propagator (cos(K{$\Theta\sphat$})), in Which the angle operator ({$\Theta\sphat$} = arccos \^H) is a single-valued mapping of the scaled Hamiltonian (\^H) and the order (k) is an effective time. Properties in the angle domain (thus in energy domain) can be obtained from those in the order domain via a cosine Fourier transform. The equivalence and parallelism between the order-angle formulation and the time-energy formulation allow one to transplant existing time-dependent quantum mechanical methods. Compared with the time propagator, the Chebyshev propagator has a number of numerical advantages. Because of its polynomial form, the action of the Chebyshev propagator can be evaluated exactly except for roundoff errors. The three-term recursion formula for Chebyshev polynomials is stable and requires minimal memory. The discretization error in time propagation can be avoided because the Chebyshev propagator is naturally disrcrete. Additional computational savings over the time propagation are possible because the Chebyshev wave packet can be propagated in the real space. Various applications of the Chebyshev propagator are discussed.},

By the use of Suzuki'sforward-time derivative operator to enforce the time-ordered exponential, we show that the same decomposition can be used to solve nonautonomous equations. In particular, odd-order algorithms are derived on the basis of a highly nontrivial time-asymmetric kernel. Such an operator approach provides a general and unified basis for understanding structure nonpreserving algorithms and is especially useful in deriving very high-order algorithms via analytical extrapolations. In this work algorithms up to 100th order are tested by integrating the ground-state wave function of the hydrogen atom. For such a singular Coulomb problem, the multi-product expansion shows uniform convergence and is free of poles usually associated with structure-preserving methods. Other examples are also discussed.},

The S-factors from two different experiments are in good agreement. The dephasing rates of these vibrations deviate significantly from the band-gap law.

In this computational study, we provide a structural basis for a remarkable pH-dependent adaptation at the molecular level. Upon binding of the LHCX1 protein to the FCP complex together with a change in pH, conformational changes within the FCP protein result in a variation of the electronic coupling in a specific chlorophyll-fucoxanthin pair, leading to a change in the exciton transfer rate by almost an order of magnitude.

  abstract = {Abstract The development of M\o ller\textendash Plesset perturbation theory (MPPT) has seen four different periods in almost 80 years. In the first 40 years (period 1), MPPT was largely ignored because the focus of quantum chemists was on variational methods. After the development of many-body perturbation theory by theoretical physicists in the 1950s and 1960s, a second 20-year long period started, during which MPn methods up to order n = 6 were developed and computer-programed. In the late 1980s and in the 1990s (period 3), shortcomings of MPPT became obvious, especially the sometimes erratic or even divergent behavior of the MPn series. The physical usefulness of MPPT was questioned and it was suggested to abandon the theory. Since the 1990s (period 4), the focus of method development work has been almost exclusively on MP2. A wealth of techniques and approaches has been put forward to convert MP2 from a O(M5) computational problem into a low-order or linear-scaling task that can handle molecules with thousands of atoms. In addition, the accuracy of MP2 has been systematically improved by introducing spin scaling, dispersion corrections, orbital optimization, or explicit correlation. The coming years will see a continuously strong development in MPPT that will have an essential impact on other quantum chemical methods. \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

The excitation energy transfer in the photosynthetic system is tremendously efficient. In particular, we investigate the excitation energy transport in the Fenna\textendash Matthews\textendash Olson (FMO) complex. The exciton dynamics and excitation energy transfer (EET) depend on the interaction between the excited chromophores and their environment. Most theoretical models believe that all bacteriochlorophyll-a (BChla) sites are surrounded by the same local protein environment, which is contradicted by the structural analysis of the FMO complex. Based on different values of pigment\textendash protein coupling for different sites, measured in the adiabatic limit, we have theoretically investigated the effect of the heterogeneous local protein environment on the EET process. By the realistic and site-dependent model of the system\textendash bath couplings, the results show that this interaction may have a critical value for the coherent energy-transfer process. Furthermore, we verify that the two transport pathways are coherent and stable to the important parameter reorganization energy of environmental interactions. The quantum dynamical simulations show that the correlation fluctuation keeps the oscillation of the coherent excitation on a long timescale. In addition, due to the inhomogeneous pigment\textendash protein coupling, different BChl sites have asymmetric excitation oscillation timescales.},

  abstract = {An algorithm for the simulation of the evolution of slightly entangled quantum states has been recently proposed as a tool to study time-dependent phenomena in one-dimensional quantum systems. Its key feature is a time-evolving block-decimation (TEBD) procedure to identify and dynamically update the relevant, conveniently small, subregion of the otherwise exponentially large Hilbert space. Potential applications of the TEBD algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm, being based on updating a matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the DMRG community and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG techniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG implementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile `adaptive time-dependent DMRG' variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.},

  abstract = {We use matrix diagonalization in combination with real-time path integral methods to investigate the electronic eigenstates and exciton\textendash vibration dynamics of model dendrimers with Frenkel exciton interactions between adjacent segments, which characterize structures composed of conjugated molecules. Even in the absence of an explicit energetic gradient in the electronic Hamiltonian, exciton couplings create a funnel through the eigenstate hierarchy that pulls the excitation energy away from the periphery. The competition between eigenstate structure and entropic considerations dictates the equilibrium distribution, which in small dendrimers at low temperatures tends to favor the core, shifting outward with increasing dendrimer size and thermal energy, although this distribution can be skewed back toward the core by increasing the exciton coupling between segments of the same generation. At high temperatures the distribution becomes classical, with all excited segments having the same population. Strong exciton\textendash vibration coupling also shifts the equilibrium distribution in the classical direction. We find that the dynamics of excitation energy transfer is highly nontrivial and strongly affected by quantum mechanical effects. A positive value of the intrageneration coupling (regardless of the sign of the intergeneration coupling parameter) introduces a very slow component to the dynamics, which we attribute to electronic frustration. With exciton coupling, vibrational reorganization energy and thermal energy of approximately the same magnitude, the energy transfer dynamics is characterized by time scales that span 2 orders of magnitude. The rich dynamics that results from a single-parameter electronic Hamiltonian suggests a multitude of design possibilities for dendrimeric structures with a desirable function.},

The evolution of the state populations is then obtained from the short-time simulation results and the solution of the kinetic equations with the computed rate matrix. These expressions generalize the reactive flux method and its nonequilibrium version to multistate processes and show that even in the completely incoherent limit of rate kinetics, the time evolution of populations is governed by coherences. Further, we show that by virtue of detailed balance, the short-time values of the imaginary components of coherences fully determine the equilibrium populations.},

In particular, the spread, signs, and shapes of the coherence maps collectively characterize the state of the system and the nature of the dynamics, as well as the equilibrium state. The topology of the system is readily reflected in its coherence map. Rows and columns show the composition of quantum superpositions, and their filling indicates the extent of the surviving coherence. Linear combinations of imaginary RDM elements specify instantaneous population derivatives. The main diagonal comprises the incoherent component of the dynamics, while the upper/lower triangular areas give rise to coherent contributions that increase the purity of the RDM. In open systems, the coherence map evolves to a band surrounding the principal diagonal whose width decreases with increasing temperature and dissipation strength. We illustrate these behaviors with examples of 10-site model molecular aggregates with Frenkel exciton couplings, where the electronic states of each monomer are coupled to harmonic vibrational baths.},

Due to recent developments in nanophotonics, exciton-cavity structures with very strong light-matter coupling rates can be fabricated. We show that in such structures, a regime emerges where the decoherence is completely suppressed due to decoupling of the dominant phonon process. Using a numerically exact tensor network approach, we perform calculations in this nonperturbative, non-Markovian dynamical regime. Here, we identify a strategy for reaching near-unity photon indistinguishability and also discover an interesting phonon dressing of the exciton-cavity polaritons in the high-Q regime, leading to multiple phonon sidebands when the light-matter interaction is sufficiently strong.},

  abstract = {The general theory of quantum mechanics is now almost complete, the imperfections that still remain being in connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas. These give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions, in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass with velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei. The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It there fore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation. Already before the arrival of quantum mechanics there existed a theory of atomic structure, based on Bohr's ideas of quantised orbits, which was fairly successful in a wide field. To get agreement with experiment it was found necessary to introduce the spin of the electron, giving a doubling in the number of orbits of an electron in an atom. With the help of this spin and Pauli's exclusion principle, a satisfactory theory of multiplet terms was obtained when one made the additional assumption that the electrons in an atom all set themselves with their spins parallel or antiparallel. If s denoted the magnitude of the resultant spin angular momentum, this s was combined vectorially with the resultant orbital angular momentum l to give a multiplet of multiplicity 2s + 1. The fact that one had to make this additional assumption was, however, a serious disadvantage, as no theoretical reasons to support it could be given. It seemed to show that there were large forces coupling the spin vectors of the electrons in an atom, much larger forces than could be accounted for as due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electrons. The position was thus that there was empirical evidence in favour of these large forces, but that their theoretical nature was quite unknown.},

Unfortunately, path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of fermions are severely restricted by the notorious fermion sign problem (FSP). In this paper, we present a hands-on discussion of the FSP and investigate in detail its manifestation with respect to temperature, system size, interaction-strength and -type, and the dimensionality of the system. Moreover, we analyze the probability distribution of fermionic expectation values, which can be non-Gaussian and fat-tailed when the FSP is severe. As a practical application, we consider electrons and dipolar atoms in a harmonic confinement, and the uniform electron gas in the warm dense matter regime. In addition, we provide extensive PIMC data, which can be used as a reference for the development of new methods and as a benchmark for approximations.},

  abstract = {We have revisited the 2D spectroscopy of the excitation energy transfer in the Fenna\textendash Matthews\textendash Olson (FMO) protein. Based on 2D spectroscopic signatures, the energy transfer dynamics in the FMO protein has been argued to be supported by long-lived electronic quantum coherence on timescales up to 1.5 ps. In contrast, our analysis, based on experimental data and confirmed by theoretical calculations, shows that the electronic decoherence occurs within 60 fs, in agreement with typical dephasing times in systems under these conditions. Given the relatively well-defined structure of the FMO protein, and comparative couplings between chlorophylls to other photosynthetic systems, the observed extremely fast decoherence should be viewed as general, bringing to question any significant quantum coherent transport contributions to photosynthesis.During the first steps of photosynthesis, the energy of impinging solar photons is transformed into electronic excitation energy of the light-harvesting biomolecular complexes. The subsequent energy transfer to the reaction center is commonly rationalized in terms of excitons moving on a grid of biomolecular chromophores on typical timescales \&lt;100 fs. Today's understanding of the energy transfer includes the fact that the excitons are delocalized over a few neighboring sites, but the role of quantum coherence is considered as irrelevant for the transfer dynamics because it typically decays within a few tens of femtoseconds. This orthodox picture of incoherent energy transfer between clusters of a few pigments sharing delocalized excitons has been challenged by ultrafast optical spectroscopy experiments with the Fenna\textendash Matthews\textendash Olson protein, in which interference oscillatory signals up to 1.5 ps were reported and interpreted as direct evidence of exceptionally long-lived electronic quantum coherence. Here, we show that the optical 2D photon echo spectra of this complex at ambient temperature in aqueous solution do not provide evidence of any long-lived electronic quantum coherence, but confirm the orthodox view of rapidly decaying electronic quantum coherence on a timescale of 60 fs. Our results can be considered as generic and give no hint that electronic quantum coherence plays any biofunctional role in real photoactive biomolecular complexes. Because in this structurally well-defined protein the distances between bacteriochlorophylls are comparable to those of other light-harvesting complexes, we anticipate that this finding is general and directly applies to even larger photoactive biomolecular complexes.},

  abstract = {In the primary step of natural light harvesting, the solar photon energy is captured in a photoexcited electron?hole pair, or an exciton, in chlorophyll. Its conversion to chemical potential occurs in the special pair reaction center, which is reached by downhill ultrafast excited-state energy transport through a network of chromophores. Being inherently quantum, transport could in principle occur via a matter wave, with vast implications for efficiency. How long a matter wave remains coherent is determined by the intensity by which the exciton is disturbed by the noisy biological environment. The stronger this is, the stronger the electronic coupling between chromophores must be to overcome the fluctuations and phase shifts. The current consensus is that under physiological conditions, quantum coherence vanishes on the 10-fs time scale, rendering it irrelevant for the observed picosecond transfer. Yet, at low-enough temperature, quantum coherence should in principle be present. Here, we reveal the onset of longer-lived electronic coherence at extremely low temperatures of ?20 K. Using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, we determine the exciton coherence times in the Fenna?Matthew?Olson complex over an extensive temperature range. At 20 K, coherence persists out to 200 fs (close to the antenna) and marginally up to 500 fs at the reaction center. It decays markedly faster with modest increases in temperature to become irrelevant above 150 K. At low temperature, the fragile electronic coherence can be separated from the robust vibrational coherence, using a rigorous theoretical analysis. We believe that by this generic principle, light harvesting becomes robust against otherwise fragile quantum effects.},

  abstract = {For complex molecules, nuclear degrees of freedom can act as an environment for the electronic ``system'' variables, allowing the theory and concepts of open quantum systems to be applied. However, when molecular system-environment interactions are non-perturbative and non-Markovian, numerical simulations of the complete system-environment wave function become necessary. These many body dynamics can be very expensive to simulate, and extracting finite-temperature results\textemdash which require running and averaging over many such simulations\textemdash becomes especially challenging. Here, we present numerical simulations that exploit a recent theoretical result that allows dissipative environmental effects at finite temperature to be extracted efficiently from a single, zero-temperature wave function simulation. Using numerically exact time-dependent variational matrix product states, we verify that this approach can be applied to vibronic tunneling systems and provide insight into the practical problems lurking behind the elegance of the theory, such as the rapidly growing numerical demands that can appear for high temperatures over the length of computations.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) provide a numerically exact approach for computing the reduced dynamics of a quantum system linearly coupled to a bath. We have found that HEOM contains temperature-dependent instabilities that grow exponentially in time. In the case of continuous-bath models, these instabilities may be delayed to later times by increasing the hierarchy dimension; however, for systems coupled to discrete, nondispersive modes, increasing the hierarchy dimension does little to alleviate the problem. We show that these instabilities can also be removed completely at a potentially much lower cost via projection onto the space of stable eigenmodes; furthermore, we find that for discrete-bath models at zero temperature, the remaining projected dynamics computed with few hierarchy levels are essentially identical to the exact dynamics that otherwise might require an intractably large number of hierarchy levels for convergence. Recognizing that computation of the eigenmodes might be prohibitive, e.g., for large or strongly coupled models, we present a Prony filtration algorithm that may be useful as an alternative for accomplishing this projection when diagonalization is too costly. We present results demonstrating the efficacy of HEOM projected via diagonalization and Prony filtration. We also discuss issues associated with the non-normality of HEOM.},

  abstract = {Quantum coherence controls almost every aspect of static and dynamic response of a strongly correlated quantum system, although details of this control have not been elucidated in many cases. We find that, in the presence of a significant static off-diagonal coupling, quantum coherence can survive much longer than the bath correlation time in a noisy environment. In the presence of time correlated noise (non-Markovian limit), coherence could propagate through the excited bath states, and this plays a nontrivial role in giving rise to a noncanonical temperature dependence of population distribution in an extended conjugated polymer-like system. The quantum coherence through the excited bath states vanishes in the high temperature limit, giving rise to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. Second, we discuss a role of quantum coherence in exciton localization that bears resemblance to Anderson localization. Calculations have been carried out not only with a chain of conjugated polymer but also with dimer and trimer subunits of the Fenna\textendash Matthews\textendash Olson (FMO) complex. We derive an analytical expression of the relation between steady state coherence and excitionic population distribution. We analytically showed that steady state coherence in equilibrium bath states is governed by interchromophoric coupling (J) whereas coherence in excited bath states is dictated by fluctuation strength (Vd) for the spatially correlated bath model. For the spatially uncorrelated bath model, we observe that at the low temperature limit coherence in the excited bath states dominates over coherence in equilibrium bath states and vice versa. In the study of the localization problem, we analytically show that, in the limit of a negligibly small fluctuation rate (bd), the diffusion coefficient is exactly proportional to the fluctuation rate, leading to complete breakdown of the Haken\textendash Strobl\textendash Silbey Markovian prediction.},

Focusing specifically on the case of liquid oxygen, we calculate the classical force-force time correlation function using a molecular dynamics simulation and then determine various approximations to the relaxation rate constant by applying the schemes considered earlier. The Egelstaff scheme is found to lead to reasonable agreement with experiment.},

The study reveals electronic quantum beats characteristic of wavelike energy motion within the bacteriochlorophyll complex from the green sulphur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum.

  abstract = {"Richard Feynman is one of, if not the, most famous physicists of the latter half of the 20th century. In 1964, at Cornell University, he delivered the famous Messenger Lectures. This book, The Character of Physical Law, sprung from these lectures. In this classic work, Feynman explores the relationship between math and physics, describes the great conservation principles, the puzzle of symmetry in physical law, how to reconcile physical problems that yield infinite results with their manifestations in the natural world, and quantum mechanical views of nature. Feynman's accessible speech and conversational style comes through well in each essay; his simple pencil and paper drawings communicate complex ideas as if one were viewing them on a chalk board. This reissue features a foreword by Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek, which situates the work within modern scholarship and describes why the book is still relevant today. Although he mentions areas where Feynman's theories need "updating," he points out that Feynman's unorthodox and brilliant way of thinking helped develop the general quantum electrodynamics theory, one of the most precise and accurate theories in physical science. Wilczek concludes with the assertion that this book represents Feynman at "the height of his powers, and that this "is the single best introduction to modern physics, altogether.""--},

A new wave function is proposed here. The new value computed for {$\Delta$} is 11.5\textdegree K. Qualitatively, the wave function suggests that the roton is a kind of quantum-mechanical analog of a microscopic vortex ring, of diameter about equal to the atomic spacing. A forward motion of single atoms through the center of the ring is accompanied by a dipole distribution of returning flow far from the ring. In the computation both the two-atom and three-atom correlation functions appear. The former is known from x-rays, while for the latter the Kirkwood approximation of a product of three two-atom correlation functions is used. A method is developed to estimate and correct for most of the error caused by this approximation, so that the residual uncertainty due to this source is negligible.},

  abstract = {A formalism has been developed, using Feynman's space-time formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics whereby the behavior of a system of interest, which is coupled to other external quantum systems, may be calculated in terms of its own variables only. It is shown that the effect of the external systems in such a formalism can always be included in a general class of functionals (influence functionals) of the coordinates of the system only. The properties of influence functionals for general systems are examined. Then, specific forms of influence functionals representing the effect of definite and random classical forces, linear dissipative systems at finite temperatures, and combinations of these are analyzed in detail. The linear system analysis is first done for perfectly linear systems composed of combinations of harmonic oscillators, loss being introduced by continuous distributions of oscillators. Then approximately linear systems and restrictions necessary for the linear behavior are considered. Influence functionals for all linear systems are shown to have the same form in terms of their classical response functions. In addition, a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived relating temperature and dissipation of the linear system to a fluctuating classical potential acting on the system of interest which reduces to the Nyquist-Johnson relation for noise in the case of electric circuits. Sample calculations of transition probabilities for the spontaneous emission of an atom in free space and in a cavity are made. Finally, a theorem is proved showing that within the requirements of linearity all sources of noise or quantum fluctuation introduced by maser-type amplification devices are accounted for by a classical calculation of the characteristics of the maser.},

Molecular theories of liquid dynamics are able to rationalize such variations over at least a 2000-fold range of time scale.

How should we approach and characterize this long and multifaceted time period? In this sense, The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic is fundamentally different from other Cambridge Companions (more than 500 titles by now), most of which treat discrete topics such as a single century, an individual author, or a single work of literature. As noted in the introduction to the first edition, because the Latin language does not have words for ``the'' or ``a,'' the Romans themselves did not speak of ``the Roman Republic.'' Moreover, the Latin expression res publica (from which our word republic is derived) can refer to a broad spectrum of political concepts from a state or commonwealth in general (regardless of its political culture) to a particularly Roman form of government characterized by annual election of magistrates, voting to pass legislation in assemblies of citizens, and equality of these Roman citizens before the law.},

  abstract = {"Quantum field theory is the mathematical and conceptual framework that describes the physics of the very small, including subatomic particles and quasiparticles. It is used to address a range of problems across subfields, from high-energy physics and gravitation to statistical physics and condensed matter physics. Despite the breadth of its applications, however, the teaching of quantum field theory has historically been strongly oriented toward high-energy physics students, while others-particularly in condensed matter and statistical physics-are typically taught in a separate course, or take an alternate sequence in many-body and statistical physics. Author Eduardo Fradkin strongly believes that this separation is both artificial and detrimental to all groups' understanding of quantum field theory. This textbook, developed from a graduate course Fradkin has taught for decades at the University of Illinois, offers a new, "multicultural" approach to the subject that seeks to remedy this fragmentation. It covers both basic techniques and topics at the frontiers of current research, and integrates modern concepts and examples from high-energy, statistical, and condensed-matter physics alike. Extensive problem sets further illustrate applications across a range of subfields. The book will be suitable for students across physical subdisciplines who have mastered graduate-level quantum mechanics, and will be a useful reference for researchers"--},

  abstract = {A time response over almost 5 decades (from 10-13 to about 10-8 s) to a (sub)picosecond laser pulse excitation has been observed in the Fenna, Matthews, and Olson (FMO) antenna protein trimer. The FMO protein is unique in having a fine-structured bacteriochlorophyll a Qy exciton absorption spectrum over the whole investigated temperature range between 6 and 160 K. As measured by a two-color pump-probe differential absorption, the population decay of the exciton states of seven strongly coupled bacteriochlorophyll a molecules in a protein monomer is the dominant dynamical process in the subpicosecond time domain. The through-band scattering takes a few picoseconds and depends only weakly on temperature, probably because of a low density of exciton states. At low temperatures, evidence for a slow pico-nanosecond relaxation process has also been obtained via time-dependent red-shift and broadening of the exciton emission spectrum. Two nonexclusive tentative interpretations to this effect have been provided. The phenomenon may be due to exciton solvation in the surrounding protein and water-glycerol matrix or/and due to slow scattering of closely spaced bacteriochlorophyll a exciton states in a protein trimer. The shape of the excited-state absorption spectrum (arising from transitions between singly and doubly excited exciton states) and its oscillator strength has been roughly estimated from the analysis of the pump-probe spectrum. The spectrum peaks at around 805 nm and is less featured compared to the ground-state absorption spectrum. Both spectra have comparable strength.},

  abstract = {Spectral characteristics of the optically excited states in the ring-shaped quasi-one-dimensional aggregates comprising 18 and 32 tightly coupled bacteriochlorophyll a molecules have been investigated using selective spectroscopy methods and theoretical modelling of the data. Distinguished by the lowest electronic transition energies in the LH2 and LH1 antenna complexes these aggregates govern the functionally important ultrafast funneling of solar excitation energy in the photosynthetic membranes of purple bacteria. It was found by using a sophisticated differential fluorescence line narrowing method that exciton\textendash phonon coupling in terms of the dimensionless Huang\textendash Rhys factor is strong in these systems, justifying an excitonic polaron theoretical approach for the data analysis. Although we reached this qualitative conclusion already previously, in this work essential dependence of the exciton\textendash phonon coupling strength and reorganization energy on excitation wavelength as well as on excitation light fluence has been established. We then show that these results corroborate with the properties of excitonic polarons in diagonally disordered ensembles of the aggregates. Furthermore, the weighted density of states of the phonon modes, which is an important characteristic of dynamical systems interacting with their surroundings, was derived. Its shape, being similar for all studied circular aggregates, deviates significantly from a reference profile describing local response of a protein to the Qy electronic transition in a single bacteriochlorophyll a molecule. Similarities of the data for regular and B800 deficient mutant LH2 complexes indicate that the B800 pigments have no direct influence on the electronic states of the B850 aggregate system. Consistent set of model parameters was determined, unambiguously implying that excitonic polarons, rather than bare excitons are proper lowest-energy optical excitations in the LH1 and LH2 antenna complexes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we compare the ability of different quasiclassical mapping Hamiltonian methods to accurately simulate the absorption spectra of multiexcitonic molecular systems. Two distinctly different approaches for simulating the absorption spectra are considered: (1) a perturbative approach, which relies on the first-order perturbation theory with respect to the field-matter interaction; (2) a nonperturbative approach, which mimics the experimental measurement of the absorption spectra from the free-induction decay that follows a short laser pulse. The methods compared are several variations of the linearized semiclassical (LSC) method, the symmetrical quasiclassical (SQC) method, and the mean-field (Ehrenfest) method. The comparison is performed in the context of a biexcitonic model and a seven-excitonic model of the Fenna\textendash Matthews\textendash Olson (FMO) complex. The accuracy of the various methods is tested by comparing their predictions to the quantum-mechanically exact results obtained via the hierarchy of the equations of motion (HEOM) method, as well as to the results based on the Redfield quantum master equation. The results show that the LSC-based quasiclassical mapping Hamiltonian methods can yield the accurate and robust absorption spectra in the high-temperature and/or slow-bath limit, where the nuclear degrees of freedom can be treated as classical.},

As distinct from TFD, our method implements the doubling of thermalized degrees of freedom only, and relies upon the explicitly constructed generalized thermal Bogoliubov transformation, which is not restricted to fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. This renders the present approach computationally efficient and applicable to a large variety of systems.},

It covers everything you need to build and maintain larger code bases, write powerful and flexible applications and libraries, and confidently expand the scope and complexity of your projects. Author Jon Gjengset takes you deep into the Rust programming language, dissecting core topics like ownership, traits, concurrency, and unsafe code. You'll explore key concepts like type layout and trait coherence, delve into the inner workings of concurrent programming and asynchrony with async/await, and take a tour of the world of no\_std programming. Gjengset also provides expert guidance on API design, testing strategies, and error handling, and will help develop your understanding of foreign function interfaces, object safety, procedural macros, and much more. You'll learn: \textbullet How to design reliable, idiomatic, and ergonomic Rust programs based on best principles \textbullet Effective use of declarative and procedural macros, and the difference between them \textbullet How asynchrony works in Rust - all the way from the Pin and Waker types used in manual implementations of Futures, to how async/await saves you from thinking about most of those words \textbullet What it means for code to be unsafe, and best practices for writing and interacting with unsafe functions and traits \textbullet How to organize and configure more complex Rust projects so that they integrate nicely with the rest of the ecosystem \textbullet How to write Rust code that can interoperate with non-Rust libraries and systems, or run in constrained and embedded environments Brimming with practical, pragmatic insights that you can immediately apply, Rust for Rustaceans helps you do more with Rust, while also teaching you its underlying mechanisms.},

In LHZ an infinite-range spin-glass is mapped onto the low energy subspace of a spin-1/2 lattice gauge model with quasi-local four-body parity constraints. This spin model can be emulated in a natural way with Rubidium and Caesium atoms in a bipartite optical lattice involving laser-dressed Rydberg\textendash Rydberg interactions, which are several orders of magnitude larger than the relevant decoherence rates. This makes the exploration of coherent quantum enhanced optimization protocols accessible with state-of-the-art atomic physics experiments.},

  abstract = {Aggregation-induced/enhanced emission (AIE/AEE) materials have aroused wide attention for their potential applications in optoelectronic devices and biosensors. In this paper, the working mechanism of a new kind of AEE-active luminogen, tetraphenylpyrazine (TPP) and its derivatives, is studied by first-principles calculations contrasting their pyrazine core with an inherent n \textrightarrow{} {$\pi$}* transition. Our results indicate that the attachment of phenyl rings to the pyrazine core can change the n \textrightarrow{} {$\pi$}* transition component to {$\pi$} \textrightarrow{} {$\pi$}* via the electronic conjugated effect and evoke restriction of intramolecular motion (RIM) that is responsible for the AEE characteristics. Decoration of the TPP peripheries with electron-withdrawing CF3 groups hardly affects the electronic transition properties and barely improves the solid-state luminescence. Substitution of the peripheral phenyls with electron-donating OCH3 groups thoroughly opens up the radiative channel and greatly enhances the emission quantum efficiency. Moreover, CF3 and OCH3 substituents can respectively generate extra CH{$\cdots$}F/F{$\cdots$}F/CF{$\cdots\pi$} and CH{$\cdots$}O interactions, which could promote RIM and slow down the non-radiative decay process. The experimental results confirm the theoretical predictions well. The above modulation guideline can be summarized from a molecular picture: the phenyl attachment reduces the n \textrightarrow{$\pi$}* transition component and evokes RIM, while the substituent decoration imparts altered electronic conjugation and promotes RIM. Our work not only offers valuable insight into AEE phenomena, but also provides a strategy for the rational design of efficient heterocycle-containing emitters.},

  abstract = {The XXZ model is a canonical model of quantum magnetism. In one dimension, this model is integrable and has ballistically moving quasiparticles; thus, energy spreads ballistically, but, surprisingly, spin transport can be diffusive or superdiffusive. Here, we show that spin transport is even richer in the presence of a magnetic field: Some fraction of the spin moves out ballistically, but the dynamical spin-structure factor decays with an anomalous, continuously varying exponent. A hitherto-unnoticed phase transition takes place at finite fields, separating ballistic from subballistic decay of local correlations. We analytically derive these results using generalized hydrodynamics and support our findings numerically. These anomalous exponents can readily be measured via the frequency and wavevector dependence of the spin conductivity. We compute the spin-structure factor of XXZ spin chains in the Heisenberg and gapped (Ising) regimes in the high-temperature limit for nonzero magnetization, within the framework of generalized hydrodynamics, including diffusive corrections. The structure factor shows a hierarchy of timescales in the gapped phase, owing to s-spin magnon bound states (``strings'') of various sizes. Although short strings move ballistically, long strings move primarily diffusively as a result of their collisions with short strings. The interplay between these effects gives rise to anomalous power-law decay of the spin-structure factor, with continuously varying exponents, at any fixed separation in the late-time limit. We elucidate the cross-over to diffusion (in the gapped phase) and to superdiffusion (at the isotropic point) in the half-filling limit. We verify our results via extensive matrix product operator calculations.},

The review begins with the discussion of single flexible or semiflexible linear polymer chains subjected to two noises, thermal and active. The active noise has either Gaussian or non-Gaussian distribution but has a memory, accounting for the persistent motion of the active bath particles. This finite persistence makes the reconfiguration dynamics of the chain slow as compared to the purely thermal case and the chain swells. The active noise also results superdiffusive or ballistic motion of the tagged monomer. We present all the calculations in details but mainly focus on the analytically exact or almost exact results on the topic, as obtained from our group in recent years. In addition, we briefly mention important works of other groups and include some of our new results. The review concludes with pointing out the implications of polymer chains in active bath in biologically relevant context and its future directions.},

In this context, the famous Caldeira\textendash Leggett model that enables quantum and classical treatment of Brownian motion on equal footing has enjoyed popularity. Although this model is by any means a useful theoretical tool, its ability to describe anharmonic dynamics of real systems is often taken for granted. In this Letter, we show that the mapping between a molecular system under study and the model cannot be established in a self-consistent way, unless the system part of the potential is taken effectively harmonic. Mathematically, this implies that the mapping is not invertible. This ``invertibility problem'' is not dependent on the peculiarities of particular molecular systems and is rooted in the anharmonicity of the system part of the Caldeira\textendash Leggett model potential.},

Such highly structured environments give rise to long-lived bath correlations that induce complex dynamics which are very difficult to simulate. These difficulties are further aggravated when spatial correlations between different parts of the system are important. By modeling the dynamics of a pair of two-level quantum systems in a common, structured, environment we show that a recently developed general purpose numerical approach, the time-evolving matrix product operator, is capable of accurate simulation under exactly these conditions. We find that tuning the separation to match the wavelength of the dominant environmental modes can drastically modify the system dynamics. To further explore this behavior, we show that the full dynamics of the bath can be calculated directly from those of the system, thus allowing us to develop intuition for the complex dynamics observed.},

A strategy for manipulating two-qubit states of colloidal NC hetero-dimers is described. We show that a sequence of laser pulses with the same photon energy can bring excitonic states of a nanocrystal hetero-dimer into entanglement and perform arbitrary qubit rotations (quantum gates). Our simulations of a realistic two-particle assembly of CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs demonstrate that such two-qubit gate operations can be driven by optical parametric oscillators with a theoretical error of 0.1\%. A strategy for upscaling two-qubit hetero-dimers to N-qubit exciton gates in semiconductor NC assemblies is discussed.},

However, the molecular origin of the enhanced rates remains unclear as in the case of spontaneous appearance of 1 {$\mu$}M hydrogen peroxide in water microdroplets. In this Letter, we consider the range of ionization energies and whether interfacial electric fields of a microdroplet can feasibly overcome the high energy step from hydroxide ions (OH\textendash ) to hydroxyl radicals (OH\textbullet ) in a primary H2O2 mechanism. We find that the vertical ionization energies (VIEs) of partially solvated OH\textendash{} ions are greatly lowered relative to the average VIE in the bulk liquid, unlike the case of the Cl\textendash{} anion which shows no reduction in the VIEs regardless of solvation environment. Overall reduced hydrogen-bonding and undercoordination of OH\textendash{} are structural features that are more readily present at the air\textendash water interface, where the energy scale for ionization can be matched by statistically probable electric field values.},

EPs feature in classical as well as in quantum mechanical problems. They are associated with symmetry breaking for -symmetric Hamiltonians, where a great number of experiments has been performed, in particular in optics, and to an increasing extent in atomic and molecular physics. EPs are involved in quantum phase transition and quantum chaos; they produce dramatic effects in multichannel scattering, specific time dependence and more. In nuclear physics, they are associated with instabilities and continuum problems. Being spectral singularities they also affect approximation schemes. This article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical devoted to `Quantum physics with non-Hermitian operators'.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a new approach to semiclassical dynamics which exploits the fact that extended wavefunctions for heavy particles (or particles in harmonic potentials) may be decomposed into time-dependent wave packets, which spread minimally and which execute classical or nearly classical trajectories. A Gaussian form for the wave packets is assumed and equations of motion are derived for the parameters characterizing the Gaussians. If the potential (which may be nonseparable in many coordinates) is expanded in a Taylor series about the instantaneous center of the (many-particle) wave packet, and up to quadratic terms are kept, we find the classical parameters of the wave packet (positions, momenta) obey Hamilton's equation of motion. Quantum parameters (wave packet spread, phase factor, correlation terms, etc.) obey similar first order quantum equations. The center of the wave packet is shown to acquire a phase equal to the action integral along the classical path. State-specific quantum information is obtained from the wave packet trajectories by use of the superposition principle and projection techniques. Successful numerical application is made to the collinear He + H2 system widely used as a test case. Classically forbidden transitions are accounted for and obtained in the same manner as the classically allowed transitions; turning points present no difficulties and flux is very nearly conserved.},

Specific trial functions are discussed for several applications, including the curve crossing problem. The useful semiclassical content of the time dependent Hartree approximation is discussed.

In this work an initial wavefunction or quantum density operator is expanded in a complete set of grussian wavepackets. It is demonstrated that the time evolution of this wavepacket expansion for the quantum wavefunction or density is correctly given within the approximations employed by the classical propagation of the avarage position and momentum of each gaussian packet, holding the shape of these individual gaussians fixed. The semiclassical approximation is employed for the quantum propagator and the stationary phase approximation for certain integrals is utilized in this derivation. This analysis demonstrates that the divergence of the classical trajectories associated with the individual gaussian packets accounts for the changes in shape of the quantum wavefunction or density, as has been suggested on intuitive grounds by Heller. The method should be exact for quadratic potentials and this is verified by explicitly applying it for the harmonic oscillator example.},

The neural network model developed in this work simulates long-time dynamics efficiently and accurately across different dynamical regimes from weakly damped coherent motion to incoherent relaxation. The model was trained on a data set relevant to photosynthetic excitation energy transfer and can be deployed to study long-lasting quantum coherence phenomena observed in light-harvesting complexes. Furthermore, our model performs well for the initial conditions different than those used in the training. Our approach reduces the required computational resources for long-time simulations and holds the promise for becoming a valuable tool in the study of open quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Nonequilibrium states of closed quantum many-body systems defy a thermodynamic description. As a consequence, constraints such as the principle of equal a priori probabilities in the microcanonical ensemble can be relaxed, which can lead to quantum states with novel properties of genuine nonequilibrium nature. In turn, for the theoretical description it is in general not sufficient to understand nonequilibrium dynamics on the basis of the properties of the involved Hamiltonians. Instead it becomes important to characterize time-evolution operators, which adds time as an additional scale to the problem. In this perspective article we summarize recent progress in the field of dynamical quantum phase transitions, which are phase transitions in time with temporal nonanalyticities in matrix elements of the time-evolution operator. These transitions are not driven by an external control parameter, but rather occur due to sharp internal changes generated solely by unitary real-time dynamics. We discuss the obtained insights on general properties of dynamical quantum phase transitions, their physical interpretation, potential future research directions, as well as recent experimental observations.},

  abstract = {Luminescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are one of the more popular nanomaterials currently utilized within biological applications. However, what is not widely appreciated is their growing role as versatile energy transfer (ET) donors and acceptors within a similar biological context. The progress made on integrating QDs and ET in biological configurations and applications is reviewed in detail here. The goal is to provide the reader with (1) an appreciation for what QDs are capable of in this context, (2) how this field has grown over a relatively short time span, and, in particular, (3) how QDs are steadily revolutionizing the development of new biosensors along with a myriad of other photonically active nanomaterial-based bioconjugates. An initial discussion of QD materials along with key concepts surrounding their preparation and bioconjugation is provided given the defining role these aspects play in the QDs ability to succeed in subsequent ET applications. The discussion is then divided around the specific roles that QDs provide as either F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or charge/electron transfer donor and/or acceptor. For each QD-ET mechanism, a working explanation of the appropriate background theory and formalism is articulated before examining their biosensing and related ET utility. Other configurations such as incorporation of QDs into multistep ET processes or use of initial chemical and bioluminescent excitation are treated similarly. ET processes that are still not fully understood such as QD interactions with gold and other metal nanoparticles along with carbon allotropes are also covered. Given their maturity, some specific applications ranging from in vitro sensing assays to cellular imaging are separated and discussed in more detail. Finally a perspective on how this field will continue to evolve is provided.},

We find that the spinon heat conductivity {$\kappa$}mag is strongly enhanced as compared to previous results obtained on samples with lower chemical purity. The analysis of {$\kappa$}mag allows the computation of the spinon mean free path lmag as a function of temperature. At low temperature we find lmag {$\sim$} 0.5 \textmu m, corresponding to more than 1200 chain unit cells. Upon increasing the temperature, the mean free path decreases strongly and approaches an exponential decay {$\sim$} (1/T)exp(Tu*/T), which is characteristic for Umklapp processes with the energy scale kBTu*. Based on Matthiessen's rule we decompose lmag into a temperature-independent spinon\textendash defect scattering length l0 and a temperature-dependent spinon\textendash phonon scattering length lsp(T). By comparing lmag(T) of Sr2CuO3 with that of SrCuO2, we show that the spin\textendash phonon interaction, as expressed by lsp, is practically the same in both systems. The comparison of the empirically derived lsp with model calculations for the spin\textendash phonon interaction of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 XY model yields reasonable agreement with the experimental data.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the variation of the intrinsic domain magnetization of a ferromagnetic with the external magnetic field, is obtained. The basis of the treatment is the exchange interaction model amplified by explicit consideration of the dipole-dipole interaction between the atomic magnets. Approximations appropriate to low temperatures and equivalent to those used by Bloch in his derivation of the T1 law, are introduced. The resultant expression for the intrinsic volume susceptibility decreases slowly with increasing field; at high fields the functional dependence is as the inverse square root of the field. The variation with temperature is linear; at room temperature and for fields of about 4000 gauss, the order of magnitude of the (volume) susceptibility is 10-4. The results are compared with experiment and satisfactory agreement is found.},

  abstract = {We propose a nonequilibrium variational polaron transformation, based on an ansatz for nonequilibrium steady state with an effective temperature, to study quantum heat transport at the nanoscale. By combining the variational polaron transformed master equation with the full counting statistics, we extended the applicability of the polaron-based framework to study nonequilibrium process beyond the super-Ohmic bath models. Previously, the polaron-based framework for quantum heat transport reduces exactly to the non-interacting blip approximation (NIBA) formalism for Ohmic bath models due to the issue of the infrared divergence associated with the full polaron transformation. The nonequilibrium variational method allows us to appropriately treat the infrared divergence in the low-frequency bath modes and explicitly include cross-bath correlation effects. These improvements provide more accurate calculation of heat current than the NIBA formalism for Ohmic bath models. We illustrate the aforementioned improvements with the nonequilibrium spin-boson model in this work and quantitatively demonstrate the cross-bath correlation, current turnover, and rectification effects in quantum heat transfer.},

Mutation-induced perturbation to the exciton structure and the optical spectra of the complex provide a suitable means to investigate the critical role played by the protein scaffold. In this work, we have performed quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics calculations over the molecular dynamics simulation trajectories with the polarized protein-specific charge scheme for both wild-type FMOs and two mutants. Our result reveals that a single-point mutation in the vicinity of BChl 6, namely, W183F of C. tepidum, significantly affects the absorption spectrum, resulting in a switch of the absorption spectrum from type 2, for which the 806 nm band is more pronounced than the 815 nm band, to type 1, for which the 815 nm band is pronounced. Our observations agree with the single-point mutation experiments reported by Saer et al. (Biochim. Biophys. Acta, Bioenerg. 2017, 1858, 288\textendash 296) and Khmelnitskiy et al. (J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2018, 9, 3378\textendash 3386). In contrast, the absorption spectrum of the P. aestuarii experiences the opposite transition (from type 1 to type 2) upon the same mutation. Furthermore, by comparing the contributions of individual pigments to the spectra in the wild type and its mutant, we find that a single-point mutation near BChl 6 not only induces changes in excitation energy of BChl 6 per se but also affects the excitonic structures of the neighboring BChls 5 and 7 through strong interpigment electronic couplings, resulting in a significant change in the absorption spectra.},

Although we were able to give an accurate formulation of the method, we had at the time of writing that paper only an intuitive, heuristic understanding of the deeper causes which make the method work. A more mathematical understanding was needed. To close this gap we show in this paper the equivalence of the new method with a first order expansion of {$\hslash$} of the Schr\"odinger equation. We further prove that the new method is equivalent to the stationary phase approximation, using the usual WKB formula for the propagator. The latter equivalence enables us to show that all the symmetry properties of time-dependent quantum mechanics also hold in the new semiclassical theory. Finally, we provide some elaboration of the method, and clarify several issues that were not discussed before. With this new insight we are able to formulate a simple rule for the calculation of semiclassical wave functions that contain contributions from more than one branch. This corrects for the divergence of semiclassical wave functions near caustics, a problem that we encountered in the preceding paper.},

  abstract = {Simulating electron\textendash nucleus coupled dynamics poses a nontrivial challenge and an important problem in the investigation of ultrafast processes involving coupled electronic and vibrational dynamics. Because irreversibility of the system dynamics results from thermal activation and dissipation caused by the environment, in dynamical studies, it is necessary to include heat bath degrees of freedom in the total system. When the system dynamics involves high-energy electronic transitions, the environment is regarded to be in a low-temperature regime and we must treat it quantum mechanically. In this Article, we present rigorous and versatile approaches for investigating the dynamics of open systems with coupled electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom within a fully quantum mechanical framework. These approaches are based on a quantum Fokker\textendash Planck equation and a quantum Smoluchowski equation employing a heat bath with an Ohmic spectral density, with non-Markovian low-temperature correction terms, and extensions of these equations to the case of multistate systems. The accuracy of these equations was numerically examined for a single-state Brownian system, while their applicability was examined for multistate double-well systems by comparing their results with those of the fewest-switch surface hopping and Ehrenfest methods with a classical Markovian Langevin force. Comparison of the transient absorption spectra obtained using these methods clearly reveals the importance of the quantum low-temperature correction terms. These equations allow us to treat nonadiabatic dynamics in an efficient way, while maintaining numerical accuracy. The C++ source codes that we developed, which allow for the treatment of the phase and coordinate space dynamics with any single-state or multistate potential forms, are provided as Supporting Information.},

The central concept concerns the so-called quasilocal conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of locality. Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of quasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined, specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved operators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model, and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges, manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are presented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport properties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in the quantum quench scenario.},

The numerical results reveal that quantum wave-like motion persists for several hundred femtoseconds even at physiological temperature, and suggest that the FMO complex may work as a rectifier for unidirectional energy flow from the peripheral light-harvesting antenna to the reaction center complex by taking advantage of quantum coherence and the energy landscape of pigments tuned by the protein scaffold. A potential role of quantum coherence is to overcome local energetic traps and aid efficient trapping of electronic energy by the pigments facing the reaction center complex.},

  abstract = {The accuracies of the excited-state dipole and quadrupole moments obtained by TD-DFT are assessed by considering 16 different exchange-correlation functionals and more than 30 medium and large molecules. Except for excited-state presenting a significant charge-transfer character, a relatively limited dependency on the nature of the functional is found. It also turns out that while DFT ground-state dipole moments tend to be too large, the reverse trend is obtained for their excited-state counterparts, at least when hybrid functionals are used. Consequently, the TD-DFT excess dipole moments are often too small, an error that can be fortuitously corrected for charge-transfer transition by selecting a pure or a hybrid functional containing a small share of exact exchange. This error-cancelation phenomena explains the contradictory conclusions obtained in previous investigations. Overall, the largest correlation between CC2 and TD-DFT excess dipoles is obtained with M06-2X, but at the price of a nearly systematic underestimation of this property by ca. 1 D. For the excess quadrupole moments, the average errors are of the order of 0.2\textendash 0.6 D{$\cdot$}\AA{} for the set of small aromatic systems treated.},

  abstract = {"When electrons are confined to two dimensions, cooled to near absolute zero temperature, and subjected to a strong magnetic field, they form an exotic new collective state of matter, which rivals superfluidity and superconductivity in both its scope and the elegance of the phenomena associated with it. Investigations into this state began in the 1980s with the observations of integral and fractional quantum Hall effects, which are among the most important discoveries in condensed matter physics. The fractional quantum Hall effect and a stream of other unexpected findings are explained by a new class of particles: composite fermions. A self-contained and pedagogical introduction to the physics and experimental manifestations of composite fermions, this textbook is ideal for graduate students and academic researchers in this rapidly developing field. The topics covered include the integral and fractional quantum Hall effects, the composite fermion Fermi sea, geometric observations of composite fermions, various kinds of excitations, the role of spin, edge state transport, electron solid, and bilayer physics. The author also discusses fractional braiding statistics and fractional local charge. This textbook contains numerous exercises to reinforce the concepts presented in the book."--Publisher's description},

This scheme is ideally designed for electronic spectroscopy; however, the method can be applied in a straightforward way to vibrational spectroscopy as well. Our scheme performs dynamics only for the t2 duration, eliminating explicit t1 and t3 coherent dynamics and thus can achieve dramatic improvements in efficiency. To gain this efficiency, we assume the system is in the inhomogeneous regime and that there is no significant nonadiabatic transfer of population during the t1 and t3 coherence times. Preliminary results are presented for the Frenkel Hamiltonian. We obtain excellent agreement with numerically exact results (which are possible for this simplistic model Hamiltonian), capturing all relevant trends at least qualitatively (and sometimes quantitatively).},

The high accuracy is demonstrated by simulating the optical spectra of vibronic model systems ranging from an exactly solvable dimer model to a more complex real-world perylene bisimide (PBI) J-aggregate. The relationship between the 0\textendash 0 emission strength and the exciton thermal coherent length is discussed for linearly stacked aggregates.

  abstract = {Certain organic materials can generate more than one electron-hole pair per absorbed photon, a property that could revolutionize the prospects for solar energy. This process, called singlet fission, is one possible ``exciton multiplication'' scheme that could be useful in a variety of photovoltaic device designs from dye-sensitized solar cells to solar cell bilayers to bulk heterojunctions. For such applications to be possible, however, singlet fission must occur with near perfect efficiency in compounds that also have other requisite properties such as strong visible light absorption and photostability. Many recent investigations of singlet fission have focused on crystalline polyacenes, which have been known for some time to undergo singlet fission. While these materials have promise, limitations in stability, cost, and performance may hinder practical application of polyacene solar cells, while their complex photophysics may limit our fundamental understanding of singlet fission in crystalline polyacenes.In this Account, we describe rationally designed singlet fission chromophores whose excited state dynamics should be fairly simple and whose coupling can be well controlled through the formation of covalent dimers, aggregates, or polycrystalline films. In principle, investigations of these chromophores should provide the clearest connection to theoretical concepts explaining how an excited state evolves from a singlet (S1) into two triplets (TT). Realizing the promise of efficient singlet fission rests with two tasks: (i) producing an ideal molecular energy level structure and (ii) inducing the correct type and strength of chromophore coupling. In this Account, we offer theoretical guidance for achieving (i) and consider more extensively recent results aimed at (ii).For (i), theoretical guidance suggests that, in addition to alternant hydrocarbons like tetracene and pentacene, biradicals (i.e., molecules with two independent radical centers) may also be used as the basis for designing chromophores with low-lying triplet states such that the energy relationship 2E(T1) {$\leq$} E(S1) is satisfied. Although molecules that do not fulfill this condition can also exhibit singlet fission from a higher lying or vibrationally excited singlet state, fast relaxation processes will likely reduce the singlet fission yield and complicate determination of the singlet fission mechanism.For (ii), once an appropriate chromophore has been chosen, the task of coupling two or more of them together must be done carefully. We discuss three pathways by which a dimer could undergo singlet fission: (1) A direct route in which slipped cofacial stacking is favorable under certain conditions. Cofacial stacking is common in molecular crystals, and it is likely not a coincidence that recent reports of efficient singlet fission involve slipped-stacked molecules in polycrystalline thin films. (2) A mediated route in which S1 interacts with (TT) through a virtual radical cation/anion state, which may be important in some situations. (3) A two-step route (i.e., through a real charge transfer intermediate) which others have suggested theoretically. We present data on 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) dimers that are consistent with this pathway.Finally, we review potential solar photoconversion efficiency gains utilizing singlet fission in several contexts.},

Then, we use this connection to motivate a tensor network algorithm for the simulation of multitime correlations in open systems, building on recent work where the influence functional is represented in terms of time evolving matrix product operators. By exploiting the symmetries of the influence functional, we are able to use our algorithm to achieve orders-of-magnitude improvement in the efficiency of the resulting numerical simulation. Our improved algorithm is then applied to compute exact phonon emission spectra for the spin-boson model with strong coupling, demonstrating a significant divergence from spectra derived under commonly used assumptions of memorylessness.},

The build-up of such patterns in experiments with electrons has been described as the ``most beautiful experiment in physics''8,9,10,11. Here, we show how a combination of nanofabrication and nano-imaging allows us to record the full two-dimensional build-up of quantum interference patterns in real time for phthalocyanine molecules and for derivatives of phthalocyanine molecules, which have masses of 514 AMU and 1,298 AMU respectively. A laser-controlled micro-evaporation source was used to produce a beam of molecules with the required intensity and coherence, and the gratings were machined in 10-nm-thick silicon nitride membranes to reduce the effect of van der Waals forces. Wide-field fluorescence microscopy detected the position of each molecule with an accuracy of 10 nm and revealed the build-up of a deterministic ensemble interference pattern from single molecules that arrived stochastically at the detector. In addition to providing this particularly clear demonstration of wave\textendash particle duality, our approach could also be used to study larger molecules and explore the boundary between quantum and classical physics.},

  abstract = {Progress in the atomic-scale modeling of matter over the past decade has been tremendous. This progress has been brought about by improvements in methods for evaluating interatomic forces that work by either solving the electronic structure problem explicitly, or by computing accurate approximations of the solution and by the development of techniques that use the Born\textendash Oppenheimer (BO) forces to move the atoms on the BO potential energy surface. As a consequence of these developments it is now possible to identify stable or metastable states, to sample configurations consistent with the appropriate thermodynamic ensemble, and to estimate the kinetics of reactions and phase transitions. All too often, however, progress is slowed down by the bottleneck associated with implementing new optimization algorithms and/or sampling techniques into the many existing electronic-structure and empirical-potential codes. To address this problem, we are thus releasing a new version of the i-PI software. This piece of software is an easily extensible framework for implementing advanced atomistic simulation techniques using interatomic potentials and forces calculated by an external driver code. While the original version of the code (Ceriotti et al., 2014) was developed with a focus on path integral molecular dynamics techniques, this second release of i-PI not only includes several new advanced path integral methods, but also offers other classes of algorithms. In other words, i-PI is moving towards becoming a universal force engine that is both modular and tightly coupled to the driver codes that evaluate the potential energy surface and its derivatives.

  abstract = {Intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) impacts the dynamics of reactions in a profound way. Theoretical and experimental studies are increasingly indicating that accounting for the finite rate of energy flow is critical for uncovering the correct reaction mechanisms and calculating accurate rates. This requires an explicit understanding of the influence and interplay of the various anharmonic (Fermi) resonances that lead to the coupling of the vibrational modes. In this regard, the local random matrix theory (LRMT) and the related Bose-statistics triangle rule (BSTR) model have emerged as powerful and predictive quantum theories for IVR. In this Perspective we highlight the close correspondence between LRMT and the classical phase space perspective on IVR, primarily using model Hamiltonians with three degrees of freedom. Our purpose for this is threefold. First, this clearly brings out the extent to which IVR pathways are essentially classical, and hence crucial towards attempts to control IVR. Second, given that LRMT and BSTR are designed to be applicable for large molecules, the exquisite correspondence observed even for small molecules allows for insights into the quantum ergodicity transition. Third, we showcase the power of modern nonlinear dynamics methods in analysing high dimensional phase spaces, thereby extending the deep insights into IVR that were earlier gained for systems with effectively two degrees of freedom. We begin with a brief overview of recent examples where IVR plays an important role and conclude by mentioning the outstanding problems and the potential connections to issues of interest in other fields.},

Evaluation is based on a more careful comparison to experiment than has been provided in the past. J(\$\o mega\$) describes the frequency-dependent coupling of the system to the bath and is an important component in calculations of excitation energy transfer times. On the basis of the shape of experimental J(\$\o mega\$) obtained for several photosynthetic complexes, we argue that the shape of J(\$\o mega\$) strongly depends on the pigment\textendash protein complex. We show that many densities (especially the Drude\textendash Lorentz/constant damping Brownian oscillator) display qualitatively wrong behavior when compared to experiment. Because of divergence of J(\$\o mega\$) at zero frequency, the Brownian oscillator cannot fit a single-site spectrum correctly. It is proposed that a log-normal distribution can be used to fit experimental data and exhibits desired attributes for a physically meaningful phonon J(\$\o mega\$), in contrast to several commonly used spectral densities which exhibit low-frequency behavior in qualitative disagreement with experiment. We anticipate that the log-normal J(\$\o mega\$) function proposed in this work will be further tested in theoretical modeling of both time- and frequency-domain data.},

Our iterative full counting statistics path integral (iFCSPI) approach extends a previously well-established influence functional path integral method, by going beyond reduced system dynamics to provide the cumulant generating function of heat exchange. The method is straightforward; we implement it for the nonequilibrium spin boson model to calculate transient and long-time observables, focusing on the steady-state heat current flowing through the system under a temperature difference. Results are compared to perturbative treatments and demonstrate good agreement in the appropriate limits. The challenge of converging nonequilibrium quantities, currents and high order cumulants, is discussed in detail. The iFCSPI, a numerically exact technique, naturally captures strong system-bath coupling and non-Markovian effects of the environment. As such, it is a promising tool for probing fundamental questions in quantum transport and quantum thermodynamics.},

On the basis of the relation between such a general correlation function and that for the position variable, and the analytical result for the relation of quantum and classical correlation functions of position for harmonic baths, we develop an approximate expression for the quantum correction to the general classical correlation function as an expansion in the quantum correction. The quantum corrected correlation function only requires classical correlation functions and their derivatives with respect to time and temperature. Hence, the result can be implemented directly using only computer simulated classical data. Application to analytically solved model problems involving harmonic baths demonstrates that the method is accurate both for highly nonlinear coupling and surprisingly small temperature.},

This strong size dependence may explain that extrapolations from various numerical approaches yield conflicting results.},

The hierarchy of the equations of motion of the Green'f functions is decoupled at a stage one-step further than Tyablikov's decoupling. The thermal average of the spin component, {$\ll$} Sz \&gt;, is set to zero, becaure the long-range order does not exist in one dimension. Instead, our Green's functions are expressed in terms of the correlation functions cn {$\equiv$}4{$\ll$} S0zSnz \&gt;. The Green's function is essentially of the form representing undamped spin waves, whose spactrum depends on c1, c2 and one more parameter. They are determined by the requirement that c1 and c2 should be self-consistent and that c0 should be unity. The self-consistency equations have been solved analytically at high- and low-temperature limits, and also solved numerically in the whole range of the temperature. Thermodynamic quantities have been calculated using these solutions.It has turned out that the theory gives the correct high-temperature expansion for the thermodynamic quantities and the correlation functions. The latter is expressed by cn = (J / 4 kBT )n. In the case of ferromagnetic coupling, the correlation function cn at T = 0 is equal to 1/3 for all n's. This is what is expected from the correct ground state of the ferromagnetic Heisenberg system. The spin-wave spectrum at T = 0 also agrees with the correct one. At T {$\ll$}J/ kB, we find that the specific heat goes as T1/2 and the susceptibility goes as T-2. The gross feature of the temperature-dependence of the thermodynamic quantities agrees with Bonner and Fisher. In the case of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, we find c1 = -0.55407 and c2 = 0.16100 at T = 0, which are fairly close to the exact values. The thermodynamic quantities are also in gross agreement with Bonner and Fisher.},

The expansion coefficients of the initial superposition are updated after each semiclassical propagation period by implementing the Husimi Transform analytically in the basis of closely overlapping Gaussians. An advantage of the resulting time-sliced thawed Gaussian (TSTG) method is that it allows for full-quantum dynamics propagation without any kind of multidimensional integral calculation, or inversion of overlap matrices. The accuracy of the TSTG method is demonstrated as applied to simulations of quantum tunneling, showing quantitative agreement with benchmark calculations based on the split-operator Fourier transform method.},

The possible advantages of endothermic singlet fission (enhanced use of photon energy and larger triplet energies for coupling with common absorbers) motivated us to assess the role of exciton delocalization in the activation of this process. Here we report the synthesis of a series of linear perylene oligomers that undergo endothermic singlet fission and have endothermicities in the range 5\textendash 10\,kBT at room temperature in solution. We study these compounds using transient spectroscopy and modelling to unravel the singlet and triplet dynamics. We show that the minimal number of coupled chromophores needed to undergo endothermic singlet fission is three, which provides sufficient statistical space for triplet excitons to separate and avoid annihilation\textemdash and a subsequent fast return to the singlet state. Our data additionally suggest that torsional motion of chromophores about the molecular axis following triplet-pair separation contributes to the increase in entropy, thus lengthening the triplet lifetime in longer oligomers.},

  abstract = {Strong excitonic interactions are a key design strategy in photosynthetic light harvesting, expanding the spectral cross-section for light absorption and creating considerably faster and more robust excitation energy transfer. These molecular excitons are a direct result of exceptionally densely packed pigments in photosynthetic proteins. The main light-harvesting complexes of diatoms, known as fucoxanthin?chlorophyll proteins (FCPs), are an exception, displaying surprisingly weak excitonic coupling between their chlorophyll (Chl) a?s, despite a high pigment density. Here, we show, using single-molecule spectroscopy, that the FCP complexes of Cyclotella meneghiniana switch frequently into stable, strongly emissive states shifted 4?10 nm toward the red. A few percent of isolated FCPa complexes and ?20\% of isolated FCPb complexes, on average, were observed to populate these previously unobserved states, percentages that agree with the steady-state fluorescence spectra of FCP ensembles. Thus, the complexes use their enhanced sensitivity to static disorder to increase their light-harvesting capability in a number of ways. A disordered exciton model based on the structure of the main plant light-harvesting complex explains the red-shifted emission by strong localization of the excitation energy on a single Chl a pigment in the terminal emitter domain due to very specific pigment orientations. We suggest that the specific construction of FCP gives the complex a unique strategy to ensure that its light-harvesting function remains robust in the fluctuating protein environment despite limited excitonic interactions.},

Rather than propagating the many-particle wavefunction or density matrix in time in the usual stepwise fashion, the MPI scheme proceeds by sequentially integrating over each unit after linking its quantum paths to those of its neighbour and leads to linear scaling with system length. This paper shows that the linking matrix can be further decomposed into a diagonal matrix and a product of low-dimensional matrices, which can be applied sequentially. This factorisation changes the cost scaling from L2 to LlogL, where L is the number of quantum paths, leading to dramatic savings that are analogous to those attained by the fast Fourier transform algorithm and allowing application of the MPI procedure to systems with larger units and to longer propagation times. Applications to spin chains and to electron-vibration dynamics in a large molecular aggregate illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.},

Using a model two-state system with displaced harmonic potential surfaces, we show analytically that the FC-HT interference gives rise to asymmetric intensity modification, which has the same sign for all transitions on one side of the 0\textendash 0 absorption line and the opposite sign in the equivalent fluorescence transitions, while the trend is exactly reversed for all transitions on the other side the 0\textendash 0 line. We examine the dependence of the absorption\textendash emission asymmetry on the mode frequency, Huang\textendash Rhys factor, and dipole moment parameters to show the recovery of symmetry with particular combinations of parameters and a crossover from fluorescence to absorption dominance. We illustrate the analytical predictions through numerically exact calculations in models of one and two discrete vibrational modes and in the presence of a harmonic dissipative bath. In addition to homogeneous broadening effects, we identify large asymmetric shifts of absorption and emission band maxima, which can produce the illusion of unequal frequencies in the ground and excited potential surfaces as well as a nontrivial modulation of spectral asymmetry by temperature, which results from the enhancement of transitions on one side of the 0\textendash 0 line.

The electronic populations exhibit strong damping effects, a lengthening of the EET time scale, and complex dynamical patterns, which depend on aggregate length, temperature, as well as electronic and vibrational initial conditions and which are not additive. The early evolution is dominated by high-frequency vibrational modes, but all modes are responsible for the observed dynamics after the initial 25 fs. Overall, we observe significant changes in the electronic populations upon varying the temperature between 0 and 600 K. With a Franck\textendash Condon (FC) initial excitation, a strongly coupled vibrational mode introduces new peaks to the dimer populations, which show very weak temperature sensitivity. The first of these peaks is also seen in the long aggregate, but subsequent recurrences appear strongly quenched and merged. These structures are drastically altered if a non-FC initial condition is assumed. Additional insights are obtained from the diagonal elements of the dimer electronic-vibrational reduced density matrix. We find that the vibronic peaks result from depletion of the crossing region during the early coherent evolution of the vibrational density away from the crossing point, which allows the premature back-transfer of excitation to the initially excited unit.},

Further, the SMatQCPI matrices only need to account for quantum contributions to decoherence, allowing high efficiency in challenging regimes of incoherent dynamics.

While all pigments are identical, the tighter packing of the inner B850 ring is responsible for the thermodynamic stabilization of the inner ring. Molecular vibrations enable the 1-ps flow of energy to the B850 states, which would otherwise be kinetically inaccessible. A classical treatment of the vibrations leads to uniform equilibrium distribution of the excitation, with only 67\% transferred to the inner ring. However, spontaneous fluctuations associated with the quantum motion of the nuclei increase the transfer efficiency to 90\%.

These methods involve step-by-step propagation of a generalized multi-time reduced density matrix with a propagator that includes influence functional interactions that span the bath-induced memory length. Low-frequency baths lead to long memory that can span many time steps, necessitating the use of filtering procedures that select and store only statistically significant path segments, avoiding storage of the entire sparse propagator. The present paper further enhances the iterative path integral methodology through a deterministic procedure that identifies at the start of the calculation all memory-length path segments whose weights exceed a chosen threshold and builds the propagator matrix for use in all propagation steps. A binning procedure allows efficient pairing of path segments required in the construction of the propagator. Additional savings are achieved via a simple criterion for assessing the adequacy of a chosen path selection threshold prior to propagation. Application to a tight-binding model for charge transfer in extended systems reveals the important role of bath-induced memory on the dynamics of these systems.},

  abstract = {A quantum system weakly coupled to a zero-temperature environment will relax, via spontaneous emission, to its ground-state. However, when the coupling to the environment is ultra-strong the ground-state is expected to become dressed with virtual excitations. This regime is difficult to capture with some traditional methods because of the explosion in the number of Matsubara frequencies, i.e., exponential terms in the free-bath correlation function. To access this regime we generalize both the hierarchical equations of motion and pseudomode methods, taking into account this explosion using only a biexponential fitting function. We compare these methods to the reaction coordinate mapping, which helps show how these sometimes neglected Matsubara terms are important to regulate detailed balance and prevent the unphysical emission of virtual excitations. For the pseudomode method, we present a general proof of validity for the use of superficially unphysical Matsubara-modes, which mirror the mathematical essence of the Matsubara frequencies.},

  abstract = {We consider rigorous path integral descriptions of the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a polyatomic environment, assuming that the latter is well approximated by classical trajectories. Earlier work has derived semiclassical or purely classical expressions for the influence functional from the environment, which should be sufficiently accurate for many situations, but the evaluation of quantum-(semi)classical path integral (QCPI) expressions has not been practical for large-scale simulation because the interaction with the environment introduces couplings nonlocal in time. In this work, we analyze the nature of the effects on a system from its environment in light of the observation [N. Makri, J. Chem. Phys. 109, 2994 (1998)] that true nonlocality in the path integral is a strictly quantum mechanical phenomenon. If the environment is classical, the path integral becomes local and can be evaluated in a stepwise fashion along classical trajectories of the free solvent. This simple ``classical path'' limit of QCPI captures fully the decoherence of the system via a classical mechanism. Small corrections to the classical path QCPI approximation may be obtained via an inexpensive random hop QCPI model, which accounts for some ``back reaction'' effects. Exploiting the finite length of nonlocality, we argue that further inclusion of quantum decoherence is possible via an iterative evaluation of the path integral. Finally, we show that the sum of the quantum amplitude factors with respect to the system paths leads to a smooth integrand as a function of trajectory initial conditions, allowing the use of Monte Carlo methods for the multidimensional phase space integral.},

The system is treated via a full path integral, while the dynamics of the environment is approximated in terms of classical trajectories. We obtain quantum-classical path integral (QCPI) expressions in which the trajectories can undergo transitions to other quantum states at regular time intervals, but the cumulative probability of these transitions is governed by the local strength of the state-to-state coupling as well as the magnitude of the solvent reorganization energy. If quantum effects in the coordinates of the environment are relatively weak, an inexpensive random hop approximation leads to accurate descriptions of the dynamics. We describe a systematic iterative scheme for including quantum mechanical corrections for the solvent by gradually accounting for nonlocal ``quantum memory'' effects. As the length of the included memory approaches the decoherence time of the environment, the iterative QCPI procedure converges to the full QCPI result. The methodology is illustrated with application to dissipative symmetric and asymmetric two-level systems.},

Unfortunately, the subject has gained a notorious reputation for difficulty, with forbidding looking mathematics and a peculiar diagrammatic language described in an array of unforgiving, weighty textbooks aimed firmly at aspiring professionals. However, quantum field theory is too important, too beautiful, and too engaging to be restricted to the professionals. This book on quantum field theory is designed to be different. It is written by experimental physicists and aims to provide the interested amateur with a bridge from undergraduate physics to quantum field theory. The imagined reader is a gifted amateur, possessing a curious and adaptable mind, looking to be told an entertaining and intellectually stimulating story, but who will not feel patronised if a few mathematical niceties are spelled out in detail. Using numerous worked examples, diagrams, and careful physically motivated explanations, this book will smooth the path towards understanding the radically different and revolutionary view of the physical world that quantum field theory provides, and which all physicists should have the opportunity to experience.--},

Unlike many standard textbooks on advanced mechanics, however, this present text eschews a primarily technical and formalistic treatment in favor of a fundamental, historical, philosophical approach. As the author remarks, there is a tremendous treasure of philosophical meaning" behind the great theories of Euler and Lagrange, Hamilton, Jacobi, and other mathematical thinkers. Well-written, authoritative, and scholarly, this classic treatise begins with an introduction to the variational principles of mechanics including the procedures of Euler, Lagrange, and Hamilton. Ideal for a two-semester graduate course, the book includes a variety of problems, carefully chosen to familiarize the student with new concepts and to illuminate the general principles involved. Moreover, it offers excellent grounding for the student of mathematics, engineering, or physics who does not intend to specialize in mechanics, but wants a thorough grasp of the underlying principles. The late Professor Lanczos (Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies) was a well-known physicist and educator who brought a superb pedagogical sense and profound grasp of the principles of mechanics to this work, now available for the first time in an inexpensive Dover paperback edition. His book will be welcomed by students, physicists, engineers, mathematicians, and anyone interested in a clear masterly exposition of this all-important discipline},

  abstract = {Various linear and nonlinear vibrational and electronic spectroscopy experiments in liquids are usually analyzed within the second-cumulant approximation, and therefore the fundamental quantity of interest is the equilibrium time-correlation function of the fluctuating transition frequency. In the usual approach the ``bath'' variables responsible for the fluctuating frequency are treated classically, leading to a classical time-correlation function. Alternatively, sometimes a quantum correction appropriate for relatively high temperatures is included, which adds an imaginary part to the classical time-correlation function. This approach, although appealing, does not satisfy detailed balance. One can consider a similar correction, but where detailed balance is satisfied, by using the harmonic quantum correction factor. In this article, we compare these approaches for a model system and two realistic examples. Our conclusion is that for linear spectroscopy the classical result is usually adequate, whereas for nonlinear spectroscopy it can be more important to include quantum corrections.},

  abstract = {An accurate approach for computing intermolecular and intrachromophore contributions to spectral densities to describe the electronic\textendash nuclear interactions relevant for modeling excitation energy transfer processes in light harvesting systems is presented. The approach is based on molecular dynamics (MD) calculations of classical correlation functions of long-range contributions to excitation energy fluctuations and a separate harmonic analysis and single-point gradient quantum calculations for electron\textendash intrachromophore vibrational couplings. A simple model is also presented that enables detailed analysis of the shortcomings of standard MD-based excitation energy fluctuation correlation function approaches. The method introduced here avoids these problems, and its reliability is demonstrated in accurate predictions for bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the Fenna\textendash Matthews\textendash Olson pigment\textendash protein complex, where excellent agreement with experimental spectral densities is found. This efficient approach can provide instantaneous spectral densities for treating the influence of fluctuations in environmental dissipation on fast electronic relaxation.},

  abstract = {We derive and assess two new classes of regularizers that cope with offending denominators in the single-reference second-order M\o ller\textendash Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). In particular, we discuss the use of two types of orbital energy dependent regularizers, {$\kappa$} and {$\sigma$}, in conjunction with orbital-optimized MP2 (OOMP2). The resulting fifth-order-scaling methods, {$\kappa$}-OOMP2 and {$\sigma$}-OOMP2, have been examined for bond-breaking, thermochemistry, nonbonded interactions, and biradical problems. Both methods with strong enough regularization restore restricted to unrestricted instability (i.e., Coulson\textendash Fischer points) that unregularized OOMP2 lacks when breaking bonds in H2, C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2. The training of the {$\kappa$} and {$\sigma$} regularization parameters was performed with the W4-11 set. We further developed scaled correlation energy variants, {$\kappa$}-S-OOMP2 and {$\sigma$}-S-OOMP2, by training on the TAE140 subset of the W4-11 set. Those new OOMP2 methods were tested on the RSE43 set and the TA13 set where unmodified OOMP2 itself performs very well. The modifications we made were found insignificant in these data sets. Furthermore, we tested the new OOMP2 methods on singlet biradicaloids using Yamaguchi's approximate spin-projection. Unlike the unregularized OOMP2, which fails to converge these systems due to the singularity, we show that regularized OOMP2 methods successfully capture strong biradicaloid characters. While further assessment on larger data sets is desirable, {$\kappa$}-OOMP2 with {$\kappa$} = 1.45 Eh\textendash 1 appears to combine favorable recovery of Coulson\textendash Fischer points with good numerical performance.},

With an estimated time resolution of approximately 25?fs, wave packet motions of vibrational modes up to 1600?cm?1 are recorded for coumarin?153 in ethanol. Two-color transient absorption at 13?fs time resolution are measured to confirm the result. Vibrational displacements between the ground and excited states and Huang?Rhys factors (HRFs) are calculated by quantum mechanical methods and are compared with the experimental results. HRFs calculated by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT reproduce the experiment adequately. This fluorescence-based method provides a unique and direct way to obtain the vibrational spectrum of a molecule in an electronic excited state and the HRFs, as well as the dynamics of excited states, and it might provide information on the structure of an excited state through the HRFs.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental and theoretical works have made much progress toward understanding nonequilibrium phenomena in thermalizing systems, which act as thermal baths for their small subsystems, and many-body localized systems, which fail to do so. The description of time evolution in many-body systems is generally challenging due to the dynamical generation of quantum entanglement. In this work, we introduce an approach to study quantum many-body dynamics, inspired by the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Focusing on a family of interacting, Floquet spin chains, we consider a Keldysh path-integral description of the dynamics. The central object in our approach is the influence matrix, which describes the effect of the system on the dynamics of a local subsystem. For translationally invariant models, we formulate a self-consistency equation for the influence matrix. For certain special values of the model parameters, we obtain an exact solution which represents a perfect dephaser (PD). Physically, a PD corresponds to a many-body system that acts as a perfectly Markovian bath on itself: at each period, it measures every spin. For the models considered here, we establish that PD points include dual-unitary circuits investigated in recent works. In the vicinity of PD points, the system is not perfectly Markovian, but rather acts as a bath with a short memory time. In this case, we demonstrate that the self-consistency equation can be solved using matrix-product states (MPS) methods, as the influence matrix temporal entanglement is low. A combination of analytical insights and MPS computations allows us to characterize the structure of the influence matrix in terms of an effective ``statistical-mechanics'' description. We finally illustrate the predictive power of this description by analytically computing how quickly an embedded impurity spin thermalizes. The influence matrix approach formulated here provides an intuitive view of the quantum many-body dynamics problem, opening a path to constructing models of thermalizing dynamics that are solvable or can be efficiently treated by MPS-based methods and to further characterizing quantum ergodicity or lack thereof.},

We recently showed that the exciton model could be used to coarse-grain electronic structure in multichromophoric systems, focusing on singly excited exciton states [Acc. Chem. Res. 2014, 47, 2857-2866]. However, our previous implementation excluded charge-transfer excited states, which can play an important role in light-harvesting systems and near-infrared optoelectronic materials. Recent studies have also emphasized the significance of charge-transfer in singlet fission, which mediates the coupling between the locally excited states and the multiexcitonic states. In this work, we report on an ab initio exciton model that incorporates charge-transfer excited states and demonstrate that the model provides correct charge-transfer excitation energies and asymptotic behavior. Comparison with TDDFT and EOM-CC2 calculations shows that our exciton model is robust with respect to system size, screening parameter, and different density functionals. Inclusion of charge-transfer excited states makes the exciton model more useful for studies of singly excited states and provides a starting point for future construction of a model that also includes double-exciton states.},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the ability of different quasiclassical mapping Hamiltonian methods to simulate the dynamics of electronic transitions through conical intersections. The analysis is carried out within the framework of the linear vibronic coupling (LVC) model. The methods compared are the Ehrenfest method, the symmetrical quasiclassical method, and several variations of the linearized semiclassical (LSC) method, including ones that are based on the recently introduced modified representation of the identity operator. The accuracy of the various methods is tested by comparing their predictions to quantum-mechanically exact results obtained via the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method. The LVC model is found to be a nontrivial benchmark model that can differentiate between different approximate methods based on their accuracy better than previously used benchmark models. In the three systems studied, two of the LSC methods are found to provide the most accurate description of electronic transitions through conical intersections.},

  abstract = {Singlet fission (SF), the conversion of one singlet exciton into two triplet excitons, could significantly enhance solar cell efficiency. Molecular crystals that undergo SF are scarce. Computational exploration may accelerate the discovery of SF materials. However, many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations of the excitonic properties of molecular crystals are impractical for large-scale materials screening. We use the sure-independence-screening-and-sparsifying-operator (SISSO) machine-learning algorithm to generate computationally efficient models that can predict the MBPT thermodynamic driving force for SF for a dataset of 101 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH101). SISSO generates models by iteratively combining physical primary features. The best models are selected by linear regression with cross-validation. The SISSO models successfully predict the SF driving force with errors below 0.2\,eV. Based on the cost, accuracy, and classification performance of SISSO models, we propose a hierarchical materials screening workflow. Three potential SF candidates are found in the PAH101 set.},

Here, we study the spin-boson model as a prototype. By utilizing the Majorana-fermion representation together with the polaron transformation, we establish a theoretical approach to analyze Green's functions of the spin-boson model. In contrast to conventional perturbation theories either in the tunneling energy or in the system-bath coupling strength, the proposed scheme gives reliable results over wide regimes of the coupling strength, bias, as well as temperature. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we consider the susceptibility as well as the symmetrized spin correlation function (SSCF) which can be expressed in terms of Green's functions. Thorough investigations are made on systems embedded in Ohmic or sub-Ohmic bosonic baths. We found the so-obtained SSCF is the same as that of the non-interacting blip approximation (NIBA) in unbiased systems while it is applicable for a wider range of temperature in the biased systems compared with the NIBA. We also show that a previous perturbation result is recovered as a weak coupling limit of the so-obtained SSCF. Furthermore, by studying the quantum criticality of the susceptibility, we confirm the validity of the quantum-to-classical mapping in the whole sub-Ohmic regime.},

In the limiting regime we derive a simple closed equation governing the dynamics, which in the continuum limit and for the initial step magnetization profile results in a solution expressed in terms of Fresnel integrals.},

In the isotropic and easy-axis regimes we find non-ballistic spin transport which we analyse in detail in terms of scaling exponents of the transported magnetization and scaling profiles of the spin density. While in the easy-axis regime we find accurate evidence of normal diffusion, the spin transport in the isotropic case is clearly super-diffusive, with the scaling exponent very close to 2/3, but with universal scaling dynamics which obeys the diffusion equation in nonlinearly scaled time.},

In this complex, only one violaxanthin population absorbing at 486nm is observed. All the CLH-bound carotenoid molecules are in all-trans configuration, and among the two Ifx-l carotenoid molecules, the red one is twisted, as is the red-absorbing lutein in LHCII trimers. Analysis of the carbonyl stretching region for Chl a excitations indicates CLH binds up to seven Chl a molecules in five non-equivalent binding sites, in reasonable agreement with sequence analyses which have identified eight potential coordinating residues. The binding modes and conformations of CLH-bound pigments are discussed with respect to the known structures of LHCII and FCP.},

Starting from an ab initio calculation of the charge and transition densities, atomic partial charges are determined such as to fit the resulting electrostatic potentials of the different states and the transition. The different intermolecular couplings are then obtained from the Coulomb couplings between the respective atomic partial charges. The excitation energy transfer couplings obtained in the present TrEsp (transition charge from electrostatic potential) method are compared with couplings obtained from the simple point-dipole and extended dipole approximations and with those from the ab initio transition},

While increasingly complex and interesting systems have been successfully tackled with relatively simple functional approximations, there has also been increasing awareness that these functionals tend to fail for certain classes of approximations. Here I review the fundamental challenges the approximate functionals have in describing double excitations and charge-transfer excitations, which are two of the most common impediments for the theory to be applied in a black-box way. At the same time, I describe the progress made in recent decades in developing functional approximations that give useful predictions for these excitations.},

To this end, Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations have been employed in a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) fashion for the ground state followed by excitation energy calculations again in a QM/MM scheme for the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. The self-consistent-charge density functional tight-binding (DFTB) method electrostatically coupled to a classical description of the environment was applied to perform the ground-state dynamics. Subsequently, long-range-corrected time-dependent DFTB calculations were performed to determine the excitation energy fluctuations of the individual bacteriochlorophyll a molecules. The spectral densities obtained using this approach show an excellent agreement with experimental findings. In addition, the fluctuating site energies and couplings were used to estimate the exciton transfer dynamics.},

  abstract = {In this mini review, we focus on recent advances in the atomistic modeling of biological light-harvesting (LH) complexes. Because of their size and sophisticated electronic structures, multiscale methods are required to investigate the dynamical and spectroscopic properties of such complexes. The excitation energies, in this context also known as site energies, excitonic couplings, and spectral densities are key quantities which usually need to be extracted to be able to determine the exciton dynamics and spectroscopic properties. The recently developed multiscale approach based on the numerically efficient density functional tight-binding framework followed by excited state calculations has been shown to be superior to the scheme based on pure classical molecular dynamics simulations. The enhanced approach, which improves the description of the internal vibrational dynamics of the pigment molecules, yields spectral densities in good agreement with the experimental counterparts for various bacterial and plant LH systems. Here, we provide a brief overview of those results and described the theoretical foundation of the multiscale protocol.},

For a given set of blips, it is shown that the path sum with respect to the coordinates of all remaining time points is isomorphic to that for the wavefunction of a system subject to an external driving term and thus can be summed by an inexpensive iterative procedure. This exact decomposition reduces the number of terms by a factor that increases exponentially with propagation time. Further, under conditions (moderately high temperature and/or dissipation strength) that lead primarily to incoherent dynamics, the ``fully incoherent limit'' zero-blip term of the series provides a reasonable approximation to the dynamics, and the blip series converges rapidly to the exact result. Retention of only the blips required for satisfactory convergence leads to speedup of full-memory path integral calculations by many orders of magnitude.},

The QCPI methodology incorporates all effects associated with stimulated phonon absorption and emission as its crudest limit, thus can (in some regimes) converge faster than influence functional-based path integral methods specifically designed for system\textendash bath Hamiltonians. It is shown that the QCPI phase arising from a harmonic bath can be summed analytically with respect to the discrete bath degrees of freedom and expressed in terms of precomputed influence functional coefficients, avoiding the explicit enumeration of forced oscillator trajectories, whose number grows exponentially with the length of quantum memory. Further, adoption of the blip decomposition (which classifies the system paths based on the time length over which their forward and backward components are not identical) and a cumulative treatment of the QCPI phase between blips allows elimination of the majority of system paths, leading to a dramatic increase in efficiency. The generalization of these acceleration techniques to anharmonic environments is discussed.},

The starting point is the expression of the reduced density matrix for a quantum system interacting with a harmonic dissipative bath in the form of a forward-backward path sum, where the effects of the bath enter through the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. The path sum is evaluated iteratively in time by propagating an array that stores blip configurations within the memory interval. Convergence with respect to the number of blips and the memory length yields numerically exact results which are free of statistical error. In situations of strongly dissipative, sluggish baths, the algorithm leads to a dramatic reduction of computational effort in comparison with iterative path integral methods that do not implement the blip decomposition. This gain in efficiency arises from (i) the rapid convergence of the blip series and (ii) circumventing the explicit enumeration of between-blip path segments, whose number grows exponentially with the memory length. Application to an asymmetric dissipative two-level system illustrates the rapid convergence of the algorithm even when the bath memory is extremely long.},

It is shown that the latter becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit if the bath consists of independent modes coupled to the system via coefficients that scale appropriately with the size of the bath. Low-order correction terms to the linear response approximation are found to be given by multitime correlation functions of the force exerted by the bath on the system. Within a classical approximation, such correction terms can be obtained from molecular dynamics calculations and incorporated in the path integral, which can be evaluated by means of iterative procedures. Numerical calculations on an intrinsically nonlinear bath of two-level systems confirm the above behaviors and indicate that the deviations from the linear response approximation are more significant at low temperatures where quantum mechanical effects play an important role to the bath dynamics.},

The procedure is first presented for the simple topology of a single-file arrangement of units interacting via nearest neighbor couplings and subsequently extended to the calculation of two-particle correlations in arrays that may also contain some long-range interactions, to the treatment of systems with side chains or cyclic structures, to the simulation of internal dynamics in long organic molecules, and to the modifications required for coupling of one or several units of a system to dissipative environments.

The present Communication disentangles the path integral by recursively spreading the temporal entanglement over longer path segments, while decreasing its contribution. Eventually, the entangled term becomes sufficiently small and may be neglected, leading to iterative propagation of the RDM through simple multiplication of matrices whose size is equal to that of the bare system. It is found that the temporal entanglement length is practically equal to the bath-induced memory length.

In a recent Letter [Chem. Phys. Lett. 221, 482 (1994)], we demonstrated that the range of the nonlocal interactions is finite even at zero temperature, such that the nonlocal kernel extends over only a few time steps if the path integral is expressed in terms of accurate quasiadiabatic propagators. This feature arises from disruption of phase coherence in macroscopic environments and leads to Markovian dynamics for an augmented reduced density tensor, permitting iterative time evolution schemes. In the present paper we analyze the structure and properties of the relevant tensor propagator. Specifically, we show that the tensor multiplication scheme rigorously conserves the trace of the reduced density matrix, and that in cases of short-range nonlocality it leads to Redfield-type equations which are correct to all orders in perturbation theory and which take into account memory effects. We also argue that a simple eigenvector analysis reveals (without actual iteration) the nature of the dynamics and of the equilibrium state, and directly yields quantum reaction or relaxation rates.},

We report the experimental realization of an isotropic complete photonic band gap (PBG) in a 2D disordered dielectric structure. This structure is designed by a constrained optimization method, which combines advantages of both isotropy due to disorder and controlled scattering properties due to low-density fluctuations (hyperuniformity) and uniform local topology. Our experiments use a modular design composed of Al2O3 walls and cylinders arranged in a hyperuniform disordered network. We observe a complete PBG in the microwave region, in good agreement with theoretical simulations, and show that the intrinsic isotropy of this unique class of PBG materials enables remarkable design freedom, including the realization of waveguides with arbitrary bending angles impossible in photonic crystals. This experimental verification of a complete PBG and realization of functional defects in this unique class of materials demonstrate their potential as building blocks for precise manipulation of photons in planar optical microcircuits and has implications for disordered acoustic and electronic band gap materials.},

Progress towards realizing efficient SF-based devices has been impeded by the fact that only a handful of molecules and their derivatives practically exhibit efficient SF. In the present work, we demonstrate a TDDFT-based rapid and cost-effective computational approach for designing SF chromophores by doping various atomic sites (substituting carbon atoms) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon. We establish a hitherto unexplored, direct correlation between the atom-specific chemical reactivity parameter-Fukui function-of these molecules with their frontier molecular orbital energies, diradical characters, and vertical singlet and triplet excitation energies. These quantitative correlations show exactly opposite trends for nitrogen-doped molecules and phosphorus- or silicon-doped molecules. The doped derivatives that have the Fukui function falling in a range of 0.03\textendash 0.14 possess the required intermediate diradical character and suitable singlet\textendash triplet energies to qualify for SF candidature. Our findings enable one, at reasonable computational times and cost, to easily assess the doping criteria and to develop design rules for SF molecules in particular and for diradicaloids in general.},

In particular, we analyse the form of the ground state and excitations of the model, relating them to the symmetry-breaking physics, and illustrate aspects connected to calculating dynamical quantities, thermal averages, correlation functions and entanglement entropy. A few problems provide simple applications of the techniques.},

We find excellent agreement between the two methods across a generally difficult range of parameters. In particular, the variational master equation technique captures effects usually considered to be nonperturbative, such as multiphonon processes and bath-induced driving renormalization, and can give reliable results even in regimes in which previous master equation approaches fail.},

Most importantly, for example, it is not necessary to assume that the Hamiltonian is separable about the saddle point. It is argued that this model should provide an accurate description of the threshold region of the reaction where quantum effects are most significant. Finally, an even more general model, a new kind of semiclassical approximation, is presented which is essentially a synthesis of this quantum mechanical transition state model and the completely classical trajectory procedure for determining the rate constant; at sufficiently high temperatures, quantum effects become negligible, so that the correct rate constant is obtained; while at low temperature, the correct result is obtained because the transition state model becomes valid.},

Through evolution, genetic drift, and speciation, photosynthetic organisms have discovered many solutions for light harvesting. In this review, we describe the underlying photophysical principles by which this energy is absorbed, as well as the mechanisms of electronic excitation energy transfer (EET). First, optical properties of the individual pigment chromophores present in light-harvesting antenna complexes are introduced, and then we examine the collective behavior of pigment-pigment and pigment-protein interactions. The description of energy transfer, in particular multichromophoric antenna structures, is shown to vary depending on the spatial and energetic landscape, which dictates the relative coupling strength between constituent pigment molecules.

While this coupling is recognized as deriving from dynamic distortions about the first coordination sphere of the metal, a general model for understanding and quantifying ligand field contributions has not been established. Here we derive a general ligand field theory model to describe and quantify the nature of spin\textendash phonon coupling terms in S = 1/2 transition metal complexes. We show that the coupling term for a given vibrational mode is governed by: (1) the magnitude of the metal-based spin\textendash orbit coupling constant, (2) the magnitude and gradient in the ligand field excited state energy, which determines the magnitude of ground state orbital angular momentum, and (3) dynamic relativistic nephelauxetic contributions reflecting the magnitude and gradient in the covalency of the ligand\textendash metal bonds. From an extensive series of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations calibrated to a range of experimental data, spin\textendash phonon coupling terms describing minimalistic D4h/D2d [CuCl4]2- and C4v [VOCl4]2- complexes translate to and correlate with experimental quantum coherence properties observed for Cu(ii)- and V(iv)-based molecular qubits with different ligand sets, geometries, and coordination numbers. While providing a fundamental framework and means to benchmark current qubits, the model and methodology described herein can be used to screen any S = 1/2 molecular qubit candidate and guide the discovery of room temperature coherent materials for quantum information processing.},

It is shown that the oscillations often observed in the population relaxation of sites 1 and 2 may be completely suppressed in the eight-site model due to the initial preparation. Second it is demonstrated that while the presence of the eighth chromophore does not cause a dramatic change in the energy-transfer efficiency, it does however lead to a dominant energy-transfer pathway that can be characterized by an effective three-site system. Finally, we confirm that the energy-transfer process in the eight-site complex remains efficient and robust through computations of the optimal values of the bath parameters.},

As is well known, the classical dynamics of dissipative  systems may be described in terms of a generalized Langevin equation. The  continuum limit SCIVR uses the Langevin trajectories as input, albeit with a  quantum noise rather than a classical noise. Combining this development with the  forward-backward form of the prefactor-free propagator leads to a tractable  scheme for computing quantum thermal correlation functions. Here we present the  first implementation of this continuum limit SCIVR series method to study two  model problems of vibrational relaxation. Simulations of the dissipative harmonic  oscillator system over a wide range of parameters demonstrate that at most only  the first two terms in the SCIVR series are needed for convergence of the  correlation function. The methodology is then applied to the vibrational  relaxation of a dissipative Morse oscillator. Here, too, the SCIVR series  converges rapidly as the first two terms are sufficient to provide the quantum  mechanical relaxation with an estimated accuracy on the order of a few percent.  The results in this case are compared with computations obtained using the  classical Wigner approximation for the relaxation dynamics.},

Under low light conditions, some species of purple bacteria replace LH2 with light harvesting 3 (LH3), a variant form with almost the same structure as the former but with distinctively different spectral features. The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region.

  abstract = {The generalized quantum master equation (GQME) provides a powerful framework for simulating electronic energy, charge, and coherence transfer dynamics in molecular systems. Within this framework, the effect of the nuclear degrees of freedom on the time evolution of the electronic reduced density matrix is fully captured by a memory kernel superoperator. However, the actual memory kernel depends on the choice of projection operator and is therefore not unique. Furthermore, calculating the memory kernel can be done in multiple ways that use different forms of projection-free inputs. Although the electronic dynamics is invariant to those choices when quantum-mechanically exact projection-free inputs are used, this is not the case when they are obtained via more feasible semiclassical or mixed quantum-classical approximate methods. Furthermore, the accuracy and numerical stability of the resulting electronic dynamics has been observed to be sensitive to the above-mentioned choices when approximate methods are used to calculate the projection-free inputs. In this article, we provide a systematic road map to 30 possible pathways for calculating the memory kernel and highlight how they are related as well as the ways in which they differ. We also compare the performance of different pathways in the context of the spin-boson benchmark model, with the projection-free inputs obtained via a mapping Hamiltonian linearized semiclassical method. In this case, we find that expressing the memory kernel with an exponential operator where the projection operator precedes the Liouvillian yields the most accurate and most numerically stable results.},

Their accuracy heavily relies on the exchange-correlation energy functional, which encapsulates electron\textendash electron interaction beyond the classical model. As its universal form remains undiscovered, approximated functionals constructed with heuristic approaches are used for practical studies. However, there are problems in their accuracy and transferability, while any systematic approach to improve them is yet obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the functional can be systematically constructed using accurate density distributions and energies in reference molecules via machine learning. Surprisingly, a trial functional machine learned from only a few molecules is already applicable to hundreds of molecules comprising various first- and second-row elements with the same accuracy as the standard functionals. This is achieved by relating density and energy using a flexible feed-forward neural network, which allows us to take a functional derivative via the back-propagation algorithm. In addition, simply by introducing a nonlocal density descriptor, the nonlocal effect is included to improve accuracy, which has hitherto been impractical. Our approach thus will help enrich the DFT framework by utilizing the rapidly advancing machine-learning technique.},

The basic equation thus obtained has a form similar to Bloch's kinetic equation and reduces to the latter in the limit of a system of weakly interacting particles.

We find that the inclusion of particle exchange alters qualitatively the shape of the correlation function below the characteristic transition temperature but has no noticeable effect on the dynamics in the normal phase. The incoherent structure factor extracted from the velocity autocorrelation function is in very good agreement with neutron scattering data, reproducing the width, height, frequency shift, and asymmetry of the curves, as well as the observed increase in peak height characteristic of the superfluid phase. Our simulation demonstrates that the peak enhancement observed in the neutron scattering experiments below the transition temperature arises exclusively from particle exchange, illuminating the role of Bose-statistical effects on the dynamics of the quantum liquid.},

The latter are due either to propagating environmental modes or to local fluctuations with a finite localization length. A simple toy model of a single donor\textendash acceptor pair with spatially separated chromophore sites allows one to investigate the influence of these spatial correlations on quantum coherent excitation transfer. The sound velocity of the solvent determines the wavelength of the environmental modes, which, in turn, has to be compared to the spatial distance of the chromophore sites. When the wavelength exceeds the distance between donor and acceptor sites, we find a strong suppression of decoherence. In addition, we consider two spatially separated donor\textendash acceptor pairs under the influence of propagating environmental modes. Depending on their wavelengths fixed by the sound velocity of the solvent material, the spatial range of correlations may extend over typical interpair distances, which can lead to an increase in the decohering influence of the solvent. Surprisingly, this effect is counteracted by increasing temperature.},

The fluctuational spectra obtained there exhibit several discrete molecular vibrational modes and a surprisingly strong continuous background induced by the solvent. The latter alone causes overdamped excitonic dynamics, although its absolute strength might be somewhat overestimated. Nevertheless, it allows us to address the principal question of whether the discrete vibrational modes are strong enough to induce additional quantum coherent exciton dynamics which would be overdamped without them. We find that including them yields only negligible effects. By this, we can rule out a scenario of quantum coherence in the FMO exciton dynamics protected by the discrete molecular mode. Only when the dynamics is coherent already without the discrete modes, its coherence might be additionally enhanced.},

The present work shows that even in situations where the bath is characterized by high-frequency modes (which necessitate a small time step) and slow oscillators (which give rise to very long memory), efficient propagation that takes into account the memory on all time scales is feasible by renormalizing the propagator matrix to include successively larger-length influence functional correlations. At its crudest level, the renormalized propagator is an ordinary matrix, thus the computational demands of the method are very modest, similar to those for propagating the bare system. Yet, test applications on dissipative two-level systems show that the method produces accurate results in demanding situations. By including memory on successively increasing time scales, the method is capable of capturing nonexponential kinetics induced by sluggish solvents.},

  abstract = {Many-body interactions could lead to quantum thermalization, but long-range interactions provide an alternative. Although statistical mechanics describes thermal equilibrium states, these states may or may not emerge dynamically for a subsystem of an isolated quantum many-body system. For instance, quantum systems that are near-integrable usually fail to thermalize in an experimentally realistic time scale, and instead relax to quasi-stationary prethermal states that can be described by statistical mechanics, when approximately conserved quantities are included in a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We experimentally study the relaxation dynamics of a chain of up to 22 spins evolving under a long-range transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian following a sudden quench. For sufficiently long-range interactions, the system relaxes to a new type of prethermal state that retains a strong memory of the initial conditions. However, the prethermal state in this case cannot be described by a standard GGE; it rather arises from an emergent double-well potential felt by the spin excitations. This result shows that prethermalization occurs in a broader context than previously thought, and reveals new challenges for a generic understanding of the thermalization of quantum systems, particularly in the presence of long-range interactions.},

  abstract = {The Green's function method has applications in several fields in Physics, from classical differential equations to quantum many-body problems. In the quantum context, Green's functions are correlation functions, from which it is possible to extract information from the system under study, such as the density of states, relaxation times and response functions. Despite its power and versatility, it is known as a laborious and sometimes cumbersome method. Here we introduce the equilibrium Green's functions and the equation-of-motion technique, exemplifying the method in discrete lattices of non-interacting electrons. We start with simple models, such as the two-site molecule, the infinite and semi-infinite one-dimensional chains, and the two-dimensional ladder. Numerical implementations are developed via the recursive Green's function, implemented in Julia, an open-source, efficient and easy-to-learn scientific language. We also present a new variation of the surface recursive Green's function method, which can be of interest when simulating simultaneously the properties of surface and bulk.           ,              O m\'etodo das fun\c{c}\~oes de Green possui aplica\c{c}\~oes em diversos campos da F\'isica, desde equa\c{c}\~oes diferenciais cl\'assicas a problemas qu\^anticos de muitos corpos.

It is much debated which role thermal effects play and if the observed low-temperature behavior arises also at physiological temperatures. To contribute to this debate, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the coupling between the protein environment and the vertical excitation energies of individual bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the FMO complex of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum. The so-called spectral densities, which account for the environmental influence on the excited-state dynamics, are determined from temporal autocorrelation functions of the energy gaps between ground and first excited states of the individual pigments. Although the overall shape of the spectral density is found to be rather similar for all pigments, variations in their magnitude can be seen. Differences between the spectral densities for the pigments of the FMO monomer and FMO trimer are also presented.},

At the focus of the present study are the light-harvesting II complexes of the purple bacterium Rhodospirillum molischianum. The calculations are based on a time-dependent combination of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry methods. Using a 12 ps long trajectory, different quantum chemical methods have been compared to each other. Furthermore, several approaches to determine the couplings between the individual chromophores have been tested. Correlations between energy gap fluctuations of different individual pigments are analyzed but found to be negligible. From the energy gap fluctuations, spectral densities are extracted which serve as input for calculations of optical properties and exciton dynamics. To this end, the spectral densities are tested by determining the linear absorption of the complete two-ring system. One important difference from earlier studies is given by the severely extended length of the trajectory along which the quantum chemical calculations have been performed. Due to this extension, more accurate and reliable data have been obtained in the low frequency regime which is important in the dynamics of electronic relaxation.},

  abstract = {Matrix-product states have become the de facto standard for the representation of one-dimensional quantum many body states. During the last few years, numerous new methods have been introduced to evaluate the time evolution of a matrix-product state. Here, we will review and summarize the recent work on this topic as applied to finite quantum systems. We will explain and compare the different methods available to construct a time-evolved matrix-product state, namely the time-evolving block decimation, the MPO WI,II method, the global Krylov method, the local Krylov method and the one- and two-site time-dependent variational principle. We will also apply these methods to four different representative examples of current problem settings in condensed matter physics.},

A statistical background is necessary to quickly learn the analysis methods. What You Will Learn Understand the basic concepts of Time Series Analysis and appreciate its importance for the success of a data science project Develop an understanding of loading, exploring, and visualizing time-series data Explore auto-correlation and gain knowledge of statistical techniques to deal with non-stationarity time series Take advantage of exponential smoothing to tackle noise in time series data Learn how to use auto-regressive models to make predictions using time-series data Build predictive models on time series using techniques based on auto-regressive moving averages Discover recent advancements in deep learning to build accurate forecasting models for time series Gain familiarity with the basics of Python as a powerful yet simple to write programming language In Detail Time Series Analysis allows us to analyze data which is generated over a period of time and has sequential interdependencies between the observations. This book describes special mathematical tricks and techniques which are geared towards exploring the internal structures of time series data and generating powerful descriptive and predictive insights. Also, the book is full of real-life examples of time series and their analyses using cutting-edge solutions developed in Python. The book starts with descriptive analysis to create insightful visualizations of internal structures such as trend, seasonality and autocorrelation. Next, the statistical methods of dealing with autocorrelation and non-stationary time series are described. This is followed by exponential smoothing to produce meaningful insights from noisy time series data. At this point, we shift focus towards predictive analysis and introduce autoregressive models such as ARMA and ARIMA for time series forecasting. Later, powerful deep learning methods are presented, to develop accurate forecasting models for complex time series, and under the availability of litt ..},

The extended thawed Gaussian approximation is tested on electronic absorption spectra of the phenyl radical and benzene; calculated spectra reproduce experimental data and are much more accurate than standard global harmonic approaches, confirming the significance of anharmonicity. Moreover, the extended method provides a tool to quantify the Herzberg\textendash Teller contribution; we show that in the phenyl radical, anharmonicity outweighs the Herzberg\textendash Teller contribution, whereas in benzene, the Herzberg\textendash Teller contribution is essential because the transition is electronically forbidden and the Condon approximation yields a zero spectrum. Surprisingly, both adiabatic harmonic spectra outperform those of the vertical harmonic model, which describes the Franck\textendash Condon region better. Finally, we provide a simple recipe for orientationally averaging spectra, valid beyond the Condon approximation, and a relation among the transition dipole, its gradient, and nonadiabatic coupling vectors.},

We resolve the initial sequence of events comprising the fission of a singlet exciton in solids of pentacene derivatives using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. We propose a three-step model of singlet fission that includes two triplet-pair intermediates and show how transient spectroscopy can distinguish initially interacting triplet pairs from those that are spatially separated and noninteracting. We find that the interconversion of these two triplet-pair intermediates is limited by the rate of triplet transfer. These results clearly highlight the classical kinetic model of singlet fission and expose subtle details that promise to aid in resolving problems associated with triplet extraction.},

By using exact numerical and approximate analytical methods, we evaluate the free energy of this system at arbitrary interaction strengths and discuss strong-coupling modifications of derivative quantities such as the specific heat or the electric susceptibility. From this analysis we identify the lowest-order cavity-induced corrections to those quantities in the collective ultrastrong coupling regime and show that for even stronger interactions the presence of a single cavity mode can strongly modify extensive thermodynamic quantities of a large ensemble of dipoles. In this non-perturbative coupling regime we also observe a significant shift of the ferroelectric phase transition temperature and a characteristic broadening and collapse of the black-body spectrum of the cavity mode. Apart from a purely fundamental interest, these general insights will be important for identifying potential applications of ultrastrong-coupling effects, for example, in the field of quantum chemistry or for realizing quantum thermal machines.},

Besides these static properties, the dissipative dynamics of the two models is systematically investigated using Redfield relaxation theory. In case of the vibronic dimer this allows to treat selected vibrational degrees of freedom beyond the limits of perturbation theory and Markov approximation.

However, one area that has remained largely unexplored is the space of novel programming languages that can provide unique benefits to quantum chemistry software development. One such programming language is Julia, an interpreted language designed to achieve the performance of high-performance, statically compiled languages. To assess the viability of Julia, the restricted Hartree\textendash Fock method was implemented in a new quantum chemistry software package, JuliaChem. JuliaChem is a novel quantum chemistry software designed to take advantage of Julia as much as possible while achieving runtimes comparable to that of more established quantum chemistry software packages. Performance benchmarks against the popular quantum chemistry software package GAMESS, using the S22 test set of molecules, indicate that JuliaChem displays performance that is competitive with that of GAMESS. This shows that Julia could be a potentially useful tool for the field of electronic structure theory.},

  abstract = {In recent years, parallelism via multithreading has become extremely important to the optimization of high-performance electronic structure theory codes. Such multithreading is generally achieved via OpenMP constructs, using a fork-join threading model to enable thread-level data parallelism within the code. An alternative approach to multithreading is task-based parallelism, which displays multiple benefits relative to fork-join thread parallelism. A novel Restricted Hartree\textendash Fock (RHF) algorithm, utilizing task-based parallelism to achieve optimal performance, was developed and implemented into the JuliaChem electronic structure theory software package. The new RHF algorithm utilizes a unique method of shell quartet batch creation, enabling construction and distribution of fine-grained shell quartet batches in a load-balanced manner using the Julia task construct. These shell quartet batches are then distributed statically across message-passing interface (MPI) ranks and dynamically across threads within an MPI rank, requiring no explicit inter-rank or interthread synchronization to do so. Compared to the hybrid MPI/OpenMP RHF algorithm present in the GAMESS software package, the task-based algorithm demonstrates speedups of up to {$\sim$}40\% for systems in the S22(3) test set of molecules, with system sizes up to {$\sim$}1000 basis functions. The JuliaChem algorithm demonstrates the viability of both the task-based parallelism model and the Julia programming language for construction of performant electronic structure theory codes targeting systems of a size of chemical interest.},

  abstract = {To determine the dynamics of a molecular aggregate under the influence of a strongly time-dependent perturbation within a dissipative environment is still, in general, a challenge. The time-dependent perturbation might be, for example, due to external fields or explicitly treated fluctuations within the environment. Methods to calculate the dynamics in these cases do exist though some of these approaches assume that the corresponding correlation functions can be written as a weighted sum of exponentials. One such theory is the hierarchical equations of motion approach. If the environment, however, is described by a complex spectral density or if its temperature is low, these approaches become very inefficient. Therefore, we propose a scheme based on a Chebyshev decomposition of the bath correlation functions and detail the respective quantum master equations within second-order perturbation theory in the environmental coupling. Similar approaches have recently been proposed for systems coupled to Fermionic reservoirs. The proposed scheme is tested for a simple two-level system and compared to existing results. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the present Chebyshev approach are discussed.},

This approach is applied to the paradigmatic spin-boson model in order to calculate the mean and fluctuations of the heat transferred to the environment during thermal equilibration. We show that system-reservoir correlations make a significant contribution to the heat statistics at low temperature and present a variational theory that quantitatively explains our numerical results. We also demonstrate a fluctuation-dissipation relation connecting the mean and variance of the heat distribution at high temperature. Our results reveal that system-bath interactions make a significant contribution to heat transfer even when the dynamics of the open system is effectively Markovian. The method presented here provides a flexible and general tool to predict the fluctuations of heat transfer in open quantum systems in nonperturbative regimes.},

The complex is a part of the light-harvesting system of green photosynthetic bacteria. Its lowest-energy absorption band, peaking at 826nm and responsible for the fluorescence, is believed to be due to Qy transitions of largely isolated molecules. One of the main merits of the used method compared with the more common fluorescence line narrowing is that the zero-phonon lines (ZPL) resonant with the excitation laser can be accurately measured, allowing precise determination of the Huang\textendash Rhys (HR) factors, the main characteristics of the linear electron\textendash phonon and vibronic coupling strengths. Over 60 individual vibrational modes of intra- and intermolecular origin have been resolved in the energy range of 45\textendash 1600cm-1. The small HR factors for these modes, ranging between 0.001 and 0.018, add up to a value of Svib=0.38{$\pm$}0.07. The effective HR factor for the phonons, Sph, was found clearly wavelength-dependent, varying from {$\sim$}0.7 at short wavelengths to {$\sim$}0.3 at the long-wavelength tail of the absorption spectrum. Coupling between the BChl a molecules is likely responsible for this wavelength dependence.},

The method is applied to the Fenna\textendash Matthews\textendash Olson (FMO) protein in order to investigate the influence of the different parts of the spectral density as well as correlations among these contributions on the energy transfer dynamics and on the temperature-dependent decay of coherences. The fluctuations and correlations in excitonic couplings as well as the correlations between coupling and site energy fluctuations are found to be 1 order of magnitude smaller in amplitude than the site energy fluctuations. Despite considerable amplitudes of that part of the spectral density which contains correlations in site energy fluctuations, the effect of these correlations on the exciton population dynamics and dephasing of coherences is negligible. The inhomogeneous charge distribution of the protein, which causes variations in local pigment\textendash protein coupling constants of the normal modes, is responsible for this effect. It is seen thereby that the same building principle that is used by nature to create an excitation energy funnel in the FMO protein also allows for efficient dissipation of the excitons' excess energy.},

The second part provides a discussion of the standard F\"orster and Redfield theories of excitation energy transfer, which are valid in the limit of weak and strong pigment\textendash pigment coupling, respectively. Afterward, we provide a description of recent extensions of the standard theories and discuss challenging problems to be solved in the future.},

We demonstrate the power of the method by calculations on several molecular aggregate models, comparing our results against those from multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree and n-particle approximations.

A discussion of how best to consistently process the chromophore excitation energy fluctuation correlation functions calculated in these classical simulations to obtain reliable site-dependent spectral densities is presented. The calculations reveal that chromophores that are close to the protein\textendash water interface can experience strongly dissipative environmental interactions characterized by reorganization energies that can be as much as 2\textendash 3 times those of chromophores that are buried deep in the hydrophobic protein scaffolding. Using a linearized density matrix quantum propagation method, we demonstrate that the inhomogeneous system\textendash bath model obtained from our site-dependent spectral density calculations gives results consistent with experimental dissipation and dephasing rates. Moreover, we show that this model can simultaneously enhance the energy-transfer rate and extend the decoherence time. Finally, we explore the influence of initially exciting different chromophores and mutating local environments on energy transfer through the network. These studies suggest that different pathways, selected by varying initial photoexcitation, can exhibit significantly different relaxation times depending on whether the energy-transfer path involves chromophores at the protein\textendash solvent interface or if all chromophores in the pathway are buried in the protein.},

  abstract = {Understanding how the complex interplay among excitonic interactions, vibronic couplings, and reorganization energy determines coherence-enabled transport mechanisms is a grand challenge with both foundational implications and potential payoffs for energy science. We use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to show how a modest change in structure may be used to modify the exciton delocalization, tune electronic and vibrational coherences, and alter the mechanism of exciton transfer in covalently linked cofacial Zn-porphyrin dimers (mesobeta linked ABm-{$\beta$} and meso-meso linked AAm-m). While both ABm-{$\beta$} and AAm-m feature zinc porphyrins linked by a 1,2-phenylene bridge, differences in the interporphyrin connectivity set the lateral shift between macrocycles, reducing electronic coupling in ABm-{$\beta$} and resulting in a localized exciton. Pump-probe experiments show that the exciton dynamics is faster by almost an order of magnitude in the strongly coupled AAm-m dimer, and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) identifies a vibronic coherence that is absent in ABm-{$\beta$}. Theoretical studies indicate how the interchromophore interactions in these structures, and their system-bath couplings, influence excitonic delocalization and vibronic coherence-enabled rapid exciton transport dynamics. Realtime path integral calculations reproduce the exciton transfer kinetics observed experimentally and find that the linking-modulated exciton delocalization strongly enhances the contribution of vibronic coherences to the exciton transfer mechanism, and that this coherence accelerates the exciton transfer dynamics. These benchmark molecular design, 2DES, and theoretical studies provide a foundation for directed explorations of nonclassical effects on exciton dynamics in multiporphyrin assemblies.},

Herein, we explore the bound triplet pair, m(T1T1), an important intermediate state in singlet fission. We highlight a growing number of studies~indicating there is an energetic stabilization of triplet-pair states relative to free triplets. This stabilization enables endothermic singlet fission processes and often results in long lifetimes of the bound triplet-pair state. However, triplets in close proximity demonstrate heightened recombination and reduced excited-state lifetimes. The ubiquity of bound triplet-pair states in recent reports indicates the importance of this state, the need to discern it from free triplets, and the usefulness of having carefully tuned interactions between triplets produced by singlet fission.},

The new method is suitable for various classes of problems, including problems with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, nonlinear problems, non-Hermitian problems and problems with an inhomogeneous source term. In this paper, a thorough presentation of the basic principles of the propagator is given. We give also a special emphasis on the details of the numerical implementation of the method. For the first time, we present the application for a non-Hermitian problem by a numerical example of a one-dimensional atom under the influence of an intense laser field. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by a comparison with the common Runge\textendash Kutta approach.},

This massive amount of raw data needs to be stored and interpreted in order to advance the materials science field. Identifying correlations and patterns from large amounts of complex data is being performed by machine learning algorithms for decades. Recently, the materials science community started to invest in these methodologies to extract knowledge and insights from the accumulated data. This review follows a logical sequence starting from density functional theory as the representative instance of electronic structure methods, to the subsequent high-throughput approach, used to generate large amounts of data. Ultimately, data-driven strategies which include data mining, screening, and machine learning techniques, employ the data generated. We show how these approaches to modern computational materials science are being used to uncover complexities and design novel materials with enhanced properties. Finally, we point to the present research problems, challenges, and potential future perspectives of this new exciting field.},

Its applications to the calculation of static, dynamic, and thermodynamic quantities in these systems are reviewed here. The potential of DMRG applications in the fields of two-dimensional quantum systems, quantum chemistry, three-dimensional small grains, nuclear physics, equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics, and time-dependent phenomena is also discussed.

  abstract = {The influence of exciton\textendash vibrational coupling on the optical and transport properties of molecular aggregates is an old problem that gained renewed interest in recent years. On the experimental side, various nonlinear spectroscopic techniques gave insight into the dynamics of systems as complex as photosynthetic antennae. Striking evidence was gathered that in these protein\textendash pigment complexes quantum coherence is operative even at room temperature conditions. Investigations were triggered to understand the role of vibrational degrees of freedom, beyond that of a heat bath characterized by thermal fluctuations. This development was paralleled by theory, where efficient methods emerged, which could provide the proper frame to perform non-Markovian and non-perturbative simulations of exciton\textendash vibrational dynamics and spectroscopy. This review summarizes the state of affairs of the theory of exciton\textendash vibrational interaction in molecular aggregates and photosynthetic antenna complexes. The focus is put on the discussion of basic effects of exciton\textendash vibrational interaction from the stationary and dynamics points of view. Here, the molecular dimer plays a prominent role as it permits a systematic investigation of absorption and emission spectra by numerical diagonalization of the exciton\textendash vibrational Hamiltonian in a truncated Hilbert space. An extension to larger aggregates, having many coupled nuclear degrees of freedom, becomes possible with the Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method for wave packet propagation. In fact it will be shown that this method allows one to approach the limit of almost continuous spectral densities, which is usually the realm of density matrix theory. Real system\textendash bath situations are introduced for two models, which differ in the way strongly coupled nuclear coordinates are treated, as a part of the relevant system or the bath. A rather detailed exposition of the Hierarchy Equations Of Motion (HEOM) method will be given in terms of a stochastic decoupling ansatz. This method has become the standard in exciton\textendash vibrational theory and illustrative examples will be presented as well as a comparison with ML-MCTDH. Applications will be shown for generic model systems as well as for small aggregates mimicking those formed by perylene bisimide dyes. Further, photosynthetic antenna complexes will be discussed, including spectral densities and the role of exciton\textendash vibrational coupling in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy.},

The theoretical approach combines aspects of the linear vibronic coupling and Frenkel exciton models. Dynamics calculations are performed for the absorption spectrum and the electronic state populations using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree approach. As an application, perylene bisimde J-type dimer and trimer aggregates are considered, including four tuning and one coupling mode per monomer. This leads to a dynamical model comprising up to 7 electronic states and 15 vibrational modes. The unknown nonadiabatic coupling strength is treated as a parameter that is chosen in accordance with available absorption spectra. This leaves some flexibility that can be limited by the clearly distinguishable population dynamics.},

Since finite decorrelation times may arise either from temperature or from a voltage drop at zero temperature, the approach is well suited for the description of the real-time dynamics of single-molecule devices and quantum dots driven to a steady state via interaction with two or more electron leads. We numerically investigate two nontrivial models: the evolution of the nonequilibrium population of a two-level system coupled to two electronic reservoirs, and quantum transport in the nonequilibrium Anderson model. For the latter case, two distinct formulations are described. Results are compared to those obtained by other techniques.},

In this article we describe for the first time how PT becomes applicable in the framework of the ``Hierarchical Equations of Motion'' (HEOM) approach for treatment of open quantum systems. We extend the concept of formulating operators in HEOM space by deriving hierarchical equations of PT which lead to a shift in the excited state potential energy surface to compensate its displacement. While the assumption of thermal equilibration of the vibrational oscillators, introduced by PT, results in a stationary state in a monomer, in a dimer under the same assumption nonequilibrium dynamics appears because of the interplay of the transfer process and vibrational equilibration. Both vertical transitions generating a vibrationally hot state and initially equilibrated vibrational oscillators evolve toward the same stationary asymptotic state associated with polaron formation. The effect of PT on the dynamics of this process depends on initial excitation and basis representation of the electronic system. The developed approach facilitates a generic formulation of quantum master equations involving perturbative treatment of polaron dynamics.},

In comparison with the standard formulation of HEOM, our equations contain additional connections between ADOs in the hierarchy scheme, which account for the dependence of the nonadiabatic coupling elements on the vibrational coordinates. We compare absorption spectra calculated with our HEOM methodology and with explicit treatment of vibrational DOF for a dimer system in the strong resonance coupling regime.

The energy conversion efficiency of ATP synthesis at illuminations corresponding to 1\%\textendash 5\% of full sunlight is calculated to be 0.12\textendash 0.04, respectively. The vesicle stoichiometry, evolutionarily adapted to the low light intensities in the habitat of purple bacteria, is suboptimal for steady-state ATP turnover for the benefit of protection against over-illumination.                        ,              Photosynthesis, or the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, is a process that powers almost all life on Earth. Plants and certain bacteria share similar processes to perform photosynthesis, though the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides uses a photosynthetic system that is much less complex than that in plants. Light harvesting inside the bacterium takes place in up to hundreds of compartments called chromatophores. Each chromatophore in turn contains hundreds of cooperating proteins that together absorb the energy of sunlight and convert and store it in molecules of ATP, the universal energy currency of all cells.             The chromatophore of primitive purple bacteria provides a model for more complex photosynthetic systems in plants. Though researchers had characterized its individual components over the years, less was known about the overall architecture of the chromatophore and how its many components work together to harvest light energy efficiently and robustly. This knowledge would provide insight into the evolutionary pressures that shaped the chromatophore and its ability to work efficiently at different light intensities.             Sener et al. now present a highly detailed structural model of the chromatophore of purple bacteria based on the findings of earlier studies. The model features the position of every atom of the constituent proteins and is used to examine how energy is transferred and converted. Sener et al. describe the sequence of energy conversion steps and calculate the overall energy conversion efficiency, namely how much of the light energy arriving at the microorganism is stored as ATP.             These calculations show that the chromatophore is optimized to produce chemical energy at low light levels typical of purple bacterial habitats, and dissipate excess energy to avoid being damaged under brighter light. The chromatophore's architecture also displays robustness against perturbations of its components. In the future, the approach used by Sener et al. to describe light harvesting in this bacterial compartment can be applied to more complex systems, such as those in plants.},

Herein, we investigate three physically justified forms of single-parameter, energy-gap dependent regularization which can yield high and transferable accuracy for a variety of noncovalent interactions (including S22, S66, and L7 test sets) and (mostly closed shell) transition metal thermochemistry. Regularization serves to damp overestimated pairwise additive contributions, renormalizing first-order amplitudes such that the effects of higher-order correlations are incorporated. The optimal parameter values for the noncovalent and transition metal sets are 1.1, 0.7, and 0.4 for {$\kappa$}, {$\sigma$}, and {$\sigma$}2 regularizers, respectively. However, such regularization slightly degrades the accuracy of conventional MP2 for some small-molecule test sets, most of which have relatively large average frontier energy gaps. Our results suggest that appropriately regularized MP2 models may improve double hybrid density functionals, at no additional cost over conventional MP2.},

Although successful in many respects, several widely used descriptions only include an effective treatment of the protein-chromophore interactions. In this work, by combining an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, time-dependent density functional theory, and open quantum system approaches, we successfully simulate the dynamics of the electronic energy transfer of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson pigment-protein complex. The resulting characteristic beating of populations and quantum coherences is in good agreement with the experimental results and the hierarchy equation of motion approach. The experimental absorption, linear, and circular dichroism spectra and dephasing rates are recovered at two different temperatures. In addition, we provide an extension of our method to include zero-point fluctuations of the vibrational environment. This work thus presents, to our knowledge, one of the first steps to explain the role of excitonic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes based on their atomistic and molecular description.},

  abstract = {We have studied scattering states and thermodynamic properties of electron\textendash hole systems. Starting from the constituent electrons and holes and Coulomb interactions, we have used quantum Monte Carlo simulation techniques to sample properties of wavefunctions and thermal density matrices. We have studied three types of systems: (1) the scattering of two excitons, with full-quantum treatment of the four constituent particles, (2) the thermodynamic equilibrium of 14 electron\textendash hole pairs having two spin states for each particle, which form excitons and biexcitons at low temperatures, and (3) the thermodynamic equilibrium of 27 spin-polarized electron\textendash hole pairs, which form a dilute exciton gas that undergoes Bose condensation at low temperatures. We compare our results with predictions of the Saha equation for exciton and biexciton formation, and Bogoliubov theory for the energy of the dilute Bose gas of excitons. We also discuss the outlook for future quantum Monte Carlo simulations on these systems.},

  abstract = {Electronic excitations in small aggregates, thin films, and crystals of conjugated organic molecules play a fundamental role in the operation of a wide array of organic-based devices including solar cells, transistors, and light-emitting diodes. Such excitations, or excitons, are generally spread out over several molecules: a balance between the delocalizing influence of resonant intermolecular coupling and the localizing influence of static and dynamic disorder determines the coherence range of the exciton. Because of the ``soft'' nature of organic materials, significant nuclear relaxation in the participating molecules also accompanies the electronic excitations. To properly understand energy or charge transport, one must treat intermolecular (excitonic) coupling, electron-vibrational coupling, and disorder on equal footing. In this Account, we review the key elements of a theoretical approach based on a multiparticle representation that describes electronic excitations in organic materials as vibronic excitations surrounded by a field of vibrational excitations. Such composite excitations are appropriately called Frenkel excitonic polarons. For many conjugated molecules, the bulk of the nuclear reorganization energy following electronic excitation arises from the elongation of a symmetric vinyl stretching mode with energy {$\sim$}1400 cm-1. To appreciate the impact of aggregation, we study how the vibronic progression of this mode, which dominates the isolated (solvated) molecule absorption and emission spectra, is distorted when molecules are close enough to interact with each other. As we demonstrate in this Account, the nature of the distortion provides a wealth of information about how the molecules are packed, the strength of the excitonic interactions between molecules, the number of molecules that are coherently coupled, and the nature of the disorder. We show that the aggregation-induced deviations from the Poissonian distribution of vibronic peak intensities take on two extremes identified with ideal H- and J-aggregates. The sign of the nearest neighbor electronic coupling, positive for H and negative for J, distinguishes the two basic aggregate forms. For several decades, researchers have known that H-aggregates exhibit blue-shifted absorption spectra and are subradiant while J-aggregates exhibit the opposite behavior (red-shifted absorption and superradiance). However, the exact inclusion of exciton-vibrational coupling reveals several more distinguishing traits between the two aggregate types: in H(J)-aggregates the ratio of the first two vibronic peak intensities in the absorption spectrum decreases (increases) with increasing excitonic coupling, while the ratio of the 0-0 to 0-1 emission intensities increases (decreases) with disorder and increases (decreases) with increasing temperature. These two extreme behaviors provide the framework for understanding absorption and emission in more complex morphologies, such as herringbone packing in oligo(phenylene vinylene)s, oligothiophenes and polyacene crystals, as well as the polymorphic packing arrangements observed in carotenoids.},

  abstract = {In quantum field theory, bare particles are dressed by a cloud of virtual particles to form physical particles. The virtual particles affect properties such as the mass and charge of the physical particles, and it is only these modified properties that can be measured in experiments, not the properties of the bare particles. The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the ultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has recently been realised in several condensed-matter systems. In some of these systems, the effective interaction between atom-like transitions and the cavity photons can be switched on or off by external control pulses. This offers unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the relation between physical and bare particles. We consider a single three-level quantum system coupled to an optical resonator. Here we show that, by applying external electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity-QED systems can be converted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this way, the hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations can be unravelled and becomes experimentally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons can be clearly pictured using Feynman diagrams with cut loops.},

Detailed implementation of each step of the method is presented, along with efficient algorithms for working with matrix product states and matrix product operators. Furthermore, we explore how the properties of METTS can reveal characteristic order and excitations of systems and discuss why METTS form an efficient basis for sampling. Finally, we explore the extent to which the average entanglement of a METTS ensemble is minimal.},

To date, most understanding of open quantum systems is restricted either to weak system\textendash bath couplings or to special cases where specific numerical techniques become effective. Here we present a general and yet exact numerical approach that efficiently describes the time evolution of a quantum system coupled to a non-Markovian harmonic environment. Our method relies on expressing the system state and its propagator as a matrix product state and operator, respectively, and using a singular value decomposition to compress the description of the state as time evolves. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our approach by numerically identifying the localisation transition of the Ohmic spin-boson model, and considering a model with widely separated environmental timescales arising for a pair of spins embedded in a common environment.},

With the advent of supercomputers containing large amounts of memory and many processors, the computational challenge posed by the previously intractable theoretical models can now be addressed. The hierarchy equations of motion present one such model and offer a powerful method that has remained underutilized so far, because of its considerable computational expense. By exploiting concurrent processing on parallel computers, the hierarchy equations of motion can be applied to biological-scale systems. Herein, we introduce the quantum dynamics software PHI that solves the hierarchical equations of motion. We describe the integrator employed by PHI and demonstrate PHI's scaling and efficiency running on large parallel computers by applying the software to the calculation of intercomplex excitation transfer between the light-harvesting complexes 1 (LH1) and 2 (LH2) of purple photosynthetic bacteria, which involves a 50-pigment system.},

The library is able to evaluate arbitrary integral expressions on top of p, r and {$\sigma$} operators with one-electron overlap and nuclear attraction, two-electron Coulomb and Gaunt operators for segmented contracted and/or generated contracted basis in Cartesian, spherical or spinor form. Using a symbolic algebra tool, new integrals are derived and translated to C code programmatically. The generated integrals can be used in various types of molecular properties. To demonstrate the capability of the integral library, we computed the analytical gradients and NMR shielding constants at both nonrelativistic and 4-component relativistic Hartree?Fock level in this work. Due to the use of kinetically balanced basis and gauge including atomic orbitals, the relativistic analytical gradients and shielding constants requires the integral library to handle the fifth-order electron repulsion integral derivatives. The generality of the integral library is achieved without losing efficiency. On the modern multi-CPU platform, Libcint can easily reach the overall throughput being many times of the I/O bandwidth. On a 20-core node, we are able to achieve an average output 8.3 GB/s for C60 molecule with cc-pVTZ basis. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The package provides a wide range of tools to support simulations of finite-size systems, extended systems with periodic boundary conditions, low-dimensional periodic systems, and custom Hamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis functions. To ensure ease of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all of its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran-based quantum chemistry programs.

It begins with the molecular nature of matter and the fact that we want to describe systems containing many (1020) particles. The first part of the book derives the entropy of the classical ideal gas using only classical statistical mechanics and Boltzmann's analysis of multiple systems. The properties of this entropy are then expressed as postulates of thermodynamics in the second part of the book. From these postulates, the structure of thermodynamics is developed. Special features are systematic methods for deriving thermodynamic identities using Jacobians, the use of Legendre transforms as a basis for thermodynamic potentials, the introduction of Massieu functions to investigate negative temperatures, and an analysis of the consequences of the Nernst postulate. The third part of the book introduces the canonical and grand canonical ensembles, which are shown to facilitate calculations for many models. An explanation of irreversible phenomena that is consistent with time-reversal invariance in a closed system is presented. The fourth part of the book is devoted to quantum statistical mechanics, including black-body radiation, the harmonic solid, Bose\textendash Einstein and Fermi\textendash Dirac statistics, and an introduction to band theory, including metals, insulators, and semiconductors. The final chapter gives a brief introduction to the theory of phase transitions. Throughout the book, there is a strong emphasis on computational methods to make abstract concepts more concrete.},

The dominant method for the synthesis of chlorins has entailed the derivatization of porphyrins. The present review covers the ostensibly simple conversion of porphyrins, regardless of synthetic or biological origin, to chlorins. The period covered encompasses the entire history since the beginnings of chlorin synthetic chemistry in the early 20th century through 2015. Representative transformations include hydrogenation, cycloaddition, annulation, and diverse ``breaking and mending'' approaches. Altogether, the synthesis of \textbackslash textgreater1000 chlorins or chlorin-like compounds (containing \textbackslash textgreater50 distinct pyrroline motifs) is described.

Ishizaki and Fleming further developed a hierarchy equation approach to describe this excitation population transfer dynamics in a model photosynthetic system. Here, we treat this same model system via the linearized approximation to the semiclassical (SC) initial value representation (IVR) for time correlation functions, in combination with the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss model for the electronic degrees of freedom. Our approach is able to describe the long-lived quantum coherent dynamics, in excellent agreement with Ishizaki-Fleming's results. Moreover, the advantage of the linearlized SC-IVR approach is that it can be applied to any molecular model for which classical MD simulations are feasible, all the way up to a full all-atom MD simulation, while at the same time treating the electronic and nuclear dynamics in a consistent fashion.},

The key idea in this TD-SC-IVR method is to perform importance sampling of trajectories for the MC averages in the SC calculations with a sampling function that includes information about the final (time-evolved) values of the coordinates and momenta of trajectories in addition to (the usual) information of their initial values. This paper shows how this approach deals with electronically non-adiabatic dynamics, i.e. dynamics that involves coupled multiple electronic states. We suggest that a state-resolved sampling function may facilitate the efficient implementation of TD-SC-IVR for such processes. This is illustrated by application to the calculation of the nuclear momentum distribution function (i.e. the nuclear energy-loss spectrum) for a benchmark non-adiabatic scattering problem.},

The truncation, filtering, and ?update list? schemes, as well as OpenMP parallelization, allow for further computational saving. The package is written in a mix of C++ and Python languages, delivering the best compromise between user friendliness and efficiency. The Python layer of the package takes advantage of standard Python libraries, such as h5py, which allows efficient storage and retrieval of the generated results. The package can be seamlessly used within Jupyter notebooks; its careful design shall provide the maximal convenience and intuitiveness to its users.},

These were assigned to superpositions of excitonic states, a controversial interpretation, as the strong chromophore\textendash environment interactions in the complex suggest fast dephasing. Although it has been pointed out that vibrational motion produces similar spectral signatures, a concrete assignment of these oscillatory signals to distinct physical processes is still lacking. Here we revisit the coherence dynamics of the FMO complex using polarization-controlled two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, supported by theoretical modelling. We show that the long-lived QBs are exclusively vibrational in origin, whereas the dephasing of the electronic coherences is completed within 240 fs even at 77 K. We further find that specific vibrational coherences are produced via vibronically coupled excited states. The presence of such states suggests that vibronic coupling is relevant for photosynthetic energy transfer.},

The calculations are performed using the quasiadiabatic propagator path integral (QUAPI) methodology to evaluate the flux\textendash flux correlation function whose time integral determines the rate coefficient. The discretized path integral converges very rapidly in the QUAPI representation, allowing efficient calculation of quantum correlation functions for sufficiently long times. No ad hoc assumption is introduced and thus these calculations yield the true quantum mechanical rate constants. The results presented in the paper demonstrate the applicability of the QUAPI methodology to practically all regimes of chemical interest, from thermal activation to deep tunneling, and the quantum transmission factor exhibits a Kramers turnover. Our calculations reveal an unusual step structure of the integrated reactive flux in the weak friction regime as well as quantum dynamical enhancement of the rate above the quantum transition state theory value at low temperatures, which is largely due to vibrational coherence effects. The quantum rates are compared to those obtained from classical trajectory simulations. We also use the numerically exact classical and quantum results to establish the degree of accuracy of several analytic and numerical approximations, including classical and quantum Grote\textendash Hynes theories, semiclassical transition state theory (periodic orbit) estimates, classical and quantum turnover theories, and the centroid density approximation.},

To study quantum non-Markovian system-bath dynamics numerically rigorously and nonperturbatively, we developed a computer code for the reduced hierarchy equations of motion (HEOM) for a graphics processor unit (GPU) that can treat the system as large as 4096 energy states. The code employs a Pad\'e spectrum decomposition (PSD) for a construction of HEOM and the exponential integrators. Dynamics of a quantum spin glass system are studied by calculating the free induction decay signal for the cases of 3 \texttimes{} 2 to 3 \texttimes{} 4 triangular lattices with antiferromagnetic interactions. We found that spins relax faster at lower temperature due to transitions through a quantum coherent state, as represented by the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix, while it has been known that the spins relax slower due to suppression of thermal activation in a classical case. The decay of the spins are qualitatively similar regardless of the lattice sizes. The pathway of spin relaxation is analyzed under a sudden temperature drop condition. The Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) based source code used in the present calculations is provided as Supporting Information.},

Since condensed matter physics deals with those phenomena in which a system of quanta exist together with a variety of macroscopic objects at finite temperature, it may be said to manifest the fundamental properties of quantum field theory in its widest sense. Thus condensed matter physics has served as a powerful motivating force throughout the growth and development of quantum field theory. This process was indeed initiated by the celebrated Matsubara formalism of finite temperature Green's function method. This process is by no means complete since recent developments in many areas of physics demand a more sophisticated understanding with regard to the fundamental nature of quantum field theory.A brief description of this maturing process of quantum field theory in the past, present and prospects for the future will be the main content of this article.},

As the tunneling spectra are highly sensitive to both the details of the quantum dynamics and the potential energy surface, our calculations are a validation of the MB-Pol surface as well as the accuracy of PIMD. The favorable scaling of PIMD with system size paves the way for calculations of tunneling splittings in large, nonrigid molecular systems with motions that cannot be treated accurately by other methods, such as the semiclassical instanton.},

  abstract = {Abstract The widely used CHARMM additive all-atom force field includes parameters for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. In the present article, an extension of the CHARMM force field to drug-like molecules is presented. The resulting CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) covers a wide range of chemical groups present in biomolecules and drug-like molecules, including a large number of heterocyclic scaffolds. The parametrization philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field. CGenFF thus makes it possible to perform ``all-CHARMM'' simulations on drug-target interactions thereby extending the utility of CHARMM force fields to medicinally relevant systems. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Numerical simulations with the ground state of a 1D lattice at criticality show that the resulting coarse-grained sites require a Hilbert space dimension that does not grow with successive RG transformations. As a result we can address, in a quasi-exact way, tens of thousands of quantum spins with a computational effort that scales logarithmically in the system's size. The calculations unveil that ground state entanglement in extended quantum systems is organized in layers corresponding to different length scales. At a quantum critical point, each relevant length scale makes an equivalent contribution to the entanglement of a block.},

We briefly review the various applications of the XF idea in different realms, and how features of these potentials aid in the interpretation of two different laser-driven dissociation mechanisms. We present a detailed study of the different ways the coupling terms in recently-developed XF-based mixed quantum-classical approximations are evaluated, where either truly coupled trajectories, or auxiliary trajectories that mimic the coupling are used, and discuss their effect in both a surface-hopping framework as well as the rigorously-derived coupled-trajectory mixed quantum-classical approach.},

We argue that the choice of the (single) trajectory branch during the time preceding the memory interval can significantly affect the memory length required for convergence. At short times, the trajectory branch associated with the reactant state improves convergence by eliminating spurious memory. We also introduce an instantaneous population-based probabilistic scheme which introduces state-to-state hops in the retained pre-memory trajectory branch, and which is designed to choose primarily the trajectory branch associated with the reactant at early times, but to favor the product state more as the reaction progresses to completion. Test calculations show that the dynamically consistent state hopping scheme leads to accelerated convergence and a dramatic reduction of computational effort.},

Here we describe DeePMD-kit, a package written in Python/C++ that has been designed to minimize the effort required to build deep learning based representation of potential energy and force field and to perform molecular dynamics. Potential applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems. DeePMD-kit is interfaced with TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, making the training process highly automatic and efficient. On the other end, DeePMD-kit is interfaced with high-performance classical molecular dynamics and quantum (path-integral) molecular dynamics packages, i.e., LAMMPS and the i-PI, respectively. Thus, upon training, the potential energy and force field models can be used to perform efficient molecular simulations for different purposes. As an example of the many potential applications of the package, we use DeePMD-kit to learn the interatomic potential energy and forces of a water model using data obtained from density functional theory. We demonstrate that the resulted molecular dynamics model reproduces accurately the structural information contained in the original model.

For decades this singularity had been numerically removed by regularizing the reduced density matrix. In this Perspective we discuss our recent proposal to regularize the coefficient tensor instead, which has significant impact on both the efficiency and correctness of the EOMs in MCTDH and ML-MCTDH for challenging problems. We further demonstrate that when the system becomes large such that it is necessary to use ML-MCTDH with many layers, it is much more important to employ this new regularization scheme. We illustrate this point by studying a spin\textendash boson model with a large bath that contains up to 100\,000 modes. We show that even in the weak coupling regime the new regularization scheme is required to quickly rotate the virtual orbitals into the correct directions in Hilbert space. We argue that this situation can be common for applying a time-dependent tensor network approach to any large enough system.},

The Dirac\textendash Frenkel variational principle is then applied to optimally determine the equations of motion. Following this strategy, the SP groups are built in several layers, where each top layer SP can contain many more Cartesian degrees of freedom than in the previous formulation of the MCTDH method. As a result, the ML-MCTDH method has the capability of treating substantially more physical degrees of freedom than the original MCTDH method, and thus significantly enhances the ability of carrying out quantum dynamical simulations for complex molecular systems.

  abstract = {This review deals with the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method applied to the problems of energy transport due to atomic vibrations (phonons), primarily for small junction systems. We present a pedagogical introduction to the subject, deriving some of the well-known results such as the Laudauer-like formula for heat current in ballistic systems. The main aim of the review is to build the machinery of the method so that it can be applied to other situations, which are not directly treated here. In addition to the above, we consider a number of applications of NEGF, not in routine model system calculations, but in a few new aspects showing the power and usefulness of the formalism. In particular, we discuss the problems of multiple leads, coupled left-right-lead system, and system without a center. We also apply the method to the problem of full counting statistics. In the case of nonlinear systems, we make general comments on the thermal expansion effect, phonon relaxation time, and a certain class of mean-field approximations. Lastly, we examine the relationship between NEGF, reduced density matrix, and master equation approaches to thermal transport.},

While full QCPI calculations have been shown to be feasible on parallel computing platforms, the large number of trajectory calculations required leads to computational cost that significantly exceeds that of classical molecular dynamics calculations. This paper describes the harmonic back-reaction (HBR) approximation to the QCPI expression, which reduces dramatically the computational cost by requiring a single classical trajectory from each initial condition. Test calculations on a model of strongly anharmonic oscillators show that the HBR treatment quantitatively reproduces the full QCPI results. The HBR-QCPI algorithm is applicable to a variety of condensed phase and biological systems with effort only somewhat greater than that of molecular dynamics simulations.},

Herein, we systematically investigate the crystalline state vibrationally resolved absorption and emission spectra for a series of AIEgens and non-AIEgens by considering intermolecular excited state interaction by using Frenkel-exciton model coupled with quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. It is found that the competition between the intramolecular vibronic coupling ({$\lambda$}) and the intermolecular exciton coupling (J) governs the crystalline aggregate spectral characters. At room temperature, when J/{$\lambda$} value is larger than a critical value (ca. 0.17), the exciton coupling would have a large effect on the optical spectra. For face-to-face H-aggregates, only when both intermolecular electrostatic and excitonic couplings are considered, can one obtain calculated vibrationally resolved spectra and well reproduce the experimental results, namely, remarkable blue-shift in absorption but much less red-shift in emission when compared with the gas-phase. The optical spectra of the AIE-active aggregates are determined by the intramolecular vibronic coupling because the ratio J/{$\lambda$} is less than the critical value.},

We then show where our exact 7-site results deviate from the approximation of Ishizaki and Fleming [A. Ishizaki and G. R. Fleming, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 2009, 106, 17255]. Our exact results are then compared to calculations using the incoherent F\"orster theory, and it is found that the time scale of energy transfer is roughly the same, regardless of whether or not coherence is considered. This means that coherence is not likely to improve the efficiency of the transfer. In fact, the incoherent theory often tends to overpredict the rates of energy transfer, suggesting that, in some cases, quantum coherence may actually slow the photosynthetic process.},

  abstract = {Femtosecond transient grating and photon echo spectroscopies with a sub-20 fs time resolution are applied to allophycocyanin (APC), a protein located at the base of the phycobilisome antenna of cyanobacteria. Coupling between pairs of phycocyanobilin pigments with nondegenerate energy levels gives rise to the four-level exciton electronic structure of APC. Spectroscopic signals obtained in multiple experiments (e.g., linear absorption, fluorescence, transient grating, 2D Fourier transform photon echo) are used to constrain the parameters of a Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian. Comparison between experiment and theory yields a robust microscopic understanding of the electronic and nuclear relaxation dynamics. In agreement with previous work, transient absorption anisotropy establishes that internal conversion between the exciton states of the dimer occurs with time constants of 35, 220, and 280 fs. The sub-100 fs dynamics are decomposed into three distinct relaxation processes: electronic population transfer, intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution, and the dephasing of electronic and nuclear coherences. Model calculations show that the sub-100 fs red-shift in the transient absorption signal spectrum reflects interference between stimulated emission (ESE) and excited state absorption (ESA) signal components. It is also established that the pigment fluctuations in the dimer are not well-correlated, although further experiments will be required to precisely quantify the amount of correlation. The findings of this paper suggest that the light harvesting function of APC is enhanced by nondegeneracy of the pigments comprising the dimer and strong vibronic coupling of intramolecular modes on the phycocyanobilins. We find that the exciton states are 96\% localized to the individual molecular sites within a particular dimer. Localization of the transition densities, in turn, is suggested to promote significant vibronic coupling which serves to both broaden the absorption line shape and open channels for fast internal conversion. The dominant internal conversion channel is assigned to a promoting mode near 800 cm-1 involving hydrogen out-of-plane (HOOP) wagging motion similar to that observed in phytochrome and retinal. This rate enhancement ensures that all photoexcitations quickly and efficiently relax to the electronic origin of the lower energy exciton state from which energy transfer to the reaction center occurs.},

This indicates that there are strong and complicated interactions between electronic states and vibration modes in realistic chemical systems. Therefore, simulations of quantum dynamics with a large number of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom are highly desirable. Due to the efficient compression and localized representation of quantum states in the matrix-product state (MPS) formulation, time-evolution methods based on the MPS framework, which we summarily refer to as tDMRG (time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group) methods, are considered to be promising candidates to study the quantum dynamics of realistic chemical systems. In this work, we benchmark the performances of four different tDMRG methods, including global Taylor, global Krylov, and local one-site and two-site time-dependent variational principles (1TDVP and 2TDVP), with a comparison to multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree and experimental results. Two typical chemical systems of internal conversion and singlet fission are investigated: one containing strong and high-order local and nonlocal electron-vibration couplings and the other exhibiting a continuous phonon bath. The comparison shows that the tDMRG methods (particularly, the 2TDVP method) can describe the full quantum dynamics in large chemical systems accurately and efficiently. Several key parameters in the tDMRG calculation including the truncation error threshold, time interval, and ordering of local sites were also investigated to strike the balance between efficiency and accuracy of results.},

This concept has been developed into a useful method to treat open quantum systems with a complete range of system-bath coupling strength. Especially, the polaron transformation approach shows its validity in the intermediate coupling regime, in which the Redfield equation or Fermi's golden rule will fail. In the polaron frame, the equilibrium distribution carried out by perturbative expansion presents a deviation from the canonical distribution, which is beyond the usual weak coupling assumption in thermodynamics. A polaron transformed Redfield equation (PTRE) not only reproduces the dissipative quantum dynamics but also provides an accurate and efficient way to calculate the non-equilibrium steady states. Applications of the PTRE approach to problems such as exciton diffusion, heat transport and light-harvesting energy transfer are presented.},

Built on the concept of quantum heat engine, our three-level model describes non-equilibrium quantum processes including light-harvesting energy transfer, nano-scale heat transfer, photo-induced isomerization, and photovoltaics in double quantum-dots. In the context of light-harvesting, the excitation energy is first pumped up by sunlight, then is transferred via two excited states which are coupled to a phonon bath, and finally decays to the reaction center. The efficiency of this process is evaluated by steady state analysis via a polaron-transformed master equation; thus the entire range of the system-phonon coupling strength can be covered. We show that the coupling with the phonon bath not only modifies the steady state, resulting in population inversion, but also introduces a finite steady state coherence which optimizes the energy transfer flux and efficiency. In the strong coupling limit, the steady state coherence disappears and the efficiency recovers the heat engine limit given by Scovil and Schultz-Dubois (1959 Phys. Rev. Lett. 2 262).},

There are several theoretical prescriptions of quantum dissipation but none of them is simple enough to be treated exactly in real applications. As a result, formulations in different prescriptions are practically used with different approximation schemes. This review examines both theoretical and application aspects on various perturbative formulations, especially those that are exact up to second-order but nonequivalent in high-order system-bath coupling contributions. Discrimination is made in favor of an unconventional formulation that in a sense combines the merits of both the conventional time-local and memory-kernel prescriptions, where the latter is least favorite in terms of the applicability range of parameters for system-bath coupling, non-Markovian, and temperature. Also highlighted is the importance of correlated driving and disspation effects, not only on the dynamics under strong external field driving, but also in the calculation of field-free correlation and response functions.},

This paper reviews the development and applications of a numerical simulation program, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion for QUantum Impurity with a Correlated Kernel (HEOM-QUICK), which allows for an accurate and universal characterization of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems. The HEOM-QUICK program implements the formally exact HEOM formalism for fermionic open systems. Its simulation results capture the combined effects of system-environment dissipation, many-body interactions, and non-Markovian memory in a nonperturbative manner. The HEOM-QUICK program has been employed to explore a wide range of static and dynamic properties of various types of quantum impurity systems, including charge or spin qubits, quantum dots, molecular junctions, and so on. It has also been utilized in conjunction with first-principles methods such as density-functional theory methods to study the correlated electronic structure of adsorbed magnetic molecules. The advantages in its accuracy, efficiency, and universality have made the HEOM-QUICK program a reliable and versatile tool for theoretical investigations on strong electron correlation effects in complex materials.

In the effectively one-dimensional representation of a system by matrix product states, long-ranged interactions are necessary to simulate not just many physical interactions but also higher-dimensional problems with short-ranged interactions. Since our method overcomes the restriction to short-ranged Hamiltonians of most existing methods, it proves particularly useful for studying the dynamics of both power-law interacting, one-dimensional systems, such as Coulombic and dipolar systems, and quasi-two-dimensional systems, such as strips or cylinders. First, we benchmark the method by verifying a long-standing theoretical prediction for the dynamical correlation functions of the Haldane-Shastry model. Second, we simulate the time evolution of an expanding cloud of particles in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, a subject of several recent experiments.},

  abstract = {A procedure is described for unbiased identification of all {$\pi$}-electron chromophore pair geometry choices that locally maximize the rate of conversion of a singlet exciton into a singlet biexciton (triplet pair), using a simplified version of the diabatic frontier orbital model of singlet fission (SF). The resulting approximate optimal geometries provide insight and are expected to represent useful starting points for searches by more advanced methods. The general procedure is illustrated on a pair of ethylenes as the simplest model of a {$\pi$}-electron system, but it is applicable to pairs of much larger molecules, with dozens of non-hydrogen atoms, and not necessarily planar. We first examine the value of |TA|2, the square of the electronic matrix element for SF with initial excitation fully localized on partner A, on a grid of several billion geometries within the six-dimensional space of physically realizable possibilities. Several of the optimized pair geometries are somewhat unexpected, but all are found to follow the qualitative guidance proposed earlier. In the neighborhood of each local maximum of |TA|2, consideration of mixing with charge-transfer configurations and of excitonic interaction between partners A and B determines the SF energy balance and yields squared matrix elements |T*|2 and |T**|2 for the lower and upper excitonic states S* and S**, respectively. Assuming Boltzmann populations of these states, the geometry is further optimized to maximize k, the sum of the SF rates obtained from Marcus theory, and this reorders the suitable geometries substantially. At 87 pair geometries, the |T*|2 and |T**|2 values are compared with those obtained from high-level ab initio nonorthogonal configuration interaction calculations and found to follow the same trend. Finally, the biexciton binding energy at the optimized geometries is calculated. Altogether, 13 significant local maxima of SF rate for a pair of ethylenes are identified in the physically relevant part of space that avoids molecular interpenetration in the hard-sphere approximation. The three best geometries are twist-stacked, slip-stacked, and L-shaped. The maxima occur at the (five-dimensional) surfaces of seven six-dimensional ``parent'' regions of space centered at physically inaccessible geometries at which the calculated SF rate is very large but the two ethylenes interpenetrate. The results are displayed in interactive graphics. The computer code (``Simple'') written for these calculations is flexible in that it permits a choice of performing the search for local maxima in six dimensions on |TA|2, |T*|2, or k.

  abstract = {One of the central advantages of the Herman Kluk Semiclassical Initial Value Representation (SCIVR) of the quantum propagator is that through its prefactor it approximately conserves unitarity for relatively long times. Its main disadvantage is that the prefactor appearing in the SCIVR propagator is expensive to compute as the dimensionality of the problem increases. When using the SCIVR series method for computation of the numerically exact quantum dynamics, the expense becomes even larger, since each term in the series involves a product of propagators, each with its own prefactor. This expense can be eliminated if one uses prefactor free propagators; however, these do not conserve unitarity as well as the HK propagator. As a compromise, we suggest the use of a hybrid propagator, in which the system variables are treated with the Herman-Kluk prefactor, while the bath variables are treated as prefactor free. Numerical application to a quartic oscillator coupled bilinearly to five harmonic bath oscillators demonstrates the viability of the hybrid method. The results presented are also a first application of the SCIVR series method to a system with six degrees of freedom. Convergence to the numerically exact answer using Monte Carlo sampling is obtained with at most the first two terms in the SCIVR series.},

In calculations on one-dimensional models, FEIT typically gives closer agreement than QTST with the exact quantum results at all temperatures below the crossover to deep tunneling, suggesting that FEIT is a better approximation than QTST in this regime. Here we show that this simple trend does not hold for systems of greater dimensionality. We report tests on several collinear and three-dimensional reactions, in which QTST outperforms FEIT over a range of temperatures below crossover, which can extend down to half the crossover temperature (below which FEIT outperforms QTST). This suggests that QTST-based methods such as ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) may often give closer agreement with the exact quantum results than FEIT.},

The multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method was employed to describe the singlet fission of the pentacene system with a three-state model. The ML-MCTDH result agrees well with the previous simulations using the Redfield theory, the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) and the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) theory. We carefully investigated the role of vibrational modes with different frequencies in singlet fission dynamics. Interestingly, we observed the important contribution of a few modes with frequency resonance to electronic transition. Such a finding can be understood by revisiting the superexchange mechanism within the framework of Fermi's golden rule. As a numerically exact method, ML-MCTDH not only provides an accurate description of the microscopy insight of the SF dynamics but also provides benchmark results to examine the performance of other approximated dynamical methods.},

On the T1 state, both radiative and nonradiative decay to S0 exit. The radiative decay forms the basis for the phosphorescence imaging in tissues as reported in the original paper. In addition, the nonradiative decay can simultaneously generate cytotoxic singlet oxygen by the excited energy transfer process, also known as triplet oxygen's quenching of triplet states. We conclude that the phosphorescence property as well as the photosensitizer character jointly bring high activity of in vivo imaging and photodynami},

  abstract = {We describe a new formulation of methods introduced in the theory of irreversibility by Van Hove and Prigogine, with the purpose of making their ideas easier to understand and to apply. The main tool in this reformulation is the use of projection operators in the Hilbert space of Gibbsian ensemble densities. Projection operators are used to separate an ensemble density into a ``relevant'' part, needed for the calculation of mean values of specified observables, and the remaining ``irrelevant'' part. The relevant part is shown to satisfy a kinetic equation which is a generalization of Van Hove's ``master equation to general order.'' Diagram summation methods are not used. The formalism is illustrated by a new derivation of the Prigogine-Brout master equation for a classical weakly interacting system.},

The intermolecular potential used is of the Lennard-Jones form, with an adjustable rigid sphere cutoff. A perturbation theory is developed, by which the thermodynamic properties of one system may be related to those of a slightly different system and to the difference in the intermolecular potentials of the two systems. In this article, the unperturbed system is a rigid sphere fluid, and the Lennard-Jones potential is the perturbation. The results are in fair agreement with experiment, and also lead to an experimental test of the theoretical rigid sphere equation of state.},

The electrostatic dipolar potential is considered to be a perturbation on the nonpolar Lennard-Jones potential. The dipole contribution to the equation of state is expressed in terms of properties of the unperturbed system. These properties are obtained from experimental data on argon and xenon. Numerical tables of the reduced equation of state of the polar gas, over a wide temperature and density range, are presented. The theory is tested on water vapor and on methyl fluoride. Theoretical predictions of the pressure agree with experimental data over a wide density range (up to 0.25 g/cc for water) to within several percent.},

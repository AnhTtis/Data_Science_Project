    "abstract": "Employing colliding-pulse injection has been shown to enable high-quality electron beams to be generated from laser-plasma accelerators. Here by leveraging test particle simulations, Hamiltonian analysis, and multidimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we lay the theoretical framework of spin-polarized electron beam generation in the colliding-pulse injection scheme. Furthermore, we show that this scheme enables the production of quasi-monoenergetic electron beams in excess of 80\\% polarization and tens pC charge with commercial 10-TW-class laser systems.",

In other words, how does one assess a software engineer's learning of a particular design pattern? This paper presents a framework and a tool motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy that extends an existing OWL ontology for design patterns in combination with assessment-generation heuristics to generate online assessments for software engineers. The resulting assessments are expressed in XML using the IMS-QTI standard. The paper also presents example assessments for GOF design patterns. © 2008 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Edge computing is getting more focused recently due to high demand of Artificial Intelligence application, for example, detection of wearing masks from a video stream. In edge computing, the AI applications are placed near data source to improve quality of service, and there are several researches to bring AI service onto edge device such as TensorFlow Serving. However, existing researches focus on providing accessibility of the trained model itself and require additional preprocessing and postprocessing of data to build an end-to-end service. In this paper, an AI Service Architecture for an Edge Device is proposed to provide accessibility to the AI service itself. The proposed architecture provides AI as a service, which means it includes pre-processing and postprocessing, as well as the model itself. Since it includes all the methods which consists an AI service, the proposed architecture provides more intuitive ways to bring an AI method to edge device. Moreover, it defines interfaces to configure and access the AI service, which makes it suitable apply microservice architecture.},

   abstract = {The impact of design patterns on quality attributes has been extensively evaluated in studies with different perspectives, objectives, metrics, and quality attributes, leading to contradictive and hard to compare results. The authors' objective is to explain these results by considering confounding factors, practices, metrics, or implementation issues that affect quality. Furthermore, there is a lack of research that connects design patterns evaluations to patterns development studies. Accordingly, they also aim at providing an initiate on how patterns structure and implementation can be improved, to promote software quality To achieve their goals, conducted a systematic literature review by searching the literature for related studies. The study covers the period between years 2000 and 2018. They identified 804 candidate papers. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, they were left with 50 primary studies. Their results show that documentation of patterns, size of pattern classes, and the scattering degree of patterns have clear impact on quality. In case studies, researchers used different metrics applied to different modules. Controlled experiments have major design differences. Reaching consensuses on the effect of patterns requires considering influencing factors, using unified metrics, and an agreement on what modules to measure. Studying how to improve patterns modularity is recommended for future research.},

In this paper we try to reveal the connection between design patterns and software maintainability. We analyzed more than 300 revisions of JHotDraw, a Java GUI framework whose design relies heavily on some well-known design patterns. We used our probabilistic quality model for estimating the maintainability and we parsed the javadoc annotations of the source code for gathering the pattern instances. We found that every introduced pattern instance caused an improvement in the different quality attributes. Moreover, the average design pattern line density showed a very high, 0.89 Pearson correlation with the estimated maintainability values. Although the amount of available empirical data is still very small, these first results suggest that the usage of design patterns do improve code maintainability. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Due to the current ineffectiveness of College English listening class, this paper puts forward a design of AI-based self-learning platform aimed at improving students' listening ability with AI assistance. The design concept and operation flow of this AI-based learning platform derive from the current application problems of AI-aided listening platforms for English learning. A survey is conducted to analyze the application characteristics of present AI-aided listening platforms for college English listening. The data analysis of the survey shows that the intelligent listening products have the merits such as rich listening resources, big exercise database and various learning channels. However, there are also some demerits like lack of specific and personalized exercise guidance, too wide material accumulation without logical classification, poor supervision and evaluation system. Based on the application problems, this paper introduces an AI-based self-learning platform for college English listening, which adopts three layer design concept e.g. service layer, technical layer and data layer. The three layers help form the integrated learning circle to improve students' daily self-learning efficiency. This AI-based self-learning platform can provide individual tailored teaching services, such as spontaneous learning help, learning suggestions and evaluations based on core technologies of artificial intelligence. It will create an effective self-learning environment and improve students' English listening proficiency in a better and more effective way.},

The proxy shields the AI artifact and pipelines from outside adversaries as well as from misbehaving users, thus building trust among the collaborating parties.

   abstract = {Recently, machine learning systems with inference engines have been widely used for a variety of purposes (such as prediction and classification) in our society. While it is quite important to keep the services provided by these machine learning systems stable, maintaining stability can be difficult given the nature of machine learning systems whose behaviors can be determined by program codes and input data. Therefore, quick troubleshooting (problem localization, rollback, etc.) is necessary. However, common machine learning systems with three-layer architectural patterns complicate the troubleshooting process because of their tightly coupled functions (e.g., business logic coded from design and inference engine derived from data). To solve the problem, we propose a novel architectural pattern for machine learning systems in which components for business logic and components for machine learning are separated. This architectural pattern helps operators break down the failures into a business logic part and a ML-specific part, and they can rollback the inference engine independent of the business logic when the inference engine has some problems. Through a practical case study scenario, we will show how our architectural pattern can make troubleshooting easier than common three-layer architecture.},

However, we have observed that the usage of layered architectural style varies greatly in different contexts. This paper aims to compare the notion of software architecture layers in research literature as well as in industrial practice. Firstly, we performed a systematic literature review of research articles on layered software architectures; we also reviewed selected books of software architecture. Secondly, to understand the practice, we investigated a number different recent architecture documents to cover the current usage of layered architectures. Our results indicate that there is very little actual research done on layered architectures. The current usage of layered structures seems to be more complex than reported before.

   abstract = {The ineffectiveness of many gamification projects can be attributed to wrong decisions made during the conceptual design phase, especially in the selection of game design elements. This paper introduces a data driven method of creating a gamification pattern language similar to software design patterns to help gamification designers select such elements. Thanks to modern machine learning technologies such a pattern language can be based on a comprehensive empirical analysis to assess the actual use of game design elements in games. This paper is the first report on an ongoing research project that has been carried out since the beginning of 2017 in cooperation with the German Games Archive to extract game design elements from more than 30,000 board games using machine learning techniques. Initial tests based on support vector classification and 4,000 games show that game design elements can be reliably identified with accuracy rates between 80 and 90%.},

Moreover, a systematic framework (morphology) is derived in order to classify current AI applications and to identify crucial AI technology composition patterns that might be helpful for future AI application development. Potentially promising scopes for the derivation of AI technology composition patterns are discussed and exemplary settings for employment of the proposed method are evaluated.},

Method We develop a preliminary framework and preliminary methodology, and use those to identify, extract and structure practitioners’ evidence, inference and beliefs. We illustrate the application of the framework and methodology with examples from a practitioner's blog post. Result The practitioner uses (factual) stories, analogies, examples and popular opinion as evidence, and uses that evidence in defeasible reasoning to justify his beliefs and to rebut the beliefs of other practitioners. Conclusion The framework, methodology and examples could provide a foundation for software engineering researchers to develop a more sophisticated understanding of, and appreciation for, practitioners’ defeasible evidence, inference and belief.

Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These approaches usually focus on a specific system type or on a certain application domain.

The purpose of such a pattern catalogue is to provide pattern for different types of software and to support the software development starting from design and ending with the implementation.

   abstract = {With the proliferation of AI-enabled software systems in smart manufacturing, the role of such systems moves away from a reactive to a proactive role that provides context-specific support to manufacturing operators. In the frame of the EU funded Teaming.AI project, we identified the monitoring of teaming aspects in human-AI collaboration, the runtime monitoring and validation of ethical policies, and the support for experimentation with data and machine learning algorithms as the most relevant challenges for human-AI teaming in smart manufacturing. Based on these challenges, we developed a reference software architecture based on knowledge graphs, tracking and scene analysis, and components for relational machine learning with a particular focus on its scalability. Our approach uses knowledge graphs to capture product and process specific knowledge in the manufacturing process and to utilize it for relational machine learning. This allows for context-specific recommendations for actions in the manufacturing process for the optimization of product quality and the prevention of physical harm. The empirical validation of this software architecture will be conducted in cooperation with three large-scale companies in the automotive, energy systems, and precision machining domain. In this paper we discuss the identified challenges for such a reference software architecture, present its preliminary status, and sketch our further research vision in this project.},

   abstract = {Context: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts, videos and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). MLRs are useful for both researchers and practitioners since they provide summaries both the state-of-the art and –practice in a given area. MLRs are popular in other fields and have recently started to appear in software engineering (SE). As more MLR studies are conducted and reported, it is important to have a set of guidelines to ensure high quality of MLR processes and their results. Objective: There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE. Method: To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example. Results: The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations. Conclusion: Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences.},

A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a SLR which includes grey literature in addition to the published (formal) literature. Only a few MLRs have been published in SE so far. We aim at raising the awareness for MLRs in SE by addressing two research questions (RQs): (1) What types of knowledge are missed when a SLR does not include the multivocal literature in a SE field? and (2) What do we, as a community, gain when we include the multivocal literature and conduct MLRs? To answer these RQs, we sample a few example SLRs and MLRs and identify the missing and the gained knowledge due to excluding or including the grey literature. We find that (1) grey literature can give substantial benefits in certain areas of SE, and that (2) the inclusion of grey literature brings forward certain challenges as evidence in them is often experience and opinion based. Given these conflicting viewpoints, the authors are planning to prepare systematic guidelines for performing MLRs in SE.},

Such conceptual solutions can then be applied in concrete use cases regardless of used technologies, such as software, middleware, or programming languages. As cloud computing is a new and developing field of commerce, new products and technologies are constantly made available to cloud users. In this scope, market dynamics often lead to confusing service descriptions. While advertising the individual properties of a specific cloud service may help in positioning it on the competitive market of cloud computing, they obfuscate the common underlying concepts. We therefore employ a pattern-like description language to describe cloud service models and cloud types in an abstract form to categorize the offerings of cloud providers. Further, we give reoccurring architectural patterns on how to design, build, and manage applications that use these cloud services. The abstracted form of these architectural patterns make them applicable to challenges that developers of cloud application face today, independent of the actual technologies and cloud services that they are using.},

   abstract = {This work in progress research-to-practice paper proposes an architecture model for active learning design pattern retrieval based on the concept of conversational recommender systems (C-RS). In earlier work, we proposed an object-based pedagogical design pattern model to generate abstraction of multiple unique implementations of collaborative active learning practices. This model helped in formalizing the problem-solution pairs that the educators face in collaborative active learning such as students' engagement in teams and class activities, social skill improvement, and assessment issues. Based on this model multiple patterns in different categories were developed through a systematic pattern development cycle combined with deductive elicitation methods and workshops. In this study, we propose an architectural model for an interactive pattern recommendation system. We use NLP models to extract the context of the problem that each pattern addresses. The extracted aspects are combined with the dimensions of each pattern based on attributes of the developed pattern model. The proposed architectural model is based on the model, view controller (MVC) pattern. In this model, the user interacts with the system through the 'view' layer. The 'model' layer stores the pattern language in the form of a graph in which each node of the graph represents one pattern, and the edges denote the relationship between the patterns. The 'controller' handles text analysis by NLP algorithms based on user input. One of the main features of our object-based design pattern model is its emphasis on team attributes by which different dimensions of collaboration in engineering education are addressed. The implementation of the developed architectural model would enable the instructors to identify possible solutions to the pedagogical challenges they face in teaching engineering classes where teamwork is an integrated part of the learning process.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly broadly adopted in industry. However, based on well over a dozen case studies, we have learned that deploying industry-strength, production quality ML models in systems proves to be challenging. Companies experience challenges related to data quality, design methods and processes, performance of models as well as deployment and compliance. We learned that a new, structured engineering approach is required to construct and evolve systems that contain ML/DL components. In this chapter, the authors provide a conceptualization of the typical evolution patterns that companies experience when employing ML as well as an overview of the key problems experienced by the companies that they have studied. The main contribution of the chapter is a research agenda for AI engineering that provides an overview of the key engineering challenges surrounding ML solutions and an overview of open items that need to be addressed by the research community at large.},

  abstract = {Design patterns are widely used by software developers to build complex systems. Hence, they have been investigated by many researchers in recent decades. This leads to the emergence of various topics in the design patterns field. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the research efforts on design patterns for those researchers who seek to enter this area. The main contributions are as follows: (a) identifying research topics in design patterns, (b) quantifying the research emphasis on each topic, and (c) describing the demographics of design patterns research. The last secondary study with similar goals in the design patterns field considers the Gang of Four design patterns only. However, the scope of the current study is all of the design patterns. Moreover, our review covers about six additional years and a larger number of publications and venues. In this systematic mapping study, a total of 2775 papers were identified as relevant, and 637 of them were included. According to the results, design patterns can be classified into six different research topics. As a consequence, it is concluded that Pattern Development, Pattern Mining, and Pattern Usage are the most active topics in the field of design patterns.}

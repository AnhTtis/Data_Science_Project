    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the explicit birational geometry for projective $ε$-lc varieties polarised by nef and big Weil divisors. We show that if $X$ is a projective $ε$-lc variety, $H$ is a nef and big Weil divisor with $\\dim\\overline{\\varphi_{H}(X)}\\geq n-1$ and $L$ is an effective Weil divisor such that $|L-K_X|\\neq \\emptyset$ or $L-K_X$ is nef, then we can find an explicit lower bound of $\\text{vol}(H)$ and prove that $|L+m^\\prime H|$ is birational for $m^\\prime\\geq m$, where $m$ is an explicit number which depends only on $n$ and $ε$. This result can be applied to polarised Calabi-Yau varieties, Fano varieties and varieties of general type, generalizing the results in [CEW22] and [Zhu23].",

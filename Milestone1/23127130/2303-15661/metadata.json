    "abstract": "We demonstrate an optical realization for the rotating BTZ black hole using the recent popular photon fluid model in an optical vortex but with a new proposed expression for the optical phase. We also give the numerical realization for the optical vortex to ensure that it can be generated experimentally. Different from the earlier suggestions for the analogue rotating black holes, our proposal includes an inner horizon in the analogue black hole structure. Such structure can keep for a long distance for the convenience of observing analogue Hawking or Penrose radiations.",

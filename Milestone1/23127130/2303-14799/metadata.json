    "abstract": "Using the closure operator that defines a subtractive ideal of a semiring $S$, in this note we introduce a topology on the set of all ideals of $S$ induced by that operator. We show that the corresponding subtractive space is $T_0$ and every nonempty irreducible closed set has a unique generic point, whereas the restricted subspace of subtractive ideals is $T_1$. Using a semiring homomorphism, we obtain a continuous map between the corresponding subtractive spaces.",

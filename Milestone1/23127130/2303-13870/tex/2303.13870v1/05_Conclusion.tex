\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed a novel metric to drive the
cell selection process of \acp{UAV} on  aerial highways supported by a terrestrial \ac{mMIMO} network.
% 
Our results showed that integrating our proposed metric, 
which is capable of capturing information on the spatial diversity between each aerial highway and sector, allows recognising and then associating with serving cells that provide a better and fairer \ac{SINR} performance,
especially when the number of flying \acp{CCUAV} increases. 
%
Future work will enhance our considerations,
by extending the metric also to embrace additional features such as information on the ground traffic condition.

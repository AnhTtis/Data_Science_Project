In this article, 
we introduce a new metric for driving the serving cell selection process of a swarm of cellular connected unmanned aerial vehicles (CCUAVs) located on aerial highways when served by
a massive multiple input multiple output (mMIMO) terrestrial network.

Selecting the optimal serving cell from several suitable candidates is not straightforward.
By solely relying on the traditional cell selection metric, 
based on reference signal received power (RSRP),
it is possible to result in a scenario in which the serving cell can not multiplex an appropriate number of CCUAVs due to the high correlation in the line of sight (LoS) channels.
%
To overcome such issue, 
in this work, 
we introduce a new cell selection metric to capture not only signal strength, 
but also spatial multiplexing capabilities.
The proposed metric highly depends on the relative position between the aerial highways and the antennas of the base station.
%
The numerical analysis indicates that the integration of the proposed new metric allows to have a better signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) performance on the aerial highways,
resulting in a more reliable cellular connection for CCUAVs.

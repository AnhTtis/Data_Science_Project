    "abstract": "PMT and SiPM are often used to detect a small number of photons produced by very weak radiations. A light guide usually connects these photodetectors to the test space. This research investigated background signals caused by cosmic muons due to the scintillation of the materials in the light guide and input window of PMT and SiPM. The amount of this scintillation is relatively determined by simulation and experiments. Cosmic muons emitting photons in these structures can leave a significant background error in low radiation and single photon detection if a standard scintillator is not used. These signals can be much stronger than dark current signals.",

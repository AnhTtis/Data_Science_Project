    "abstract": "Recently, Belhadi and al. (2014) developed a new approach to quantize classical soluble systems based on the calculation of brackets among fundamental variables using the constants of integration (CI method). In this paper, we will apply this approach in some exactly soluble constrained Hamiltonian systems. We will complete our work with some applications in quantum field theory : Majorana neutrino, the scalar field on the light-cone, the O(2) nonlinear sigma model and the chiral boson theory.\n  Key words : Quantization, constrainted systems, field theory, soluble systems, integration constants.",

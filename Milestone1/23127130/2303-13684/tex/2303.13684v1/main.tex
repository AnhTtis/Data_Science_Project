\begin{abstract}
The multicontextual nature of immersive VR makes it difficult to ensure contextual integrity of VR-generated information flows using existing privacy design and policy mechanisms. In this position paper, we call on the HCI community to do away with lengthy disclosures and permissions models and move towards embracing privacy mechanisms rooted in Contextual Integrity theory.

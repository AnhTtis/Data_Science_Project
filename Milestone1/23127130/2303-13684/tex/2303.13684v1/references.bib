	abstract = {Notifying users about a system's data practices is supposed to enable users to make informed privacy decisions. Yet, current notice and choice mechanisms, such as privacy policies, are often ineffective because they are neither usable nor useful, and are therefore ignored by users. Constrained interfaces on mobile devices, wearables, and smart home devices connected in an Internet of Things exacerbate the issue. Much research has studied usability issues of privacy notices and many proposals for more usable privacy notices exist. Yet, there is little guidance for designers and developers on the design aspects that can impact the effectiveness of privacy notices. In this paper, we make multiple contributions to remedy this issue. We survey the existing literature on privacy notices and identify challenges, requirements, and best practices for privacy notice design. Further, we map out the design space for privacy notices by identifying relevant dimensions. This provides a taxonomy and consistent terminology of notice approaches to foster understanding and reasoning about notice options available in the context of specific systems. Our systemization of knowledge and the developed design space can help designers, developers, and researchers identify notice and choice requirements and develop a comprehensive notice concept for their system that addresses the needs of different audiences and considers the system's limitations and opportunities for providing notice.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Oculus, a virtual reality company, recently announced that it willrequire all its users to have a personal Facebook account to access itsfull service. The announcement infuriated users around the world, whofeared increased privacy risks from virtual reality, a computergenerated technology that creates a simulated world. The goal ofvirtual reality is to offer an immersive experience that appears as realas possible to its users. Providing such an experience necessitatescollection, processing, and use of extensive user data, which begetscorresponding privacy risks. But how extensive are the risks?{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This Note examines the unique capacities and purpose of virtualreality and analyzes whether virtual reality data presentsfundamentally greater privacy risks than data from other internetconnected devices, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), and if so,whether it poses any special challenges to data privacy regulationregimes, namely the European Union’s General Data ProtectionRegulation (GDPR), the world’s most stringent and influential dataprivacy law. Currently, one of the key criticisms of the GDPR is its lowand ambiguous standard for obtaining users’ “informed consent,” orthe process by which a fully informed user participates in decisionsabout their personal data. For example, a user who checks off a simplebox after reading a privacy policy gives informed consent under theGDPR. This Note argues that virtual reality exposes a morefundamental problem of the GDPR: the futility of text-based informedconsent in the context of virtual reality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This Note supports this claim by analyzing how virtual realitywidens the gap between the users’ understanding of the implicationsof their consent and the actual implications. It first illustrates howvirtual reality service providers must collect and process x-ray-likedata from each user, such as physiological data like eye movementsand gait, to provide customizations necessary to create an immersiveexperience. Based on this data, the service providers can know moreabout each user than what each user knows about themselves. Yet, thisknowledge shift is not obvious to users. For virtual reality service toprovide an immersive experience, customizations based on user datamust be unnoticeable to users to avoid distractions. Using Oculus’srecent privacy policy as a case study, this Note shows how this hiddenknowledge shift transforms the meaning of ordinary privacy policyphrases like “an experience unique and relevant to you.” What Oculusfinds to be “relevant” to the user could be beyond what the userthemselves would imagine to be “relevant.” As a result, the textbecomes an obsolete medium to communicate privacy risks to virtualreality users. This Note instead proposes other solutions—such ascustomizable privacy settings and visualization of privacy risks—forusers to more closely understand and consciously weigh the benefitsand the risks of using virtual reality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

IEEEVR2020 coincided with rising concerns and restrictions on travel and large gatherings, becoming one of the first academic conferences to rapidly adapt its programming to a completely virtual format. The global pandemic provided an impetus to re-examine the possibility of holding social interactions in virtual worlds. This article aims to: (1) revisit the issues of virtual conferences noted in earlier studies, focusing specifically on academic conferences, (2) introduce new survey and observational data from the recent IEEEVR2020 conference, and (3) present insights and future directions for virtual conferences during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from a field observation during the conference and a post-conference survey point to complex relationships among users, media platforms selected, and social constraints during the virtual conference.},

	abstract = {Modern enterprises rely on Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) systems to enforce privacy policies that prevent unintentional flow of sensitive information to unauthorized entities. However, these systems operate based on rule sets that are limited to syntactic analysis and therefore completely ignore the semantic relationships between participants involved in the information exchanges. For similar reasons, these systems cannot enforce complex privacy policies that require temporal reasoning about events that have previously occurred. To address these limitations, we advocate a new design methodology for DLP systems centered on the notion of Contextual Integrity (CI). We use the CI framework to abstract real-world communication exchanges into formally defined information flows where privacy policies describe sequences of admissible flows. CI allows us to decouple (1) the syntactic extraction of flows from information exchanges, and (2) the enforcement of privacy policies on these flows. We applied this approach to built VACCINE, a DLP auditing system for emails. VACCINE uses state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing to extract flows from email text. It also provides a declarative language for describing privacy policies. These policies are automatically compiled to operational rules that the system uses for detecting data leakages. We evaluated VACCINE on the Enron email corpus and show that it improves over the state of the art both in terms of the expressivity of the policies that DLP systems can enforce as well as its precision in detecting data leakages.},

Contextual integrity (CI) (Nissenbaum, 2010) offers a model for conceptualizing privacy that is able to bridge technical design with ethical, legal, and policy approaches. While CI is capable of capturing the various components of contextual privacy in theory, it is challenging to discover and formally express these norms in operational terms. In the following, we propose a crowdsourcing method for the automated discovery of contextual norms. To evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, we conducted an extensive survey on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) with more than 450 participants and 1400 questions. The paper has three main takeaways: First, we demonstrate the ability to generate survey questions corresponding to privacy norms within any context. Second, we show that crowdsourcing enables the discovery of norms from these questions with strong majoritarian consensus among users. Finally, we demonstrate how the norms thus discovered can be encoded into a formal logic to automatically verify their consistency.},

This method allows for the systematized detection of issues with privacy policy statements that hinder readers’ ability to understand and evaluate company data collection practices. These issues include missing contextual details, vague language, and overwhelming possible interpretations of described information transfers. We demonstrate this method in two different settings. First, we compare versions of Facebook’s privacy policy from before and after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Our analysis indicates that the updated policy still contains fundamental ambiguities that limit readers’ comprehension of Facebook’s data collection practices. Second, we successfully crowdsourced CI annotations of 48 excerpts of privacy policies from 17 companies with 141 crowdworkers. This indicates that regular users are able to reliably identify contextual information in privacy policy statements and that crowdsourcing can help scale our CI analysis method to a larger number of privacy policy statements.},

VR has now reached a point where it can offer photorealistic experiences, while also being consumer-friendly and affordable. However, so far only a very limited amount of software has been developed for the specific purpose of conducting (social science) research. In this article, we illustrate that integrating virtual reality to good effect in social science research does not necessarily require specialized hardware or software, an abundance of expertise regarding VR-technology or even a large budget. We do this by discussing our use of a method we have come to call ?VR-assisted interviews?: conducting a (semi-structured) interview while respondents are confronted with a virtual environment viewed via a VR-headset. This method allows respondents to focus on what they are seeing and experiencing, instead of having them worry about how to operate a device and navigate an interface they are using for the first time. ?VR-assisted interviews? are very user-friendly for respondents but also limits options for interactiveness. We believe this method can be a valuable alternative, both because of methodological and practical considerations, for more complex applications of VR-technology in social science research.},

Up until now, the vast majority of studies investigating the coordinated eye and hand movement in a grasping task focused on single objects manipulation without placing them in a meaningful scene. Very little is known about the impact of the scene context on how we manipulate objects in an interactive task. In the present study, it was investigated how the scene context affects human object manipulation in a pick-and-place task in a realistic scenario implemented in VR. During the experiment, participants were instructed to find the target object in a room, pick it up, and transport it to a predefined final location. Thereafter, the impact of the scene context on different stages of the task was examined using head and hand movement, as well as eye tracking. As the main result, the scene context had a significant effect on the search and transport phases, but not on the reach phase of the task. The present work provides insights into the development of potential supporting intention predicting systems, revealing the dynamics of the pick-and-place task behavior once it is realized in a realistic context-rich scenario.},

(1) We created an experience prototype that features basic VR scenarios and a tangible baby, (2) we engaged in design sessions with 19 parents and parents-to-be to derive design implications to further refine the simulation, and (3) we evaluated the system through case studies to examine the perspectives of parents and parents-to-be on the simulation. Our results show that the simulation successfully engaged users and sparked curiosity, while also encouraging reflection about the challenges of breastfeeding. On this basis, we discuss challenges for the design of simulations with the purpose of supplementing antenatal education.},

Here, we developed an approach to leverage context-dependence to optimise learning of challenging, interference-prone material. While navigating through desktop virtual reality (VR) contexts, participants learnt 80 foreign words in two phonetically similar languages. Those participants who learnt each language in its own unique context showed reduced interference and improved one-week retention (92\%), relative to those who learnt the languages in the same context (76\%)—however, this advantage was only apparent if participants subjectively experienced VR-based contexts as “real” environments. A follow-up fMRI experiment confirmed that reinstatement of brain activity patterns associated with the original encoding context during word retrieval was associated with improved recall performance. These findings establish that context-dependence can be harnessed with VR to optimise learning and showcase the important role of mental context reinstatement.},

Current privacy protection measures are primarily aimed towards known and well-utilised data types (i.e. location, on-line activity, biometric, and so on) while a few works have focused on looking into the security and privacy risks of and providing protection on MR data, particularly on 3D MR data. In this work, we primarily reveal the privacy leakage from released 3D MR data and how the leakage persist even after implementing spatial generalizations and abstractions. Firstly, we formalize the spatial privacy problem in 3D mixed reality data as well as the adversary model. Then, we demonstrate through an inference model how adversaries can identify 3D spaces and, potentially, infer more spatial information. Moreover, we also demonstrate how compact 3D MR Data can be in terms of memory usage which allows adversaries to create lightweight 3D inference models of user spaces.},

Intending to present realistic environments, VR applications are including text that we are surrounded by every day. However, text can only add value to the virtual environment if it is designed and created in such a way that users can comfortably read it. With the aim to explore what values for text parameters users find comfortable while reading in virtual reality, a study was conducted allowing participants to manipulate text parameters such as font size, distance, and contrast. Therefore two different standalone virtual reality devices were used, Oculus Go and Quest, together with three different text samples: Short (2 words), medium (21 words), and long (51 words). Participants had the task of setting text parameters to the best and worst possible value. Additionally, participants were asked to rate their experience of reading in virtual reality. Results report mean values for angular size (the combination of distance and font size) and color contrast depending on the different device used as well as the varying text length, for both tasks. Significant differences were found for values of angular size, depending on the length of the displayed text. However, different device types had no significant influence on text parameters but on the experiences reported using the self-assessment manikin (SAM) scale.},

	abstract = {Sensor-enabled computers in the form of 'IoT' devices such as home security cameras and voice assistants are increasingly becoming pervasive in our environment. With the embedded cameras and microphones in these devices, this 'invasion' of our everyday spaces can pose significant threats to the privacy of bystanders. Because of their complex functionality, even when people attempt privacy measures (such as asking the owner to "turn the camera off"), these devices may still record information because of the lack of a 'real' off button. With the ambiguities of current designs, a bystander's perceived privacy can diverge from their actual privacy. Indeed, being able to assess one's actual privacy is a key aspect in managing one's privacy according to Altman's theory of boundary regulation, and current designs fall short in assuring people of their privacy. To understand how people as bystanders manage their privacy with IoT devices, we conducted an interview study about people's perceptions of and behaviors around current IoT devices. We find that although participants' behaviors line up with Altman's theory of boundary regulation, in the face of uncertainty about their privacy, they desire or engage in various 'tangible' workarounds. Based on our findings, we identify and introduce the concept of 'tangible privacy' as being essential to boundary regulation with IoT devices. We argue that IoT devices should be designed in a way that clearly and unambiguously conveys sensor states to people around them and make actionable design recommendations to provide strong privacy assurances to bystanders.},

While it has long been known that people reveal information about themselves via their motion, the extent to which this makes an individual globally identifiable within virtual reality has not yet been widely understood. In this study, we show that a large number of real VR users (N=55,541) can be uniquely and reliably identified across multiple sessions using just their head and hand motion relative to virtual objects. After training a classification model on 5 minutes of data per person, a user can be uniquely identified amongst the entire pool of 50,000+ with 94.33\% accuracy from 100 seconds of motion, and with 73.20\% accuracy from just 10 seconds of motion.

	abstract = {Privacy is a widely studied concept in relation to social computing and sensor-based technologies; scores of research papers have investigated people's "privacy preferences" and apparent reluctance to share personal data. In this paper we explore how Ubicomp and HCI studies have approached the notion of privacy, often as a quantifiable concept. Leaning on several theoretical frameworks, but in particular Nissenbaum's notion of contextual integrity, we question the viability of obtaining universal answers in terms of people's "general" privacy practices and apply elements of Nissenbaum's theory to our own data in order to illustrate its relevance. We then suggest restructuring inquiries into information sharing in studies of state-of-the-art technologies and analyze contextually grounded issues using a different, more specific vocabulary. Finally, we provide the first building blocks to such vocabulary.},

This article develops a general, functional approach to evaluating technological change, inspired by Nissenbaum’s theory of contextual integrity. Nissenbaum (2009) introduced the concept of contextual integrity to help analyze how technological changes can produce privacy problems. Reinterpreted, the concept of contextual integrity can aid our thinking about how technological changes affect the full range of human concerns and values—not only privacy. I propose a generalized concept of contextual integrity that is applicable to a broader variety of circumstances, and I outline a new, general procedure for technological evaluation. Among the attractive features of the proposed approach to evaluating technological change are its context-sensitivity, adaptability, and principled presumptive conservatism, enabled by the mechanism the approach supplies for reevaluating existing practices, norms, and values.},

For this initial analysis, we used a keyword search and examined peer-reviewed papers published between the years of 2008 and 2017 in the top 20 HCI venues according to Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Research. Overall, we found that many of the studies do not implement CI within the design of their study nor do they provide summative evaluations. To close these gaps, we recommend HCI researchers to engage more thoroughly with the framework to inform their research designs and conduct studies that provide a deeper understanding of how the framework applies and can be extended in various contexts. We also recommend researchers pursue more summative evaluations based on CI for new technology solutions.},

	abstract = {Metaverse has rekindled human beings' desire to further break space-time barriers by fusing the virtual and real worlds. However, security and privacy threats hinder us from building a utopia. A metaverse embraces various techniques, while at the same time inheriting their pitfalls and thus exposing large attack surfaces. Blockchain, proposed in 2008, was regarded as a key building block of metaverses. it enables transparent and trusted computing environments using tamper-resistant decentralized ledgers. Currently, blockchain supports Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-fungible Tokens (NFT) for metaverses. However, the power of a blockchain has not been sufficiently exploited. In this article, we propose a novel trustless architecture of blockchain-enabled metaverse, aiming to provide efficient resource integration and allocation by consolidating hardware and software components. To realize our design objectives, we provide an On-Demand Trusted Computing Environment (OTCE) technique based on local trust evaluation. Specifically, the architecture adopts a hypergraph to represent a metaverse, in which each hyperedge links a group of users with certain relationship. Then the trust level of each user group can be evaluated based on graph analytics techniques. Based on the trust value, each group can determine its security plan on demand, free from interference by irrelevant nodes. Besides, OTCEs enable large-scale and flexible application environments (sandboxes) while preserving a strong security guarantee.},

	abstract = {Extended Reality (XR) is expected to grow at a rapid pace over the next decade. Currently, especially in the United States, digital privacy protections do not provide adequate levels of privacy and safety protection from being violated as an individual or group. This thesis presents findings from 29 interviews with Expert and practitioners to understand how the XR industry begin to move forward given that binary options of consent will not suffice in XR, and we cannot wait to try to fix our mistakes as we have done in the online world with social media disinformation. This thesis first analyzed the XR Safety Initiative's Privacy and Safety Framework (XRSI), which served as the foundation for creating the questions for Expert and practitioner interviews. The priority of that analysis was to identify elements of the XRSI that had opportunities to provide deeper guidance on the existing XR privacy recommendations from the online world. It became clear that there were gaps around the Inform section (1.5) and specifically around consent (1.5.2), choice (1.5.3), and control (1.5.4), which allowed for the formulation and prioritization interview questions for participants (XRSI, 2020). The research found that privacy experts believe that the fear of negative financial implications, resulting from unknown business outcomes of privacy policies that provide adaptable levels of consent, increases users' risk is the biggest hurdle to overcome. XRSI can, and should, help address this issue by increasing its support for its stakeholders. Importantly, 64\% of respondents stated that there should be an opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of parts of an experience. Moreover, of those interviewed, 14\% of all respondents that did not initially name opt-in/out as their first choice choose this option as their second-most vital way to grant consent. \_},

Currently, AR applications usually present results without limitations, which causes great latent danger to users, so it is necessary to apply strategies to ensure the safe output of AR. Due to the environmental diversities among the distributed users, the traditional approaches designed for single-user AR are not efficient for multi-user AR applications. Considering the characteristics of multi-user AR scenarios, we propose a multi-user AR output strategy model based on Federated Reinforcement Learning. With the device-fog-cloud hierarchical architecture, the proposed models are obtained first by Reinforcement Learning on users' devices, and are then hierarchically aggregated on the fog nodes and cloud server. We performed extensive AR simulations in Unity and obtained the results that show our method can avoid several security problems existent in multi-user AR applications.},

	abstract = {Extended Reality (XR) — an umbrella term for Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) — has penetrated the consumer market and is prone to increasingly impact our lives in the near future. Various devices, e.g., MR glasses, AR smartphones apps, or VR headsets, are becoming more affordable, and leader tech companies are heavily investing for a more immersive, realistic, and connected future. Lately, this vision of an interconnected virtual space for people to work, learn, play and share experiences with others has been formulated as the so-called “Metaverse”. This expected paradigm shift will heavily rely on XR, and hence implies an unprecedented amount of sensible data being collected about the users. Indeed, XR devices collect large amounts of sensitive data, including biometric data (e.g., eye gaze and body movement data) that are primarily used as Natural User Interfaces (NUIs) or for the proper functioning of technologies and services. However, research has identified a number of privacy and security threats rooting from this pervasive data collection, as well as privacy threats regarding XR inputs, outputs, user interactions and devices themselves. Still, further efforts must be made to guarantee the privacy and safety of users in a usable fashion in the future, and XR must be considered as a whole rather than as the sum of its parts to match the vision of the Metaverse. In this context, we propose to analyse the gap between user privacy perceptions in XR as a whole, and their concrete behaviour. The goal of this research is to understand the differences and similarities between AR, MR and VR in terms of user privacy perceptions. This will help us to better understand the relationships between XR variants, which, we argue, is an important requirement to approach the future evolution of these technologies, and to consider usable privacy aspects that match the entire XR spectrum. Adopting this vision early on will be beneficial for future work, and will be the foundation for the implementation of a usable privacy-preserving solution in order to raise awareness and empower users by giving them more control over their privacy in the context of these new and future technologies.},

Based on the use cases from an actual social VRLE viz., vSocial, we first model the security and privacy using the attack trees. Subsequently, these attack trees are converted into stochastic timed automata representations that allow for rigorous statistical model checking. Such an analysis helps us adopt pertinent design principles such as hardening, diversity and principle of least privilege to enhance the resilience of social VRLEs. Through experiments in a vSocial case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack tree modeling with a reduction of 26\% in probability of loss of integrity (security) and 80\% in privacy leakage (privacy) in before and after scenarios pertaining to the adoption of the design principles.},

In a mobile escape room game, users engage with the data collection and processing by solving different puzzles. We validated the game concept in a user study by comparing it to a conventional textual policy. Our findings show that the game promoted greater information recall in users. However, a trade-off seems to exist between frustration, duration and understanding. We show strategies for turning a privacy policy into game elements for a mobile escape room game and incorporating privacy information into different puzzles. We recommend that the choice of a privacy policy format should vary in a case-by-case scenario and should accommodate different target audiences.},

In contrast to Virtual Reality, where one's environment is fully replaced with a virtual one, one of AR's "killer features" is co-located collaboration, in which multiple users interact with the same combination of virtual and real objects. Microsoft recently released HoloLens, the first consumer-ready augmented reality headset that needs no outside markers to achieve precise inside-out spatial mapping, which allows centimeter-scale hologram positioning. However, despite many applications published on the Windows Mixed Reality platform that rely on direct communication between AR devices, there currently exists no implementation or achievable proposal for secure direct pairing of two unassociated headsets. As augmented reality gets into mainstream, this omission exposes current and future users to a range of avoidable attacks. In order to close this real-world gap in both theory and engineering practice, in this paper we design and evaluate HoloPair, a system for secure and usable pairing of two AR headsets. We propose a pairing protocol and build a working prototype to experimentally evaluate its security guarantees, usability, and system performance. By running a user study with a total of 22 participants, we show that the system achieves high rates of attack detection, short pairing times, and a high average usability score. Moreover, in order to make an immediate impact on the wider developer community, we have published the full implementation and source code of our prototype, which is currently under consideration to be included in the official HoloLens development toolkit.},

Second, VR technology raises serious concerns related to personal neglect of users’ own actual bodies and real physical environments. Third, VR technologies may be used to record personal data which could be deployed in ways that threaten personal privacy and present a danger related to manipulation of users’ beliefs, emotions, and behaviors. Finally, there are other moral and social risks associated with the way VR blurs the distinction between the real and illusory. These concerns regarding VR naturally raise questions about public policy. The article makes several recommendations for legal regulations of VR that together address each of the above concerns. It is argued that these regulations would not seriously threaten personal liberty but rather would protect and enhance the autonomy of VR consumers.},

	abstract = {Current Social VR literature provides limited insight on one of the most critical behaviors for developing and maintaining interpersonal relationships: self-disclosure. Therefore, we present an online survey (N = 126) investigating how users disclose personal information to each other in Social VR. Our results indicate that many participants see in Social VR access to authentic connections with others despite tending towards skepticism and privacy concerns. Most users disclose sexuality-related information, lifestyle preferences, and personal goals. In contrast, information that breaks anonymity, such as real names and more intimate aspects of oneself, are shared less commonly. Thereby, self-disclosure decisions depend on factors like the relationship to or age of disclosure recipients, the privacy of a virtual environment, the group size, or the activity context, and is driven by different goals, i.a., relational development or exploration of oneself. These insights advance the understanding of current Social VR users and their behavior by directing future research on self-disclosure-based relationship building in Social VR and outlying broader design implications for the future metaverse.},

	abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is an exciting new consumer technology which offers an immersive audio-visual experience to users through which they can navigate and interact with a digitally represented 3D space (i.e., a virtual world) using a headset device. By (visually) transporting users from the real or physical world to exciting and realistic virtual spaces, VR systems can enable true-to-life and more interactive versions of traditional applications such as gaming, remote conferencing, social networking and virtual tourism. However, as with any new consumer technology, VR applications also present significant user-privacy challenges. This paper studies a new type of privacy attack targeting VR users by connecting their activities visible in the virtual world (enabled by some VR application/service) to their physical state sensed in the real world. Specifically, this paper analyzes the feasibility of carrying out a de-anonymization or identification attack on VR users by correlating visually observed movements of users' avatars in the virtual world with some auxiliary data (e.g., motion sensor data from mobile/wearable devices held by users) representing their context/state in the physical world. To enable this attack, this paper proposes a novel framework which first employs a learning-based activity classification approach to translate the disparate visual movement data and motion sensor data into an activity-vector to ease comparison, followed by a filtering and identity ranking phase outputting an ordered list of potential identities corresponding to the target visual movement data. Extensive empirical evaluation of the proposed framework, under a comprehensive set of experimental settings, demonstrates the feasibility of such a de-anonymization attack.},

By gathering information about students as they navigate information systems, learning analytics employs techniques to understand student behaviors and to improve instructional, curricular, and support resources and learning environments. However, learning analytics presents important moral and policy issues surrounding student privacy. We argue that there are five crucial questions about student privacy that we must address in order to ensure that whatever the laudable goals and gains of learning analytics, they are commensurate with respecting students' privacy and associated rights, including (but not limited to) autonomy interests. We address information access concerns, the intrusive nature of information-gathering practices, whether or not learning analytics is justified given the potential distribution of consequences and benefits, and issues related to student autonomy. Finally, we question whether learning analytics advances the aims of higher education or runs counter to those goals.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR), which overlays virtual content on top of the user’s perception of the real world, has now begun to enter the consumer market. Besides smartphone platforms, early-stage head-mounted displays such as the Microsoft HoloLens are under active development. Many compelling uses of these technologies are multi-user: e.g., in-person collaborative tools, multiplayer gaming, and telepresence. While prior work on AR security and privacy has studied potential risks from AR applications on a single user’s device, new risks will also arise among multiple human users. In this thesis, I explore the challenges that arise in designing secure and private content sharing for multi-user AR. Grounded in ﬁndings from a qualitative study of users’ security- and privacy-relevant perceptions in multi-user AR contexts, I analyze the design implications of coexisting and competing functionality and security needs. My collaborators and I formulate representative application case studies and systematize design goals for security and functionality that a multi-user AR platform should support. We ﬁnd that AR’s unique security and privacy design challenges hinge on the integration of virtual content with 3D physical space. With this key point in mind, we design an AR content sharing control module that achieves these goals and build a prototype implementation (ShareAR) for the HoloLens. This thesis builds a foundation for enabling secure and private multi-user AR interactions.},

It is unclear if users just do not care, if they are missing the appropriate tools or user interfaces, or if they live in the delusion of being in control of their data. We argue that non-user-friendly design presents a key obstacle in making privacy controls work: it hinders users to effectively set up and maintain privacy settings. Our ultimate goal is to support the user by automatically suggesting access control lists based on an analysis of her communication metadata. To guide us in the design of such privacy suggestions, we perform an explorative questionnaire-based study with 42 participants. Our results confirm that users are overtaxed with existing schemes. We identify the expectations and preferences of users, thus facilitating the design of improved solutions.},

Interactivity improved time spent with the policy. There were no effects on conversion rate, perceived control or perceived trust, efficiency and perspicuity.

	abstract = {Researchers have explored the benefits and applications of virtual reality (VR) in different scenarios. VR possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (HMDs). Hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of VR in higher education. The reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher education sphere—for instance, learning theories were not often considered in VR application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of VR design for education, which could motivate future work in the field.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, research has shown that both technical solutions and user perceptions are important to improve security and privacy in the digital realm. The field of ‘usable security’ already started to emerge in the mid-90s, primarily focussed on password and email security. Later on, the research field of ”usable security and privacy” evolved and broadened the aim to design concepts and tools to assist users in enhancing their behaviour with regard to both privacy and security. Nevertheless, many user interventions are not as effective as desired. Because of highly diverse usage contexts, leading to different privacy and security requirements and not always to one-size-fits-all approaches, tailorability is necessary to address this issue. Furthermore, transparency is a crucial requirement, as providing comprehensible information may counter reactance towards security interventions. This article first provides a brief history of the research field in its first quarter-century and then highlights research on the transparency and tailorability of user interventions. Based on this, this article then presents six contributions with regard to (1) privacy concerns in times of COVID-19, (2) authentication on mobile devices, (3) GDPR-compliant data management, (4) privacy notices on websites, (5) data disclosure scenarios in agriculture, as well as (6) rights under data protection law and the concrete process should data subjects want to claim those rights. This article concludes with several research directions on user-centred transparency and tailorability.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) telepresence applications and the so-called "metaverse" promise to be the next major medium of interaction with the internet. However, with numerous recent studies showing the ease at which VR users can be profiled, deanonymized, and data harvested, metaverse platforms carry all the privacy risks of the current internet and more while at present having none of the defensive privacy tools we are accustomed to using on the web. To remedy this, we present the first known method of implementing an "incognito mode" for VR. Our technique leverages local differential privacy to quantifiably obscure sensitive user data attributes, with a focus on intelligently adding noise when and where it is needed most to maximize privacy while minimizing usability impact. Moreover, our system is capable of flexibly adapting to the unique needs of each metaverse application to further optimize this trade-off. We implement our solution as a universal Unity (C\#) plugin that we then evaluate using several popular VR applications. Upon faithfully replicating the most well-known VR privacy attack studies, we show a significant degradation of attacker capabilities when using our proposed solution.},

	abstract = {This chapter examines the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to improve human moral reasoning and decision-making. The authors characterize such technologies as artificial ethics assistants (AEAs). The authors focus on just one part of the AI-aided moral improvement question: the case of the individual who wants to improve their morality, where what constitutes an improvement is evaluated by the individual’s own values. The authors distinguish three broad areas in which an individual might think their own moral reasoning and decision-making could be improved: one’s actions, character, or other attributes fall short of one’s values and moral beliefs; one sometimes misjudges or is uncertain about what the right thing to do is, given one’s values; or one is uncertain about some fundamental moral questions or recognizes a possibility that some of one’s core moral beliefs and values are mistaken. The authors sketch why one might think AI tools could be used to support moral improvement in those areas and distinguish two types of assistance: preparatory assistance, including advice and training supplied in advance of moral deliberation, and on-the-spot assistance, including on-the-spot advice and facilitation of moral functioning over the course of moral deliberation. Then, the authors turn to ethical issues that AEAs might raise, looking in particular at three under-appreciated problems posed by the use of AI for moral self-improvement: namely, reliance on sensitive moral data, the inescapability of outside influences on AEAs, and AEA usage prompting the user to adopt beliefs and make decisions without adequate reasons.},

This paper focuses on ethical issues associated with the likely convergence of virtual realities (VR) and social networks (SNs), hereafter VRSNs. We examine a scenario in which a significant segment of the world’s population has a presence in a VRSN. Given the pace of technological development and the popularity of these new forms of social interaction, this scenario is plausible. However, it brings with it ethical problems. Two central ethical issues are addressed: those of privacy and those of autonomy. VRSNs pose threats to both privacy and autonomy. The threats to privacy can be broadly categorized as threats to informational privacy, threats to physical privacy, and threats to associational privacy. Each of these threats is further subdivided. The threats to autonomy can be broadly categorized as threats to freedom, to knowledge and to authenticity. Again, these three threats are divided into subcategories. Having categorized the main threats posed by VRSNs, a number of recommendations are provided so that policy-makers, developers, and users can make the best possible use of VRSNs.},

	abstract = {This survey paper reviews the cybersecurity issues related to augmented reality (AR) applications, especially in context of Telehealth and Emergency Medical Services (EMS). AR systems are considered very valuable in the telehealth and EMS fields. The security and privacy of these systems are critical to protecting medical information and patient privacy. In this article, some security issues that AR systems must address will be discussed. AR systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks during data input, transmission, and output. The data collected by on-device sensors may contain private information. In the data transmission phase, outdated transmission protocols, simple authorization, and lack of security patches will increase data leakage risk. In terms of data-at-rest, failure to protect data can lead to unauthorized data access and modification. Therefore, AR systems should be protected against vulnerabilities to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. More research needs to be done on how to secure AR applications in the telehealth and EMS fields. Providing a secure method of transferring sensitive medical information and patient data using AR systems should help in the future development and adoption of AR devices for EMS and telehealth operations.},

As notoriously data-hungry companies become increasingly involved in VR development, this experimental scenario may soon represent a typical VR user experience. While virtual telepresence applications (and the so-called "metaverse") have recently received increased attention and investment from major tech firms, these environments remain relatively under-studied from a security and privacy standpoint. In this work, we illustrate how VR attackers can covertly ascertain dozens of personal data attributes from seemingly-anonymous users of popular metaverse applications like VRChat. These attackers can be as simple as other VR users without special privilege, and the potential scale and scope of this data collection far exceed what is feasible within traditional mobile and web applications. We aim to shed light on the unique privacy risks of the metaverse, and provide the first holistic framework for understanding intrusive data harvesting attacks in these emerging VR ecosystems.},

Various designs to provide information on Privacy Policy (PP) have improved the awareness and motivation towards privacy risks. However, most of them have focused on desktop environments, not utilizing the full potential of VR’s immersive interactivity. Therefore, we proposed a role-playing mechanism to provide an immersive experience of interacting with PP’s key entities. First, our formative study found insights for PP where VR users had limited awareness of what data to be collected and how to control them. Following this, we implemented a VR privacy tutorial based on our role-playing mechanism and PP from off-the-shelf VR devices. Our privacy tutorial increased a similar amount of privacy awareness with significantly higher satisfaction (p=0.007) than conventional PP. Our tutorial also showed marginally higher usability (p=0.11).},

	abstract = {Social Virtual Reality (social VR or SVR) provides digital spaces for diverse human activities, social interactions, and embodied face-to-face encounters. While our digital bodies in SVR can in general be of almost any conceivable appearance, individualized or even personalized avatars bearing users’ likeness recently became an interesting research topic. Such digital bodies show a great potential to enhance the authenticity of social VR citizens and increase the trustworthiness of interpersonal interaction. However, using such digital bodies might expose users to privacy and identity issues such as identity theft: For instance, how do we know whether the avatars we encounter in the virtual world are who they claim to be? Safeguarding users’ identities and privacy, and preventing harm from identity infringement, are crucial to the future of social VR. This article provides a systematic review on the protection of users’ identity and privacy in social VR, with a specific focus on digital bodies. Based on 814 sources, we identified and analyzed 49 papers that either: 1) discuss or raise concerns about the addressed issues, 2) provide technologies and potential solutions for protecting digital bodies, or 3) examine the relationship between the digital bodies and users of social VR citizens. We notice a severe lack of research and attention on the addressed topic and identify several research gaps that need to be filled. While some legal and ethical concerns about the potential identity issues of the digital bodies have been raised, and despite some progress in specific areas such as user authentication has been made, little research has proposed practical solutions. Finally, we suggest potential future research directions for digital body protection and include relevant research that might provide insights. We hope this work could provide a good overview of the existing discussion, potential solutions, and future directions for researchers with similar concerns. We also wish to draw attention to identity and privacy issues in social VR and call for interdisciplinary collaboration.},

However, traditional code dependency analysis tools detect only direct source code dependencies and can hardly detect code dependency across VR objects. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, VRDepend, to extract code-asset dependency within VR software projects. In particular, we extract (1) the direct association between VR objects and script files, (2) the compositional relations between VR objects, (3) event triggering relations between scripts and VR objects. We evaluated VRDepend based on script dependency extracted from file co-revisions. Our evaluation results show that VRDepend can cover 64\% script file dependencies in historical commits of our subject VR software projects.},

In Section “Plasticity in the Human Mind,” we cover some of the main results suggesting that one’s environment can influence one’s psychological states, as well as recent work on inducing illusions of embodiment. Then, in Section “Illusions of Embodiment and Their Lasting Effect,” we go on to discuss recent evidence indicating that immersion in VR can have psychological effects that last after leaving the virtual environment. In the second part of the article, we turn to the risks and recommendations. We begin, in Section “The Research Ethics of VR,” with the research ethics of VR, covering six main topics: the limits of experimental environments, informed consent, clinical risks, dual-use, online research, and a general point about the limitations of a code of conduct for research. Then, in Section “Risks for Individuals and Society,” we turn to the risks of VR for the general public, covering four main topics: long-term immersion, neglect of the social and physical environment, risky content, and privacy. We offer concrete recommendations for each of these 10 topics, summarized in Table 1.},

Social VR platforms draw aspects from traditional 2D virtual worlds where users engage in various immersive experiences, interactive activities, and choices in avatar-based representation. However, social VR also demonstrates specific nuances that extend traditional 2D virtual worlds and other online social spaces, such as full/partial body tracked avatars, experiencing mundane everyday activities in a new way (e.g., sleeping), and an immersive means to explore new and complex identities. The growing popularity has signaled interest and investment from top technology companies who each have their own social VR platforms. Thus far, social VR has become an emerging research space, mainly focusing on design strategies, communication and interaction modalities, nuanced activities, self-presentation, harassment, privacy, and self-disclosure.

Our findings show that overall, users felt comfortable to disclose their emotions, personal experience, and personal information in social VR.

In this paper, we show that the head, hand and (or) body movement patterns exhibited by a user freely interacting with a VR application contain user-specific information that can be leveraged for user authentication.

Prior works have identified security and privacy risks raised by these technologies, primarily considering individual users or AR devices. However, we make two key observations: (1) users will not always use AR in isolation, but also in ecosystems of other users, and (2) since immersive AR devices have only recently become available, the risks of AR have been largely hypothetical to date. To provide a foundation for understanding and addressing the security and privacy challenges of emerging AR technologies, grounded in the experiences of real users, we conduct a qualitative lab study with an immersive AR headset, the Microsoft HoloLens. We conduct our study in pairs - 22 participants across 11 pairs - wherein participants engage in paired and individual (but physically co-located) HoloLens activities. Through semi-structured interviews, we explore participants' security, privacy, and other concerns, raising key findings. For example, we find that despite the HoloLens's limitations, participants were easily immersed, treating virtual objects as real (e.g., stepping around them for fear of tripping). We also uncover numerous security, privacy, and safety concerns unique to AR (e.g., deceptive virtual objects misleading users about the real world), and a need for access control among users to manage shared physical spaces and virtual content embedded in those spaces. Our findings give us the opportunity to identify broader lessons and key challenges to inform the design of emerging single-and multi-user AR technologies.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) platforms are evolving to support immersive 3D experiences. Most modern AR platforms support only a single immersive app at a time, but users may also benefit from the ability to engage with multiple apps at once. The ability of different apps to simultaneously augment a user's world raises critical questions: how might apps visually conflict with each other, and how can we design AR platforms to support rich behaviors while mediating conflicts? In this work, we pose and explore these questions, identifying means of visual conflict as well as platform design strategies to mediate conflicts. We then analyze state-of-the-art AR platforms (HoloLens, Magic Leap One, and Meta 2) to understand their trade-offs and identify unexplored gaps in the broader design space. Our exploration reveals key guidelines and lessons to inform future multi-app AR efforts.},

Though researchers have begun considering the security, privacy, and safety issues raised by these technologies, to date such efforts have focused on input, i.e., how to limit the amount of private information to which AR applications receive access. In this work, we focus on the challenge of output management: how can an AR operating system allow multiple concurrently running applications to safely augment the user's view of the world? That is, how can the OS prevent apps from (for example) interfering with content displayed by other apps or the user's perception of critical real-world context, while still allowing them sufficient flexibility to implement rich, immersive AR scenarios? We explore the design space for the management of visual AR output, propose a design that balances OS control with application flexibility, and lay out the research directions raised and enabled by this proposal.},

	abstract = {Immersive augmented reality (AR) technologies are becoming a reality. Prior works have identified security and privacy risks raised by these technologies, primarily considering individual users or AR devices. However, we make two key observations: (1) users will not always use AR in isolation, but also in ecosystems of other users, and (2) since immersive AR devices have only recently become available, the risks of AR have been largely hypothetical to date. To provide a foundation for understanding and addressing the security and privacy challenges of emerging AR technologies, grounded in the experiences of real users, we conduct a qualitative lab study with an immersive AR headset, the Microsoft HoloLens. We conduct our study in pairs - 22 participants across 11 pairs - wherein participants engage in paired and individual (but physically co-located) HoloLens activities. Through semi-structured interviews, we explore participants' security, privacy, and other concerns, raising key findings. For example, we find that despite the HoloLens's limitations, participants were easily immersed, treating virtual objects as real (e.g., stepping around them for fear of tripping). We also uncover numerous security, privacy, and safety concerns unique to AR (e.g., deceptive virtual objects misleading users about the real world), and a need for access control among users to manage shared physical spaces and virtual content embedded in those spaces. Our findings give us the opportunity to identify broader lessons and key challenges to inform the design of emerging single-and multi-user AR technologies.},

We find multiple shipping displays suffer from display leakage: an adversary who observes a user wearing the display can reconstruct the contents of the display from light leaked by the “outward-facing” part of the display. We propose defenses against display leakage and analyze them in context of a range of display designs.},

AR applications provide users with immersive virtual experiences by capturing input from a user's surroundings and overlaying virtual output on the user's perception of the real world. These applications enable users to interact with and perceive virtual content in fundamentally new ways. However, the immersive nature of AR applications raises serious security and privacy concerns. Prior work has focused primarily on input privacy risks stemming from applications with unrestricted access to sensor data. However, the risks associated with malicious or buggy AR output remain largely unexplored. For example, an AR windshield application could intentionally or accidentally obscure oncoming vehicles or safety-critical output of other AR applications. In this work, we address the fundamental challenge of securing AR output in the face of malicious or buggy applications. We design, prototype, and evaluate Arya, an AR platform that controls application output according to policies specified in a constrained yet expressive policy framework. In doing so, we identify and overcome numerous challenges in securing AR output.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) applications sense the environment, then render virtual objects on human senses. Examples include smartphone applications that annotate storefronts with reviews and XBox Kinect games that show "avatars" mimicking human movements. No current OS has special support for such applications. As a result, permissions for AR applications are necessarily coarse-grained: applications must ask for access to raw sensor feeds, such as video and audio. These raw feeds expose significant additional information beyond what applications need, including sensitive information such as the user's location, face, or surroundings. Instead of exposing raw sensor data to applications directly, we introduce a new OS abstraction: the recognizer. A recognizer takes raw sensor data as input and exposes higher-level objects, such as a skeleton or a face, to applications. We propose a fine-grained permission system where applications request permissions at the granularity of recognizer objects. We analyze 87 shipping AR applications and find that a set of four core recognizers covers almost all current apps. We also introduce privacy goggles, a visualization of sensitive data exposed to an application. Surveys of 962 people establish a clear "privacy ordering" over recognizers and demonstrate that privacy goggles are effective at communicating application capabilities. We build a prototype on Windows that exposes nine recognizers to applications, including the Kinect skeleton tracker. Our prototype incurs negligible overhead for single applications, while improving performance of concurrent applications and enabling secure offloading of heavyweight recognizer computation.},

In this work, we examine how individuals adjust their behavior when incentivized to avoid the algorithmic prediction of their intent. We present results from a virtual reality task in which gaze, movement, and other physiological signals are tracked. Participants are asked to decide which card to select without an algorithmic adversary anticipating their choice. We find that while participants use a variety of strategies, data collected remains highly predictive of choice (80\% accuracy). Additionally, a significant portion of participants became more predictable despite efforts to obfuscate, possibly indicating mistaken priors about the dynamics of algorithmic prediction.},

While consumers have become accustomed to a degree of data harvesting on the web, the real-time nature of data sharing in the metaverse indicates that privacy concerns are likely to be even more prevalent in the new "Web 3.0." Research into VR privacy has demonstrated that a plethora of sensitive personal information is observable by various would-be adversaries from just a few minutes of telemetry data. On the other hand, we have yet to see VR parallels for many privacy-preserving tools aimed at mitigating threats on conventional platforms. This paper aims to systematize knowledge on the landscape of VR privacy threats and countermeasures by proposing a comprehensive taxonomy of data attributes, protections, and adversaries based on the study of 68 collected publications. We complement our qualitative discussion with a statistical analysis of the risk associated with various data sources inherent to VR in consideration of the known attacks and defenses. By focusing on highlighting the clear outstanding opportunities, we hope to motivate and guide further research into this increasingly important field.},

Since the use of VR typically requires wearing a Head-Mounted Display (HMD), the user is not able to see others - the spectators - present in the same context. This may lead to a decrease of social acceptability of VR by both the users and the spectators. We conducted a field experiment to explore what are the experiential factors of the users of VR (N=10) and spectators of VR use (N=30). We found experiential factors for the users to be adjustment of interaction, uninterruptable immersion, un-intrusive communication, freedom to switch between realities, sense of safety, physical privacy, shared experience, and sense of belonging. For the spectators, the main factors are shared experience, enticing curiosity, feeling normal, and sense of safety. We then run three sessions with user experience (UX) experts (N=9) to create a set of design recommendations for socially acceptable VR. The resulting ten recommendations provide a holistic view to designing acceptable experiences for VR in public spaces.},

	abstract = {Previously, 3D data—particularly, spatial data—have primarily been utilized in the field of geo-spatial analyses, or robot navigation (e.g. self-automated cars) as 3D representations of geographical or terrain data (usually extracted from lidar). Now, with the increasing user adoption of augmented, mixed, and virtual reality (AR/MR/VR; we collectively refer to as MR) technology on user mobile devices, spatial data has become more ubiquitous. However, this ubiquity also opens up a new threat vector for adversaries: aside from the traditional forms of mobile media such as images and video, spatial data poses additional and, potentially, latent risks to users of AR/MR/VR. Thus, in this work, we analyse MR spatial data using various spatial complexity metrics—including a cosine similarity-based, and a Euclidean distance-based metric—as heuristic or empirical measures that can signify the inference risk a captured space has. To demonstrate the risk, we utilise 3D shape recognition and classification algorithms for spatial inference attacks over various 3D spatial data captured using mobile MR platforms: i.e. Microsoft HoloLens, and Android with Google ARCore. Our experimental evaluation and investigation shows that the cosine similarity-based metric is a good spatial complexity measure of captured 3D spatial maps and can be utilised as an indicator of spatial inference risk.},

Privacy Plumber allows the user to learn and understand the volume of data leaving the home and how that data may affect a user’s privacy—in the same physical context as the devices in question, because we visualize the privacy leaks with augmented reality. Privacy Plumber uses ARP spooﬁng to gather aggregate network trafﬁc information and presents it through an overlay on top of the device in an smartphone app. The increased transparency aims to help the user make privacy decisions and mend potential privacy leaks, such as instruct Privacy Plumber on what devices to block, on what schedule (i.e., turn off Alexa when sleeping), etc. Our initial user study with six participants demonstrates participants’ increased awareness of privacy leaks in smart devices, which further contributes to their privacy decisions (e.g., which devices to block).},

In the context of the issues identified, we caution the unregulated and uncritical application of learning analytics to the data that are collected from VR training.},

	abstract = {The recent appearance of low cost virtual reality (VR) technologies – like the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive and the Sony PlayStation VR – and Mixed Reality Interfaces (MRITF) – like the Hololens – is attracting the attention of users and researchers suggesting it may be the next largest stepping stone in technological innovation. However, the history of VR technology is longer than it may seem: the concept of VR was formulated in the 1960s and the first commercial VR tools appeared in the late 1980s. For this reason, during the last 20 years, 100s of researchers explored the processes, effects, and applications of this technology producing 1000s of scientific papers. What is the outcome of this significant research work? This paper wants to provide an answer to this question by exploring, using advanced scientometric techniques, the existing research corpus in the field. We collected all the existent articles about VR in the Web of Science Core Collection scientific database, and the resultant dataset contained 21,667 records for VR and 9,944 for augmented reality (AR). The bibliographic record contained various fields, such as author, title, abstract, country, and all the references (needed for the citation analysis). The network and cluster analysis of the literature showed a composite panorama characterized by changes and evolutions over the time. Indeed, whether until 5 years ago, the main publication media on VR concerned both conference proceeding and journals, more recently journals constitute the main medium of communication. Similarly, if at first computer science was the leading research field, nowadays clinical areas have increased, as well as the number of countries involved in VR research. The present work discusses the evolution and changes over the time of the use of VR in the main areas of application with an emphasis on the future expected VR’s capacities, increases and challenges. We conclude considering the disruptive contribution that VR/AR/MRITF will be able to get in scientific fields, as well in human communication and interaction, as already happened with the advent of mobile phones by increasing the use and the development of scientific applications (e.g., in clinical areas) and by modifying the social communication and interaction among people.},

Additionally, the analysis of eye tracking data allows to assess the cognitive load, intentions and actions of the user. In this work, we propose a person-independent, privacy-preserving and gaze-based cognitive load recognition scheme for drivers under critical situations based on previously collected driving data from a driving experiment in VR including a safety critical situation. Based on carefully annotated ground-truth information, we used pupillary information and performance measures (inputs on accelerator, brake, and steering wheel) to train multiple classifiers with the aim of assessing the cognitive load of the driver. Our results show that incorporating eye tracking data into the VR setup allows to predict the cognitive load of the user at a high accuracy above 80\%. Beyond the specific setup, the proposed framework can be used in any adaptive and intelligent VR/AR application.},

However, it has not yet been brought to light that interactions and interaction data will soon be of concern in terms of privacy. We mediate interactions in everyday life through the maintenance of personal space and allow certain individuals and objects into our personal space. We do the same in virtual reality. Our personal space allows us to preserve our feeling of safety, and the way we mediate it shows our biases and preferences. In this work, we take a look at the implications of interaction and the availability of personal data that will bring a host of ethical and privacy concerns.},

	abstract = {Perceptual Manipulation Attacks (PMA) involve manipulating users’ multi-sensory (e.g., visual, auditory, haptic) perceptions of the world through Mixed Reality (MR) content, in order to influence users’ judgments and following actions. For example, a MR driving application that is expected to show safety-critical output might also (maliciously or unintentionally) overlay the wrong signal on a traffic sign, misleading the user into slamming on the brake. While current MR technology is sufficient to create such attacks, little research has been done to understand how users perceive, react to, and defend against such potential manipulations. To provide a foundation for understanding and addressing PMA in MR, we conducted an in-person study with 21 participants. We developed three PMA in which we focused on attacking three different perceptions: visual, auditory, and situational awareness. Our study first investigates how user reactions are affected by evaluating their performance on “microbenchmark” tasks under benchmark and different attack conditions. We observe both primary and secondary impacts from attacks, later impacting participants’ performance even under non-attack conditions. We follow up with interviews, surfacing a range of user reactions and interpretations of PMA. Through qualitative data analysis of our observations and interviews, we identify various defensive strategies participants developed, and we observe how these strategies sometimes backfire. We derive recom-mendations for future investigation and defensive directions based on our findings.},

We identified issues such as virtual threats leading to physical harm, missing opting-out methods, and amplifying bias through perceptual filters. From the results we establish a collection of prescient challenges relating to security, privacy and behavioural manipulation within XR and present recommendations working towards developing future XR devices that better support security and privacy by default.},

In such dynamic settings with a heterogeneous population of AR users, it is important for holograms to be placed in the surrounding environment with regard to the users' preferences. However, the area of AR personalization remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes to use behavioral cloning, an algorithm for imitation learning, as a means of automatically generating policies that capture user preferences of hologram positioning. We argue in favor of employing the fog computing paradigm to minimize the volume of data sent to the cloud, and thereby preserve user privacy and increase both communication efficiency and learning efficiency. Through preliminary results obtained with a custom, Unity-based AR simulator, we demonstrate that user-specific policies can be learned quickly and accurately.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) technologies are rapidly being adopted across multiple sectors, but little work has been done to ensure the security of such systems against potentially harmful or distracting visual output produced by malicious or bug-ridden applications. Past research has proposed to incorporate manually specified policies into AR devices to constrain their visual output. However, these policies can be cumbersome to specify and implement, and may not generalize well to complex and unpredictable environmental conditions. We propose a method for generating adaptive policies to secure visual output in AR systems using deep reinforcement learning. This approach utilizes a local fog computing node, which runs training simulations to automatically learn an appropriate policy for filtering potentially malicious or distracting content produced by an application. Through empirical evaluations, we show that these policies are able to intelligently displace AR content to reduce obstruction of real-world objects, while maintaining a favorable user experience.},

	abstract = {Almost exactly 10 years ago, in May 2011, we submitted our first paper on security and privacy for emerging augmented reality (AR) systems [15], to the 2011 USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Security (HotSec).1,2 Though the paper was rejected — a revised version later appearing as the cover article of the Communications of the ACM magazine in April 2014 [16] — it launched us on a now 10-year research trajectory anticipating, studying, and designing to mitigate security, privacy, and safety issues in AR (and/or in MR, XR, VR3). Meanwhile, commercial AR/MR/XR/VR platforms have become available and continued to advance, including Google Glass in 2013, the Microsoft HoloLens and the Meta 2 in 2016, the Magic Leap One in 2018, the Microsoft Hololens 2 in 2019, and Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 in 2020.},

	abstract = {In this article, the authors provide a comprehensive overview on three core pillars of metaverse-as-a-service (MaaS) platforms; privacy and security, edge computing, and blockchain technology. The article starts by investigating security aspects for the wireless access to the metaverse. Then it goes through the privacy and security issues inside the metaverse from data-centric, learning-centric, and human-centric points-of-view. The authors address private and secure mechanisms for privatizing sensitive data attributes and securing machine learning algorithms running in a distributed manner within the metaverse platforms. Novel visions and less-investigated methods are reviewed to help mobile network operators and metaverse service providers facilitate the realization of secure and private MaaS through different layers of the metaverse, ranging from the access layer to the social interactions among clients. Later in the article, it has been explained how the paradigm of edge computing can strengthen different aspects of the metaverse. Along with that, the challenges of using edge computing in the metaverse have been comprehensively investigated. Additionally, the paper has comprehensively investigated and analyzed 10 main challenges of MaaS platforms and thoroughly discussed how blockchain technology provides solutions for these constraints. At the final, future vision and directions, such as content-centric security and zero-trust metaverse, some blockchain's unsolved challenges are also discussed to bring further insights for the network designers in the metaverse era.},

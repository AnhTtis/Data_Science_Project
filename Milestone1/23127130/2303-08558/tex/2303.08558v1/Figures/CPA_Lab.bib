  abstract = {In the last decades, many research teams working at Terahertz frequencies focused their efforts on surpassing the diffraction limit. Numerous techniques have been investigated, combining methods existing at optic wavelength with THz system such as Time Domain Spectroscopy. The actual development led on one side to a resolution as high as {$\lambda$}/3000 and one the other side to a video-rate recording. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the history of the field, to describe the different approaches, to give examples of existing applications and to draw the perspective for this research area.},

With (110) oriented crystals, the x or y component of the THz electric field is measured, whereas with a (001) oriented crystal, the z-component is measured. With an estimated spatial resolution of 20 \textmu m, the technique allows us to map the field on a scale, orders of magnitude smaller than the spatial dimensions of these structures. We illustrate the technique by showing results of measurements of the THz electric field in a plane underneath a metal sphere and a single square hole in a metal foil. The technique provides us with a wealth of information on the time-evolution of light fields near metal structures. To cite this article: A.J.L. Adam et al., C. R. Physique 9 (2008).},

The MIR field and a near-infrared probe interact via sum- (SFG) and difference-frequency generation (DFG) in an electro-optic crystal. An intuitive picture based on a phasor representation and rigorous numerical calculations are used for analysis. It turns out that separating photons generated either by SFG or DFG from the local oscillator via spectral filtering leads to a signal purely proportional the MIR intensity envelope. Backgroundfree phase information may be extracted in a spectral window containing both SFG and DFG components and blocking the local oscillator background based on its orthogonal polarization. This variant leads to signal proportional to the square of the MIR field amplitude. It is limited by the finite efficiency of polarization filtering. The Hilbert transform as a conjugate variable to the electric field in the time domain turns out to play a fundamental role for the context discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Zintl phases, containing strongly covalently bonded frameworks with separate ionically bonded ions, have emerged as a critical materials family in which to couple magnetism and strong spin orbit coupling to drive diverse topological phases of matter. Here we report the single-crystal synthesis, magnetic, thermodynamic, transport, and theoretical properties of the Zintl compound EuZn2P2 that crystallizes in the anti-La2O3 P-3m1 structure, containing triangular layers of Eu2+ ions. In-plane resistivity measurements reveal insulating behavior with an estimated band gap of Eg=0.11eV. Specific heat and magnetization measurements indicate antiferromagnetic ordering at TN=23 K. Curie-Weiss analysis of inplane and out-of-plane magnetic susceptibility from T=150-300K yields peff=8.61 for {$\mu$}0H{$\perp$}c and peff=7.74 for {$\mu$}0H//c close to the expected values for the 4f7 J=S=7/2 Eu2+ ion and indicative of weak anisotropy. Below TN, a significant anisotropy of {$\chi\perp$}/{$\chi$}//{$\approx$}2.3 develops, consistent with A-type magnetic order as observed in isostructural analogs and as predicted by the density functional theory calculations reported herein. The positive Weiss temperatures of \texttheta W=19.2 K for {$\mu$}0H{$\perp$}c and \texttheta W=41.9 K for {$\mu$}0H//c show a similar anisotropy and suggest competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Comparing Eu magnetic ordering temperatures across trigonal EuM2X2 (M=divalent metal, X=pnictide) shows that EuZn2P2 exhibits the highest ordering temperature, with variations in TN correlating with changes in expected dipolar interaction strengths within and between layers and independent of the magnitude of electrical conductivity. These results provide experimental validation of the crystochemical intuition that the cation Eu2+ layers and the anionic (M2X2)2- framework can be treated as electronically distinct subunits, enabling further predictive materials design.},

  abstract = {The enhancement of light-matter coupling when light is confined to wavelength scale volumes is useful both for studying small sample volumes and increasing the overall sensing ability. At these length scales, nonradiative interactions are of key interest to which near-field optical techniques may reveal new phenomena facilitating next-generation material functionalities and applications. Efforts to develop novel chemical or biological sensors using metamaterials have yielded innovative ideas in the optical and terahertz frequency range whereby the spatially integrated response over a resonator structure is monitored via the re-radiated or leaked light. But although terahertz waves generally exhibit distinctive response in chemical molecules or biological tissue, there is little absorption for subwavelength size sample and therefore poor image contrast. Here, we introduce a method that spatially resolves the differential near-field phase response of the entire resonator as a spectral fingerprint. By simultaneously probing two metallic ring resonators, where one loaded with the sample of interest, the differential phase response is able to resolve the presence of guest molecules (e.g. methanol) as they are adsorbed or released within the pores of a prototypical porous coordination polymer.},

For its use in nonlinear spectroscopy, the impact of the relatively complex spatial profile for both broadband ({$\sim$}10 THz) and ultra-broadband ({$>$}100 THz) emission needs to be considered, in particular for experiments based on z-scan techniques. Here we apply spatially resolved measurements based on both field autocorrelation and sum-frequency (up-conversion) detection. Based on these results, we present simulations of the ultra-broadband profile during its passage through a focal region. In addition to the inherent features of the emission profile due to the generation mechanism in the plasma filament, we also analyse the role of the semconductor (silicon) wafer typically placed after the plasma to discard the optical pump beams, whose photoexcitation also can play a role in the resultant THz profile.},

The observed 1/ f -type fluctuations are quantitatively very well described by a phenomenological model based on the concept of non-exponential kinetics. The main result is a correlation-induced enhancement of the fluctuations accompanied by a substantial shift of spectral weight to low frequencies in the vicinity of the Mott critical endpoint. This sudden slowing down of the electron dynamics, observed here in a pure Mott system, may be a universal feature of MI transitions. Our findings are compatible with an electronic phase separation in the critical region of the phase diagram and offer an explanation for the not yet understood absence of effective mass enhancement when crossing the Mott transition.},

  abstract = {This review is devoted to the theory of collective and local pinning effects in various disordered nonlinear driven systems. A common feature of both approaches is the emergence of metastability. Although the emphasis is put on charge and spin density waves and magnetic domain walls, the theory also has applications to flux lines and lattices thereof, dislocation lines, adsorbed monolayers and related systems. In the first part of the article we focus on the theory of collective pinning which includes the equilibrium properties of elastic systems with frozen-in disorder as well as the features close to the dynamic depinning transition enforced by an external driving force. At zero temperature and for adiabatic changes of the force, the dynamic depinning transition is continuous, the correlation length is large, the behaviour is dominated by scaling laws with nontrivial static and dynamical critical indices. The application of functional renormalization group methods allows for the detailed description of both equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium properties. The depinning transition is also characterized by the appearance of new scaling laws. Thermal fluctuations smear out this transition and allow for a creep motion of the elastic objects even at small forces. The application of an ac-driving force also destroys the sharp transition which is replaced by a velocity hysteresis.},

The microscopic mechanism accounting for the giant IR peak at frequencies about \textasciitilde{} 40 cm- 1 in the (TaSe4)zI is proposed. The mechanism is based on an assumption about dynamical charge transfer between adjacent CDW periods accompanying their vibration in corresponding normal mode with wave vector equal to that of superstructure. The mechanism is consistent also with the increase in the IR intensity of the peak observed experimentally when heating the (TaSe4)21crystal above the Peierls transition temperature To = 261 K. Critical index of the Peierls transition order parameter determined from the temperature dependence of the phase phonons intensity is found to be about 0.17, consistent with the results of X-ray experiments. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {We investigate the nonlinear wave-mixing in gases between intense, short optical pulses and long-wavelength fields (mid infrared and terahertz). We show numerically that the beating between the sum- and difference-frequency generation components can be isolated in the spectrogram of the interaction, and can be used to sample the electric field oscillations of the long-wavelength pulses. This, in turn, could be employed as a possible characterization method that provides information on the real electric field amplitude. Our numerical model is supported by spectrally resolved measurements of the four-wave mixing signals obtained from the interaction of intense, single-cycle terahertz fields ({$\lambda$} {$>$} 15 \textmu m) and optical pulses ({$\lambda$} 800 nm, 50 fs duration) in air.},

  abstract = {Collective modes are responsible for the emergence of novel quantum phases in topological materials. In the quasi-one dimensional (1D) Weyl semimetal (TaSe4)2I, a charge density wave (CDW) opens band gaps at the Weyl points, thus turning the system into an axionic insulator. Melting the CDW would restore the Weyl phase, but 1D fluctuations extend the gapped regime far above the 3D transition temperature (TCDW = 263 K), thus preventing the investigation of this topological phase transition with conventional spectroscopic methods. Here we use a non-equilibrium approach: we perturb the CDW phase by photoexcitation, and we monitor the dynamical evolution of the band structure by time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. We find that, upon optical excitation, electrons populate the linearly dispersing states at the Fermi level (EF), and fill the CDW gap. The dynamics of both the charge carrier population and the band gap renormalization (BGR) show a fast component with a characteristic time scale of a few hundreds femtoseconds. However, the BGR also exhibits a second slow component on the \textmu s time scale. The combination of an ultrafast response and of persistent changes in the spectral weight at EF, and the resulting sensitivity of the linearly dispersing states to optical excitations, may explain the high performances of (TaSe4)2I as a material for broadband infrared photodetectors.},

Since the first demonstration of THz wave time-domain spectroscopy in the late 80's, there has been a series of significant advances (particularly in recent years) as more intense THz sources and more sensitive detectors provide new opportunities for understanding the basic science in the THz frequency range. Now, the region of the electromagnetic spectrum from 0.3 to 10 THz (1 mm \textendash{} 30 {$\mu$}m wavelength) is a frontier for research in physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and medicine. Ambient air, when excited with intense femtosecond laser beams, exhibits a remarkable ability to generate and detect pulsed THz waves through an optical nonlinear process. The use of air (or selected gases) as a broadband THz wave emitter and THz wave sensor provides superior bandwidth (0.5 - 20 THz at 10\% bandwidth), sensitivity (heterodyne), resolution (},

The temperature dependence of the CDW gap absorption in the mid-IR frequency range is strongly indicative of the important role played by the thermal lattice fluctuation effects. The latter remove the inverse-square-root singularity, expected for the case of the static distorted lattice. In fact, a considerable broadening (i.e., larger than kBT) of the subgap tail absorption is found by increasing the temperature towards TCDW. Moreover, we find that the phase phonon modes also give and important contribution to the disorder parameter, thus being an essential ingredient for the thermal fluctuation effects.}

  abstract = {Organic metals exhibit unusual electronic properties in their charge and spin degrees of freedom that have puzzled physicists for decades. By now this behaviour is established as intrinsic and related to electronic interactions. Like other correlated electron systems, such as heavy fermions or transition-metal oxides, organic conductors are located next to some ordered phase in the spin or charge sectors. Theory predicts quantum fluctuations to become important at low temperatures and quantum critical behaviour present in most physical properties. Here we survey the experimental evidence of quantum criticality in well-established organic model compounds and look for indications of non-Fermi-liquid behaviour.},

The frequencies and frequency shifts of the Raman features and the infrared powder absorption features are measured. The polarized infrared reflectivity of a single crystal, and the intensities of the Raman features, help in assigning symmetries to certain resonances. By comparing these shifts to those calculated using a realistic valence force model the assigment of most of the in-plane fundamental intermolecular vibrational modes, and a few of the out-of-plane ethylene modes is achieved. The force constants are refined to produce excellent overall agreement between the measured and calculated frequencies and isotope shifts.},

We then used these data to help us make a more definitive assignment that has been previously possible of the features in the low-temperature IR conductivity spectra of (BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br. It was also necessary to measure the low-temperature IR conductivity of additional isotopic analogs of BEDT-TTF, namely those containing 13C(6), 13C(2), 34S(8) and d(8). We found, as expected, that the spectra are dominated by the electron-phonon activated totally symmetric (Ag) modes, but also that the nature of the strongest of these, {$\nu$}3(Ag), is changed dramatically in (BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br from what it is in neutral BEDT-TTF. We also found, unexpectedly, that one of the stronger IR features is most likely due to an activated non-totally-symmetric (B3g) mode, instead of a normally IR-active mode, which had been previously assigned, and further that several other (B3g) modes appear to be activated in the IR spectra.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a survey of the status of five active THz imaging modalities which we have developed and investigated during the last few years with the goal to explore their potential for real-time imaging. We start out by introducing a novel waveguide-based all-electronic imaging system which operates at 812 GHz. Its salient feature is a 32-pixel linear detector array heterodyne-operated at the eighth subharmonic. This array in combination with a telescope optics for object distances of 2\textendash 6 m reaches a data acquisition speed suited for real-time imaging. The second system described then is again an all-electronic scanner (now for around 300 GHz), designed for object distances of 8 m, which combines mechanical scanning in vertical direction, synthetic-aperture image generation in horizontal direction, and frequency-modulated continuous-wave sweeping for the depth information. The third and fourth systems follow an optoelectronic approach by relying on several- to multi-pixel parallel electrooptic detection. One imager is based on a pulsed THz-OPO and homodyne detection with a CCD camera, the other on either continuous-wave electronic or femtosecond optoelectronic THz sources and a photonic-mixing device (PMD) camera. The article concludes with a description of the state of the art of imaging with focal-plane arrays based on CMOS field-effect transistors.},

The fundamental ({$\omega$}1) and second harmonic ({$\omega$}2) output of a 30-fs Ti:sapphire amplifier were focused into nitrogen gas and produce phase-stable broadband MIR pulses ({$\omega$}0) by using a four-wave mixing process ({$\omega$}1 + {$\omega$}1 - {$\omega$}2 \textrightarrow{} {$\omega$}0) through filamentation. The spectrum spread from 400 cm-1 to 5500 cm-1, which completely covered the MIR region. The low frequency components were detected by using an electro-optic sampling technique with a gaseous medium. The efficiency of the MIR pulse generation was very sensitive to the delay between the fundamental and second harmonic pulses. It was revealed that the delay dependence of the efficiency came from the interference between two opposite parametric processes, {$\omega$}1 + {$\omega$}1 - {$\omega$}2 \textrightarrow{} {$\omega$}0 and {$\omega$}2 - {$\omega$}1 - {$\omega$}1 \textrightarrow{} {$\omega$}0. The pulse duration was measured as 6.9 fs with cross-correlation frequency-resolved optical gating by using four-wave mixing in nitrogen. The carrier-envelope phase of the MIR pulse was passively stabilized. The instability was estimated as 154 mrad rms in 2.5 h.},

  abstract = {Four-wave difference frequency generation (FWDFG) is a third-order optical parametric process, which is generally explained as {$\omega$}1 + {$\omega$}2 - {$\omega$}3 \textrightarrow{} {$\omega$}4 or {$\omega$}1 - {$\omega$}2 - {$\omega$}3 \textrightarrow{} {$\omega$}4, where three input frequencies are {$\omega$}1, {$\omega$}2, and {$\omega$}3, and the output frequency is {$\omega$}4. Here we report the use of FWDFG for chirped-pulse upconversion (CPU) of an ultrabroadband mid-infrared (MIR) supercontinuum and the application of the technique for MIR spectroscopy. When the CPU technique is used for MIR spectroscopy, ultrashort MIR pulses are converted into visible ones. This way, the spectra can be recorded with a visible spectrometer, which has much higher performance than MIR spectrometers. In the previous experiments, the CPU has been performed by using sum-frequency generation (SFG) with a solid crystal, and the bandwidth has been limited to less than 1000 cm-1 due to the phase matching condition of the SFG. This limitation can be removed by using FWDFG, which is a third-order nonlinear process that allows us to use centrosymmetric nonlinear media such as gases for the upconversion. Since gaseous media have much less dispersion than solid media, the bandwidth of the phase-matching condition for the upconversion process becomes very broad. In our experiments, the entire spectrum of the MIR supercontinuum spanning from 200 to 5500 cm-1 was upconverted by using a 4.9 ps chirped pulse to visible wavelength radiation, which was detected with a conventional visible dispersive spectrometer. The technique has been applied to attenuated total reflectance MIR spectroscopy. Absorption spectra of liquids in the range from 200 to 5500 cm-1 were measured with a visible spectrometer on a single-shot basis.},

  abstract = {The Mott metal-insulator transition, a paradigm of strong electron-electron correlations, has been considered as a source of intriguing phenomena. Despite its importance for a wide range of materials, fundamental aspects of the transition, such as its universal properties, are still under debate. We report detailed measurements of relative length changes {$\Delta$}               L               /               L               as a function of continuously controlled helium-gas pressure               P               for the organic conductor {$\kappa$}-(BEDT-TTF)               2               Cu[N(CN)               2               ]Cl across the pressure-induced Mott transition. We observe strongly nonlinear variations of {$\Delta$}               L               /               L               with pressure around the Mott critical endpoint, highlighting a breakdown of Hooke's law of elasticity. We assign these nonlinear strain-stress relations to an intimate, nonperturbative coupling of the critical electronic system to the lattice degrees of freedom. Our results are fully consistent with mean-field criticality, predicted for electrons in a compressible lattice with finite shear moduli. We argue that the Mott transition for all systems that are amenable to pressure tuning shows the universal properties of an isostructural solid-solid transition.},

Considering the rather unusual optical properties of the TCNQ crystals, we carefully evaluated Roth Raman and infrared spectral predictions in terms of the oriented gas model. The Raman polarization data led to an almost complete assignment of the g intramolecular fundamentals. The discordant assignments of the infrared absorption spectra previously reported by different authors are reconciled in this work by removing some remarkable discrepancies in the attribution of the symmetry species. As a result, 43 out of 50 optically active vibrational modes of both TCNQ and TCNQ-d4 have found a well based and definite attribution. The frequencies of the in-plane normal modes were calculated using a 26 parameter Valence Force Field. Generally they were in very good agreement with the observed ones. The rather complicated spectral features of the low frequency region could be only partially interpreted by proposing the assignment of the six librational modes and of some low frequency intramolecular fundamentals.},

We will restrict the review to laser based intense few-cycle THz sources, and thus will not include sources such as synchrotron-based or narrowband sources. We will first review the various methods used for generating intense THz radiation, including photoconductive antennas (PCAs), optical rectification sources (especially the tilted-pulse-front lithium niobate source and the DAST source, but also those using other crystals), air plasma THz sources and relativistic laser\textendash plasma sources. Next, we will give a brief introduction on the common methods for coherent THz detection techniques (namely the PCA technique and the electro-optic sampling), and point out the limitations of these techniques for measuring intense THz radiation. We will then review three techniques that are highly suited for detecting intense THz radiation, namely the air breakdown coherent detection technique, various single-shot THz detection techniques, and the spectral-domain interferometry technique. Finally, we will give an overview of the various applications that have been made possible with such intense THz sources, including nonlinear THz spectroscopy of condensed matter (optical-pump/ THz-probe, THz-pump/THz-probe, THz-pump/optical-probe), nonlinear THz optics, resonant and non-resonant control of material (such as switching of superconductivity, magnetic and polarization switching) and controlling the nonlinear response of metamaterials. We will also provide a short perspective on the future of intense THz sources and their applications.},

With an 85 fs pulse amplified laser, we demonstrate a usable bandwidth from 0.5 THz to 12 THz, together with a peak dynamic range (DR) better than 2000:1 and a peak THz electrical field greater than 30 kV/cm. With a 32 fs pulse amplified laser, the usable bandwidth is remarkably expanded to a continuous 35 THz. Several farinfrared optical properties in various samples are reported. Furthermore, the time-resolved optical pump-THz probe experiment is performed.

The duration of the MIR pulse is 13.7 fs, which corresponds to 0.402 cycles. The absolute value of the CEP of the generated sub-half-cycle pulse is consistent with a simple four-wave difference frequency generation model. We have also found that the 10 kHz repetition rate of the light source causes the fluctuation of the pulse energy on a few hundred millisecond time scale.},

  abstract = {Hot carrier cooling in few-layer and multilayer epitaxial graphene on SiC, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown graphene transferred onto a glass substrate was investigated by transient absorption spectroscopy and imaging. Coupling to the substrate was found to play a critical role in charge carrier cooling. For both multilayer epitaxial graphene and monolayer CVD graphene, charge carriers transfer heat predominantly to intrinsic in-plane optical phonons of graphene. At high pump intensity, a significant number of optical phonons are accumulated, and the optical phonon lifetime presents a bottleneck for charge carrier cooling. This hot phonon effect did not occur in few-layer epitaxial graphene because of strong coupling to the substrate, which provided additional cooling channels. The limiting charge carrier lifetimes at high excitation densities were 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.1 ps and 1.4 {$\pm$} 0.1 ps for multilayer epitaxial graphene and monolayer CVD graphene, respectively. These values represent lower limits on the optical phonon lifetime for the graphene samples.},

While for Cl- and Br-containing salts the influence of both parameters were investigated and a universal phase diagram was proposed, the position of \$\textbackslash kappa\$-(BEDT-TTF)\$\_2\$Cu[N(CN)\$\_2\$]I is still not settled. Here we have conducted transport, infrared, and dielectric measurements on single crystals of the title compound to clarify its electronic state at low temperatures. The correlation strength was determined as \$U/W \textbackslash approx 2.2\$; thus this salt is placed deeper in an insulating state compare to the two sister compounds. We found that inherent disorder leads to a Coulomb localized insulating state similar to the moderately x-ray-irradiated \$\textbackslash kappa\$-(BEDT-TTF)\$\_2\$Cu[N(CN)\$\_2\$]Cl.},

Molecular materials are playgrounds suitable for this study. Fundamentals in physics of Mott transition and spin frustration on triangular lattices are seen in the organic materials ET and Pd(dmit)2 compounds. We review the experimental studies on the criticality of Mott transition with a continuously controllable pressure technique and on the ground state of the quasi-triangular-lattice Mott insulator. Mott criticality is well characterized in both charge and spin channels with unconventional critical exponents of possibly quantum nature. The ground state of the triangular-lattice Mott insulator is changed from antiferromagnet to spin liquid as the triangular lattice becomes more isotropic. The various experiments probing the nature of spin liquid are described in the light of proposed mechanisms.},

Negative terahertz photoconductivity reveals a plethora of fascinating ultrafast processes involving photoexcited states and unveil their unique intrinsic characteristics.

Diverse topics such as general theory of phase transitions, harmonic and anharmonic lattices, Bose condensation and superfluidity, modern aspects of magnetism including resonating valence bonds, electrons in metals, and strong electron correlations are treated using unifying concepts of order and elementary excitations. The main theoretical tools used to treat these problems are introduced and explained in a simple way, and their applications are demonstrated through concrete examples.},

  abstract = {Accurate computational predictions of band gaps are of practical importance to the modeling and development of semiconductor technologies, such as (opto)electronic devices and photoelectrochemical cells. Among available electronic-structure methods, density-functional theory (DFT) with the Hubbard U correction (DFT+U) applied to band edge states is a computationally tractable approach to improve the accuracy of band gap predictions beyond that of DFT calculations based on (semi)local functionals. At variance with DFT approximations, which are not intended to describe optical band gaps and other excited-state properties, DFT+U can be interpreted as an approximate spectral-potential method when U is determined by imposing the piecewise linearity of the total energy with respect to electronic occupations in the Hubbard manifold (thus removing self-interaction errors in this subspace), thereby providing a (heuristic) justification for using DFT+U to predict band gaps. However, it is still frequent in the literature to determine the Hubbard U parameters semiempirically by tuning their values to reproduce experimental band gaps, which ultimately alters the description of other total-energy characteristics. Here, we present an extensive assessment of DFT+U band gaps computed using self-consistent ab initio U parameters obtained from density-functional perturbation theory to impose the aforementioned piecewise linearity of the total energy. The study is carried out on 20 compounds containing transition-metal or p-block (group III-IV) elements, including oxides, nitrides, sulfides, oxynitrides, and oxysulfides. By comparing DFT+U results obtained using nonorthogonalized and orthogonalized atomic orbitals as Hubbard projectors, we find that the predicted band gaps are extremely sensitive to the type of projector functions and that the orthogonalized projectors give the most accurate band gaps, in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. This work demonstrates that DFT+U may serve as a useful method for high-throughput workflows that require reliable band gap predictions at moderate computational cost.},

Away from the immediate focal region we observe a sharp, conical intensity profile resembling a donut, and in the focal region the beam collapses to a central, Lorentz-shaped profile. The Lorentzian intensity profile in the focal region can be explained by considering the frequency-dependent spot size derived from measurements of the Gouy phase shift in the focal region, and the transition from the donut profile to a central peak is consistent with propagation of a Bessel\textendash Gauss beam, as shown by simulations based on a recent transient photocurrent model (You et al 2012 Phys.

These aberrations are avoided in the proposed new setup, which employs two concave mirrors in a Keplerian telescope arrangement as the imaging sequence. This partially compensates spherical aberrations and results in a ca. six times higher conversion efficiency in the case of 35-fs optical pump pulse duration compared to the single-lens setup. A THz field strength of 60 kV/cm was obtained using 0.5 mJ pump pulses. The divergence of the THz beam has been found experimentally to depend on the pump imaging scheme employed.},

  abstract = {Recently, air plasma, produced by focusing an intense laser beam to ionize atoms or molecules, has been demonstrated to be a promising source of broadband terahertz waves. However, simultaneous broadband and coherent detection of such broadband terahertz waves is still challenging. Electro-optical sampling and photoconductive antennas are the typical approaches for terahertz wave detection. The bandwidth of these detection methods is limited by the phonon resonance or carrier's lifetime. Unlike solid-state detectors, gaseous sensors have several unique features, such as no phonon resonance, less dispersion, no Fabry-Perot effect, and a continuous renewable nature. The aim of this article is to review the development of a broadband terahertz time-domain spectrometer, which has both a gaseous emitter and sensor mainly based on author's recent investigation. This spectrometer features high efficiency, perceptive sensitivity, broad bandwidth, adequate signal-to-noise ratio, sufficient dynamic range, and controllable polarization.},

  abstract = {Scattering-type scanning near-field microscopy (s-SNOM) at terahertz (THz) frequencies could become a highly valuable tool for studying a variety of phenomena of both fundamental and applied interest, including mobile carrier excitations or phase transitions in 2D materials or exotic conductors. Applications, however, are strongly challenged by the limited signal-to-noise ratio. One major reason is that standard atomic force microscope (AFM) tips, which have made s-SNOM a highly practical and rapidly emerging tool, provide weak scattering efficiencies at THz frequencies. Here, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study of commercial and custom-made AFM tips of different apex diameter and length, in order to understand signal formation in THz s-SNOM and to provide insights for tip optimization. Contrary to common beliefs, we find that AFM tips with large (micrometer-scale) apex diameter can enhance s-SNOM signals by more than 1 order of magnitude, while still offering a spatial resolution in the 100 nm range at a wavelength of {$\lambda$} = 119 {$\mu$}m. On the other hand, exploiting the increase of sSNOM signals with tip length, we succeeded in sub-15 nm ({$<\lambda$}/8000) resolved THz imaging employing a tungsten tip with 6 nm apex radius. We explain our findings and provide novel insights into s-SNOM via rigorous numerical modeling of the nearfield scattering process. Our findings will be of critical importance for pushing THz nanoscopy to its ultimate limits regarding sensitivity and spatial resolution.},

Recent discoveries, such as the optical enhancement of the critical temperature in certain superconductors and the photo-stabilization of hidden phases, have turned this field into an important research frontier. Here, we demonstrate nonthermal charge-density-wave (CDW) order at electronic temperatures far greater than the thermodynamic transition temperature. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and time-resolved X-ray diffraction, we investigate the electronic and structural order parameters of an ultrafast photoinduced CDW-to-metal transition. Tracking the dynamical CDW recovery as a function of electronic temperature reveals a behaviour markedly different from equilibrium, which we attribute to the suppression of lattice fluctuations in the transient nonthermal phonon distribution. A complete description of the system's coherent and incoherent order-parameter dynamics is given by a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau framework, providing access to the transient potential energy surfaces.},

The latter two compounds were located near the metal\textendash insulator boundary in the dimer-Mott phase diagram. From the comparison of the temperature dependences of their heat capacities, we indicated that lattice heat capacities of the partially deuterated compounds were larger than that of the pristine compound below about 40 K. This feature probably related to the lattice softening was discussed also by the sound velocity measurement, in which the dip-like structures of the {$\increment$}v/v were observed. We also discussed the variation of the electronic heat capacity under magnetic fields. From the heat capacity data at magnetic fields up to 6 T, we evaluated that the normal-state {$\gamma$} value of the partially deuterated compound, {$\kappa$}-(d[3,3]-BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br, was about 3.1 mJ K-2 mol-1. Under the magnetic fields higher than 3.0 T, we observed that the magnetic-field insulating state was induced due to the instability of the mid-gap electronic state peculiar for the two-dimensional dimer-Mott system. Even though the volume fraction was much reduced, the heat capacity of {$\kappa$}-(d[3,3]-BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br showed a small hump structure probably related to the strong coupling feature of the superconductivity near the boundary.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive ellipsometric study was performed on Fe\$\_\{1-x\}\$Co\$\_\{x\}\$Si single crystals in the spectral range from 0.01 eV to 6.2 eV. Direct and indirect band gaps of 73 meV and 10 meV, respectively, were observed in FeSi at 7 K. One of four infrared-active phonons that is energetically close to the direct absorption edge is coupled both to the electrons and to the low-energy phonon. This is evident from asymmetry in the phonon line shape and a reduction of its frequency when the absorption edge shifts across the phonon energy due to the temperature dependence of the direct band gap. As the temperature increases, the indirect gap changes sign, which manifests as a transition from a semiconductor to a semimetal. The corresponding gain of the spectral weight at low energies was recovered within an energy range of several eV. The present findings strongly support the model indicating that Fe\$\_\{1-x\}\$Co\$\_\{x\}\$Si can be well described in an itinerant picture, taking into account self-energy corrections.},

  abstract = {Fluctuation spectroscopy measurements of quasi-two-dimensional organic charge-transfer salts (BEDT-TTF)2X are reviewed. In the past decade, the method has served as a new approach for studying the low-frequency dynamics of strongly correlated charge carriers in these materials. We review some basic aspects of electronic fluctuations in solids, and give an overview of selected problems where the analysis of 1/ f -type fluctuations and the corresponding slow dynamics provide a better understanding of the underlying physics. These examples are related to (1) an inhomogeneous current distribution due to phase separation and/or a percolative transition; (2) slow dynamics due to a glassy freezing either of structural degrees of freedom coupling to the electronic properties or (3) of the electrons themselves, e.g., when residing on a highly-frustrated crystal lattice, where slow and heterogeneous dynamics are key experimental properties for the vitrification process of a supercooled charge-liquid. Another example is (4), the near divergence and critical slowing down of charge carrier fluctuations at the finite-temperature critical endpoint of the Mott metal-insulator transition. Here also indications for a glassy freezing and temporal and spatial correlated dynamics are found. Mapping out the region of ergodicity breaking and understanding the influence of disorder on the temporal and spatial correlated fluctuations will be an important realm of future studies, as well as the fluctuation properties deep in the Mott or charge-ordered insulating states providing a connection to relaxor or ordered ferroelectric states studied by dielectric spectroscopy.},

Most of their physical properties are closely related to carrier dynamics, which can be directly observed by ultrafast optical measurements in their nonequilibrium states. Time-resolved temperature-dependent reflectivity changes were measured on single crystals of an isostructural pair of organic charge transfer salts  -(ET)2Cu[N(CN)2]X, which are ambient- (X {$\frac{1}{4}$} Br) or high-pressure (X {$\frac{1}{4}$} Cl) superconductors. The latter compound in its ground state is a Mott insulator under ambient pressure. The obtained temperature dependences of relaxation times for both salts indicated the existence of an intermediate electronic state between those of metals and insulators at all measurement temperatures. Such an unusual electronic state coexisted with the superconducting and Mott insulating states in X {$\frac{1}{4}$} Br and X {$\frac{1}{4}$} Cl, respectively. In addition, the results for X {$\frac{1}{4}$} Br revealed the formation of a temperature-dependent well-defined gap in the superconducting transition, while those for X {$\frac{1}{4}$} Cl suggested that the Mott transition in this salt does not depend on electron\textendash phonon interactions, consistent with the theory that the Mott transition should originate from electron correlation.},

At first, we explain structural and electronic features originated from rigid dimerization in donor arrangement in 2D layers. The antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase located at low-pressure region in the phase diagram shows vanishing {$\gamma$} electronic heat capacity coefficient in the heat capacity, which claims opening of a charge-gap in this insulating state. Then, a systematic change of the {$\gamma$} around the Mott boundary region is reported in relation to the glass freezing of ethylene dynamics. The thermodynamic parameters determined by {$\increment$}Cp/{$\gamma$}Tc of 10 K class superconductors, {$\kappa$}-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2 and {$\kappa$}-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br demonstrate that a rather large gap with a strong coupling character appears around the Fermi-surface. On the other hand, the low temperature heat capacity clearly shows a picture of nodal-gap structure due to an anisotropic pairing. The comparison with lower Tc compounds in the {$\kappa$}-type structure is also performed so as to discuss overall features of the {$\kappa$}-type superconductors. The heat capacity measurements of hole-doped systems containing mercury in the counteranions show an anomalous enhancement of {$\gamma$}, which is consistent with the T1-1 of NMR experiments etc. The results of heat capacity measurements under high pressures are also reported.},

Thanks to the low dispersion of the gas media, the bandwidth of the phase matching condition of the upconversion process becomes very broad and the entire mid-infrared spectrum spanning from 200 to 5500 cm-1 was upconverted by using a 10 ps chirped pulse to visible wavelength radiation, which was detected with a conventional visible dispersive spectrometer.

We have obtained real-time visualizations of the spatial evolution of THz electromagnetic waves interacting with a single metal micro-helix. After the micro-helix is stimulated by a broadband pico-second pulse of THz electromagnetic waves, two types of anisotropic re-emissions can occur following overall inductive current oscillations in the micro-helix. They propagate in orthogonally crossed directions with different THz frequency spectra. This unique radiative feature can be very useful for the development of a smart antenna with broadband multiplexing/demultiplexing ability and directional adaptivity. In this way, we have demonstrated that our advanced measurement techniques can lead to the development of novel functional THz devices.},

Breast cancer is a generic name for a heterogeneous lesion comprising invasive adenocarcinoma,               in situ               adenocarcinoma, most frequently in the form of ductal carcinoma               in situ               (DCIS) and benign tissues. Until now, THz imaging has focused on invasive adenocarcinoma; however, THz analysis of DCIS has hardly been performed. One of the reasons is that the size of an individual DCIS lesion, ranging from 50 to 500               \textmu{}               m, is typically much smaller than that of an invasive carcinoma. This makes it difficult to identify these lesions by THz imaging, which has only a diffraction-limited spatial resolution of several millimeters. To overcome this drawback, we have developed a scanning point terahertz source (SPoTS) microscope with a resolution of 20               \textmu{}               m, in which a near-infrared-pump-laser-induced two-dimensionally-scannable point THz source (               {$\varphi$}               THz               {$\approx$}               {$\varphi$}               Pump               ) generated in a GaAs crystal contacts a sample. In this study, utilizing this state-of-the-art microscope, we mainly performed THz near-field transmission imaging of a paraffin-embedded human breast cancer sample containing invasive carcinoma and DCIS, as a preliminary study. Consequently, for the first time, we succeeded in clearly visualizing a DCIS lesion of {$\sim$}               {$\varphi$}               500               \textmu{}               m in the THz images. It was also found that the THz attenuation by DCIS was higher than that by invasive ductal carcinoma. Furthermore, also in a reflection-mode measurement, we successfully obtained a similar outcome to the above transmission-mode one. These results can be caused by the interaction between the THz waves and the cellular density, indicating that SPoTS microscopy may be suitable for DCIS diagnosis.},

We discuss two concepts of fully coherent coupling of phase-locked THz pulses with condensed matter. The first approach demonstrates two-dimensional multi-THz spectroscopy of the semiconductor material InSb. By phase- and amplitude-sensitive detection of the nonlinear optical response, we are able to separate incoherent pump\textendash probe signals from coherent four-wave mixing and reveal extremely non-perturbative nonlinearities. While this class of interactions is mediated by the electric field component of the THz pulse, the second approach is complementary, as it demonstrates that, alternatively, the magnetic THz field may be exploited to selectively control the spin degree of freedom in antiferromagnetic NiO.},

  abstract = {Organic layered charge-transfer salts {$\kappa$}-(BEDT-TTF)2X form highly frustrated lattices of molecular dimers in which strong correlations give rise to Mott insulating states situated close to the metal-to-insulator phase boundary. The salts {$\kappa$}-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3 and {$\kappa$}-(BEDT-TTF)2Ag2(CN)3 have been considered as prime candidates for a quantum spin liquid, while {$\kappa$}-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Cl has been suggested as a prototypical charge-order-driven antiferromagnet. In this paper, we summarize and discuss several key results, including some not reported previously, obtained in search to clarify the competition of these two ground states. The origin of anomalous dielectric response found at low temperatures in all three salts is also discussed. We conclude by pointing out the relevant new insights into the role of frustration and random disorder in the suppression of magnetic ordering and formation of the spin liquid state.},

Recent diffraction studies demonstrated the existence of two types of periodic lattice distortions above and below the triclinic phase transition, suggesting the existence of an unconventional charge-density-wave (CDW) order. The suppression of CDW order upon doping results in a sixfold increase in the superconducting transition temperature and enhanced nematic fluctuations, suggesting CDW is competing with superconductivity.

  abstract = {We review the role of strong electronic correlations in quasi-two-dimensional organic charge transfer salts such as (BEDT-TTF)2X, (BETS)2Y, and {$\beta$} [Pd(dmit)2]2Z. We begin by defining minimal models for these materials. It is necessary to identify two classes of material: the first class is strongly dimerized and is described by a half-filled Hubbard model; the second class is not strongly dimerized and is described by a quarter-filled extended Hubbard model. We argue that these models capture the essential physics of these materials. We explore the phase diagram of the half-filled quasi-two-dimensional organic charge transfer salts, focusing on the metallic and superconducting phases. We review work showing that the metallic phase, which has both Fermi liquid and `bad metal' regimes, is described both quantitatively and qualitatively by dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The phenomenology of the superconducting state is still a matter of contention. We critically review the experimental situation, focusing on the key experimental results that may distinguish between rival theories of superconductivity, particularly probes of the pairing symmetry and measurements of the superfluid stiffness. We then discuss some strongly correlated theories of superconductivity, in particular the resonating valence bond (RVB) theory of superconductivity. We conclude by discussing some of the major challenges currently facing the field. These include parameterizing minimal models, the evidence for a pseudogap from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, superconductors with low critical temperatures and extremely small superfluid stiffnesses, the possible spin-liquid states in {$\kappa$}-(ET)2Cu2(CN)3 and {$\beta$} -[Pd(dmit)2]2Z, and the need for high quality large single crystals.},

The temporal resolution provided by few-femtosecond laser pulses results in a bandwidth exceeding 100 THz, potentially covering the entire infrared spectral range. A pedagogic introduction to the operational principle of the method is given along the lines of a classical coherent input field and a zincblende-type electrooptic sensor. We then show that even the bare vacuum fluctuations of the electric field in the quantum ground state may be detected. This time-domain approach to quantum physics operates directly on sub-cycle scales where no local energy conservation holds.

In addition to the relaxor-like dielectric behavior seen below 50 K at p=0, that moves toward lower temperatures with pressure, a second peak emerges in {$\varepsilon$}1(T) around T=15 K. When approaching the insulator-metal boundary, this peak diverges rapidly reaching {$\varepsilon$}1{$\approx$}105. Our dynamical mean-field theory calculations substantiate that the dielectric catastrophe at the Mott transition is not caused by closing the energy gap, but due to the spatial coexistence of correlated metallic and insulating regions. We discuss the percolative nature of the first-order Mott insulator-to-metal transition in all details.}

We discuss the observed vibrational features in terms of the CDW ground state accompanied by a change in the crystal symmetry. A frequency-kink in some modes seen in K0.3MoO3 between T = 80 and 100 K supports the first-order lock-in transition, unlike the case of Rb0.3MoO3. The unusually sharp Raman lines (limited by the instrumental response) at very low temperatures and their temperature evolution suggests that the decay of the low-energy phonons is strongly influenced by the presence of the temperaturedependent CDW gap.},

The temperature dependence of the intensity of the superlattice reflection is found to be approximately described by a simple equation. A phonon mode seems to have an almost complete softening at the transition temperature T,. The existence of the large central peak in the inelastic spectra above T,suggests that the local correlation between electrons is very strong. The wavevector of the charge density wave smoothly approaches the commensurate one, as the temperature is lowered and lock-in transition does not occur down to T = 6 K.},

  abstract = {Carrier and collective mode dynamics in the quasi onedimensional charge density wave (CDW) system (TaSe4)2I have been investigated by means of time-resolved optical pump-probe spectroscopy. In the low excitation, linear, regime we focus on the temperature dependence of the collective amplitude modes, originating from linear coupling of the electronic modulation to phonons at qCDW. Numerous amplitude modes are observed, ranging from 100 GHz to several THz. The modes' softening near Tc is rather weak, which could be related to strong decoupling of electronic and lattice subsystems. Alternatively, the data could be reconciled also in case the CDW phase transition is of the first-order type where a nearly constant order parameter below Tc would prevent softening. In the high excitation regime we investigated the energetics of the photoinduced CDW-normal phase transition. Similarly to the elaborately investigated one-dimensional CDW system K0.3MoO3 we observe two characteristic energy scales, related to melting the electronic modulation alone (100 meV per unit cell) and to the overall (electronic modulation and the periodic lattice distortion) collapse of the CDW ({$>$} 400 meV per unit cell). While the latter coincides with the thermal energy needed to heat the sample from 5 K above Tc the former is consistent with the mean field estimate for the electronic condensation energy, suggesting that the weak coupling description of the CDW in (TaSe4)2I is appropriate.},

The final Re = 0.033 for 7985 reflections for the K bronze and 0.032 for 4458 reflections for the Rb bronze. In the modulated structure, valence calculations show that the phase transition to the semiconductor state is accompanied by ordering of Mo 5+ along the infinite-chain direction. The metallic conductivity, with delocalization of 4d electrons between clusters by overlapping Mo-O-Mo orbitals along the infinite-chain direction, turns into semiconductor properties by localization of 4d electrons on individual Mo(2) and Mo(3) octahedra (not on Mol0030 clusters as a whole), modulated with wavevector q. By a comparison of the structures of the blue and red bronzes, their physical properties can be interpreted.},

In this system, THz wave pulses locally generated at the laser irradiation spots transmit through the sample set on the emitter, and the amplitude of the transmitted THz wave pulse is detected by using a typical THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) technique. Using this system, we have succeeded in obtaining THz transmission images of a triangle shaped metal sheet of millimeter-size and a human hair sample with a spatial resolution of sub-wavelength order up to \textasciitilde 27\textmu m (\textasciitilde{$\lambda$}THz/28) at an imaging speed of about 47 seconds/image for 512 x 512 pixels.},

Furthermore, the comparison of the fsTRS data obtained in thin films and in single crystals shows the reduction of the charge density wave transition temperature and of the photoinduced signal strength in granular thin films with respect to single crystals, which is attributed to the granularity and crystal growth morphology.

  abstract = {Charge density waves (CDWs), i.e. the periodic spatial modulation of coupled electronic and lattice density, are ubiquitous in low-dimensional conductors and have taken on renewed relevance due their role in state-of-the-art materials, e.g. high-Tcsuperconductors, topological insulators and low-dimensional carbon. As CDWs are described by a complex order parameter to represent both the amplitude and phase, they are formally analogous to BCS superconductors and spin-waves, providing a prototype of collective phenomena for the further development of field theories and ab-initio calculations of complex solids. The low-energy excitations are mixed electron-phonon quanta which ideally separate into an amplitude and phase channel, and provide a sensitive probe of the ground state and non-equilibrium dynamics, including ultrafast photoinduced phase transitions. While recent studies of the amplitude modes have brought substantial progress aided by a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau framework, we focus here on the phase modes using ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy. Experiments on K0.3MoO3 provide a more complete picture, and reveal a high sensitivity to interactions with impurities and screening effects from photogenerated carriers, both of which can be accounted for by generalizations of the model. Moreover, our considerations emphasize the need to revisit the treatment of inherent electronic damping in quantum-mechanical CDW theories.},

  abstract = {We investigate the broadband dielectric properties of vertically aligned, multi-wall carbon nanotubes (VACNT), over both the terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared spectral ranges. The nominally undoped, metallic VACNT samples are probed at normal incidence, i.e. the response is predominantly due to polarisation perpendicular to the CNT axis. A detailed comparison of various conductivity models and previously reported results is presented for the non-Drude behaviour we observe in the conventional THz range (up to 2.5 THz). Extension to the mid-infrared range reveals an absorption peak at {$\sim$}24 THz, reminiscent of that observed in single-wall CNT, only there it arises for polarisation parallel to the CNT axis. To account for the observed resonance here, we apply a Bergman-type effective-medium theory, based on first-principles' electromagnetic simulations for the perpendicular polarisation including both the intra- and inter-tube response, which can reproduce the observed spectrum if one assumes a much higher plasma frequency and scattering rate than that reflected in the low-frequency spectra, and proposes an explanation for the non-Drude behaviour at low-frequencies.},

  abstract = {In this work, spectrally resolved optical pump-probe measurements were carried out on strongly correlated organic superconductor {$\kappa$}-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br. We find two different types of carrier relaxation dynamics, one of which appears at 1.82 eV and 1.94 eV, and another at 2.17 eV. The former is characterized by short decay time {$\sim$} 1\textendash 2 ps and appears below {$\sim$} 60 K. From the comparison with the previous studies, the dynamics arises from the photo-induced pseudogap (PG) formation of the partially appeared Mott phase. The latter has long relaxation time {$\sim$} 9 ps at 5 K and developed as temperature decreases below 30 K. The slow dynamics is consistent with appearance of superconducting (SC) gap. Such separate observation of PG and SC dynamics enables us to proceed further investigation of a relationship between them.},

Physical parameters of the model, such as the energy of Coulomb repulsion between two electrons (holes) in one molecule, the transfer integrals between molecules inside the dimer and between dimers, and the electron\textendash molecular vibration coupling constants, are determined. The anisotropy of the spectra in the conducting plane is explained. The inference is made that only electrons localized on clusters couple with intramolecular vibrations.},

It has been established that the parameters characterizing the charge transfer between molecules in dimers and tetramers and the vibronic coupling constants are almost identical for the compounds under investigation. A large value of the effective Coulomb repulsion (U/t = 1.3\textendash 1.5) indi cates that strong electron correlations occur in the compounds both with a metal\textendash insulator phase transition (x = 0, 0.40) and with a metal\textendash superconductor phase transition (x = 0.85, 0.90). The conclusion has been drawn that, at x = 0, electron correlations favor an antiferromagnetic spin ordering and a metal\textendash insulator phase transition, whereas for superconductors (x = 0.85, 0.90), the metal\textendash insulator phase transition is hin dered as a result of the structural disorder due to the difference in orientations of the terminal CH2 groups of the BEDT\textendash TTF molecule. It has been shown that quasi free charge carriers interact with electrons localized on the clusters and do not interact with intramolecular vibrations. It has been noted that the oscillator strength of the observed electronic transitions in the initial metallic band (Neff = 0.38\textendash 0.31 per dimer) is con siderably less than the corresponding value for free (noninteracting) charge carriers (N = 1). This suggests that the Coulomb correlations and vibronic coupling play a decisive role in the kinetic phenomena observed in the molecular conductors and superconductors under investigation.},

While the standard Sellmeier equation (SSE) for atmospheric air is not intended for the description of air refractivity in the mid-infrared and long-wavelength infrared, failing beyond, roughly 2.5\,{$\mu$}m, our generalization of this equation is shown to agree remarkably well with full-scale air-refractivity calculations involving over half a million atmospheric absorption lines, providing a highly accurate description of air refractivity in the range of wavelengths from 0.3 to 13\,{$\mu$}m. With its validity range being substantially broader than the applicability range of the SSE and its accuracy being at least an order of magnitude higher than the accuracy that the SSE can provide even within its validity range, the GSE-based approach offers a powerful analytical tool for the rapidly progressing mid- and long-wavelength-infrared optics of the atmosphere.},

In most of those phenomena, charge or spin orders in an original phase are melted by photocarrier generations, while an ordered state is usually difficult to be created from a non-ordered state by a photoexcitation. Here, we demonstrate that a strong terahertz electric-field pulse changes a Mott insulator of an organic molecular compound in               {$\kappa$}               -(ET)               2               Cu[N(CN)               2               ]Cl (ET\,=\,bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene), to a macroscopically polarized charge-order state; herein, electronic ferroelectricity is induced by the collective intermolecular charge transfers in each dimer. In contrast, in an isostructural compound,               {$\kappa$}               -(ET)               2               Cu               2               (CN)               3               , which shows the spin-liquid state at low temperatures, a similar polar charge order is not stabilized by the same terahertz pulse. From the comparative studies of terahertz-field-induced second-harmonic-generation and reflectivity changes in the two compounds, we suggest the possibility that a coupling of charge and spin degrees of freedom would play important roles in the stabilization of polar charge order.},

  abstract = {Heat capacity measurements of quasi-twodimensional Mott insulating compounds consisting of BEDT-TTF (bisethylendithiotetrathiafulubalene) donor molecules and counter anions were performed by the thermal relaxation calorimetry technique for single crystal samples. No distinct thermal anomalies at the predicted antiferromagnetic transition temperatures in j-(BEDTTTF)2Cu[N(CN)2]Cl (TN = 27 K) and b0-(BEDT-TTF)2 ICl2 (TN = 22 K) were observed. These results demonstrate that the Mott insulating state of the organic salts which are dominated by the strong two-dimensional intra-layer antiferromagnetic interactions between neighboring S = 1/2 spins shows somewhat different features from the simple quasi-two-dimensional Heisenberg model with S = 1/2. The strong quantum fluctuations produced by the electron correlations suppress the long-range character of the spin correlations, which seems to be an important aspect of this kind of Mott insulating materials.},

Spectral measurements were made in the frequency range 0.25\textendash 1 THz. The structural models of main triglycerides of fatty acids are constructed using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method and the Gaussian03, Revision B.03 program. The optical density (OD) of adipose tissue samples decreases as temperature increases, which can be associated mostly with the dehydration of the sample. Some inclusion of THz wave scattering suppression into the OD decrease can also be expected due to refractive index matching provided by free fatty acids released from adipocytes at thermally induced cell lipolysis. It was shown that the difference between the THz absorption spectra of water and fat makes it possible to estimate the water content in adipose tissue. The proposed model was verified on the basis of molecular modeling and a comparison with experimental data for terahertz spectra of adipose tissue during its heating. Knowing the exact percentage of free and bound water in adipose tissue can help diagnose and monitor diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and cancer.},

Electronic nematicity, in which the discrete rotational symmetry in the electron fluid is broken while the translational one remains unaffected, is a prominent example of such a phase. It has proven ubiquitous in correlated electron systems, and is of prime importance to understand Fe-based superconductors.

This lends support to a type of electronic nematicity, dynamical in nature, which exhibits a particularly strong coupling to the underlying crystal lattice. Fluctuations between degenerate nematic configurations cause splitting of phonon lines, without lifting degeneracies nor breaking symmetries, akin to spin liquids in magnetic systems.},

All crystals exhibit a similar semiconducting behavior of {$\rho$}(T ) from room temperature down to 100 K. Below approximately 50 K, a metal-to-insulator transition is found for compounds with x {$<$} 70\%. Out of this Mott insulating state, magnetic order develops below TN {$\approx$} 25 K. The Br-rich samples cross a bad-metal regime before they become coherent metals and eventually superconducting at Tc {$\approx$} 12 K. For these systems the resistivity at Tc {$\leq$} T {$\leq$} T0 reveals a {$\rho$}(T ) {$\propto$} T 2 dependence associated with a strongly correlated Fermi-liquid, limited by some characteristic temperature T0.

However, the topological surface state transitions (SSTs) in Dirac cones are veiled by the free carrier absorption (FCA) with same spectral line shape that is always seen in static MIR spectra. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the SST from the FCA, especially in TIs.

The recently discovered layered kagome metal               A               V               3               Sb               5               (               A               \,=\,K, Rb, and Cs) provides us a new playground to study the interplay of superconductivity and CDW state by involving nontrivial topology of band structures. Here, we conduct high-pressure electrical transport and magnetic susceptibility measurements to study CsV               3               Sb               5               with the highest               T               c               of 2.7\,K in               A               V               3               Sb               5               family. While the CDW transition is monotonically suppressed by pressure, superconductivity is enhanced with increasing pressure up to P1\,{$\approx$}\,0.7\,GPa, then an unexpected suppression on superconductivity happens until pressure around 1.1\,GPa, after that,               T               c               is enhanced with increasing pressure again. The CDW is completely suppressed at a critical pressure P2\,{$\approx$}\,2\,GPa together with a maximum               T               c               of about 8\,K.

The unusual suppression of               T               c               at P1 is concomitant with the rapidly damping of quantum oscillations, sudden enhancement of the residual resistivity and rapid decrease of magnetoresistance. Our discoveries indicate an unusual competition between superconductivity and CDW state in pressurized kagome lattice.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Nonequilibrium phase transitions play a pivotal role in broad physical contexts, from condensed matter to cosmology. Tracking the formation of nonequilibrium phases in condensed matter requires a resolution of the long-range cooperativity on ultra-short timescales. Here, we study the spontaneous transformation of a charge-density wave in CeTe               3               from a stripe order into a bi-directional state inaccessible thermodynamically but is induced by intense laser pulses. With {$\approx$}100\,fs resolution coherent electron diffraction, we capture the entire course of this transformation and show self-organization that defines a nonthermal critical point, unveiling the nonequilibrium energy landscape. We discuss the generation of instabilities by a swift interaction quench that changes the system symmetry preference, and the phase ordering dynamics orchestrated over a nonadiabatic timescale to allow new order parameter fluctuations to gain long-range correlations. Remarkably, the subsequent thermalization locks the remnants of the transient order into longer-lived topological defects for more than 2\,ns.},

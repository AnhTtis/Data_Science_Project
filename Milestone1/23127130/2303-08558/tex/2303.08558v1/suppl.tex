\section{Phase modes: Reflective THz time-domain spectroscopy}\label{sec:thz}

\subsection{Fitted conductivity spectra}

As described in detail in Sec.~IV and Appendix B of the main paper, we fitted the complex reflectivity spectra $r(\nu) = \sqrt{R(\nu)}\cdot e^{i\phi(\nu)}$ using a set of Lorentzian bands for the conductivity $\sigma(\nu)$
(which, due to the sensitivity to the precise reflectivity baseline, could not be inverted directly from $r(\nu)$ via the Fresnel reflection formula).
For completeness, we show these fitted conductivity spectra in Fig.~\ref{fig:fitsig}, where one can more readily visualize the relative band strengths and broadening with increasing $T$.

} \label{fig:fitsig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fitting of lowest phase modes}

As discussed in the main paper, the measured strong reflectivity signature at $\nu\simx 1.75\THz$ indicates the presence of a phase mode  (PM) at lower frequency $\nu_{01}$, although we cannot identify its position from our reflectivity spectra.
This is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:fixnu1spec}, where we show fitted spectra for a set of fixed values for $\nu_{01}$, with the corresponding misfit (calculated here for the subrange 0.8-2~THz) in Fig.~\ref{fig:fixnu1misfit}.
One can see the misfit is essentially flat for $\nu_{01}\lesssim 1.2\THz$, with reasonable fits to the spectra (except in the case where such a mode is omitted).
For this reason, in the main paper, we assume a PM at $\nu_{01}=0.1\THz$, corresponding to the ``pinned phason frequency'' found in previous experimental studies \cite{mihaly1989,degiorgi91}.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/fixed_nu1_spectra1b.pdf}
\caption{Reflection spectral intensities ($R(\nu$)) and phases ($\varphi(\nu)$) obtained from THz-TDS measurements at $T=20\Kel$ (blue points), and fitted spectra for selected values of a fixed lowest-mode frequencies $\nu_{01}$ (red curves, as per the labels in the left column). Magenta vertical lines denote position of fitted modes $\nuzn$.
The first plot with $\nu_{01} = 0.1\THz$ is equivalent to the ``$T=20\Kel$''-plot in Fig. 3 from the main paper. A fit with no mode used below $1.75\THz$ is also shown (``$\nu_{01}$ omitted''), which cannot reproduce the strong reflectivity dip at that frequency.

Here the case of ``omitted $\nu_{01}$'' corresponds to a lowest-mode frequency of $2.2\THz$ (corresponding to $\nu_{02}$ in the other fits).

\subsection{Extended-bandwidth TDS measurements with ABCD detection at $T=20\Kel$}

The majority of THz-TDS experiments here used EOS detection, providing a detection  bandwidth limited to $\simx 7\THz$ (see Fig.s~2 and 3 in main paper), due to the onset of phonon absorption in the GaP crystal.
To extend the bandwidth and detect higher-lying modes, we also employed the ABCD detection method \cite{karpowicz08}, which does not suffer from such phonon absorption, and allows here detection up to $\simx 10\THz$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:abcdtds}). 
However, we found that the signal-to-noise ratio and sample alignment sensitivity were superior for EOS detection, and employed ABCD only for $T=20\Kel$ to resolve PMs in the range 7-$9\THz$.

\section{Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model}

\subsection{Theoretical description}\label{sec:tdgl_theory}

The theoretical basis of the TDGL model is given in \cite{schaefer10,schaefer14,thomson17} (and their respective Supplementaries), so we summarize the aspects here only briefly to clarify the particular details/notation for the fitted model results in the present paper.

Writing the complex electronic order parameter (EOP) as 
$\tilde\Delta = \Delta e^{i\varphi} = \Delta_1 + i\Delta_2$ 
and complex bare-phonon coordinates
$\tilde\xi_n = \xi_n e^{i\chi_n} = \xi_{n1} + i\xi_{n2}$ ($n=1\dots N$) (where all coordinates refer to the complex wave amplitudes of the $q=2\kF$ components), we consider the potential function:
\beq
U(\tilde\Delta,\tilde\xi_1,\dots,\tilde\xi_N)=
U_{\Delta} + U_{\xi n} + \usr{U}{c} + \usr{U}{p},
\label{eq:tdglU}
\eeq
where 
$U_{\Delta}=-\tfrac{1}{2}\alpha(\Tcz-T)\Delta^2 + \tfrac{1}{4}\beta \Delta^4$ 
is the Mexican hat potential, 
$U_{\xi n}=\tfrac{1}{2}\Wzn^2 \xi_n^2$ 
represents the elastic energy stored in the bare phonon mode $n$ with frequency $\Wzn$, 
$\usr{U}{c}=-m_n(\Delta_1\xi_{n1}+\Delta_2\xi_{n2}) = -m_n\Delta\cdot\xi_{n}\cos(\varphi-\chi_n)$ is the linear coupling term (summations over $n$ are left implicit), and
$\Upin=-\Wpin^2\Delta^2\cos{\varphi}$ 
the impurity pinning energy \cite{tucker1989,wonneberger1999} (discussed below).

This has the equilibrium solution (neglecting a small correction for the pinning potential)
$$\Delta_0^2=\frac{\alpha(\Tc-T)}{\beta}, \qquad 
\xi_{0n}=\frac{m_n}{\Wzn^2}\Delta_0, \qquad 
\Tc=\Tcz+\frac{m_n^2}{\alpha\Wzn^2},
$$
where $\Tc$ is the renormalized critical temperature, and 
$\varphi_0=\chi_{n0}=0$  due to the impurity pinning minimum.

Calculating the Hessian matrix of the potential about $\tilde\Delta_0=\Delta_0$ yields the linearized equations of motion \cite{schaefer10,schaefer14,thomson17}:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\partial_t{\hat\Delta_1}&=
-\kappa_1 \left[ 2\alpha(\Tc-T) + \frac{m_n^2}{\Wzn^2} +2\Wpin^2 \right]\hat\Delta_1  +\kappa_1 m_n\hat\xi_{n1} \label{eq:motionDA}
%\partial_t^2{\hat\Delta_1}&=-\left[ 2\alpha(\Tc-T) + \frac{m_n^2}{\Wzn^2} \right]\hat\Delta_1 +m_n\hat\xi_{n1} - \gamma_1\partial_t{\hat\Delta_1} \label{eq:motionDA}
 \\
 %
\partial_t^2{\hat\Delta_2}&=-\left(\frac{m_n^2}{\Wzn^2}+\Wpin^2\right)\hat\Delta_2
 +m_n\hat\xi_{n2} - \gamma_2\partial_t{\hat\Delta_2} \label{eq:motionDP}
 \\  %
\partial_t^2{\hat\xi_{n1}}&=m_n\hat\Delta_{1} - \Wzn^2 \hat\xi_{n1} 
- \gamma_{\xi n}\partial_t \hat{\xi}_{n2}\\
%
\partial_t^2{\hat\xi_{n2}}&=m_n\hat\Delta_{2} - \Wzn^2 \hat\xi_{n2}
- \gamma_{\xi n}\partial_t \hat{\xi}_{n2}
\end{align} \label{eq:motion}%
\end{subequations}
where $\hat\Delta_1\approx \Delta-\Delta_0$ and $\hat\Delta_2\approx\Delta_0 \varphi$ represent the amplitude and phase deviations from equilibrium (likewise for $\hat \xi_{n1}$,$\hat \xi_{n2}$), and we have added phenomenological damping constants $\gamma_{1,2}$ for the EOP $\hat\Delta_{1,2}$ (and allow for $\gamma_1 \neq \gamma_2$), and $\gamma_{\xi n}$ for the $n$th bare phonon.
Note that in Eq.~\eqref{eq:motionDA} we have taken the overdamped limit 
$\partial_t^2\hat\Delta_1 \ll \gamma \partial_t\hat\Delta_1$ 
for the EOP-amplitude (as per \cite{schaefer10,schaefer14,thomson17})
while we retain the general damping case for the EOP-phase in Eq.~\eqref{eq:motionDP}, as appropriate in the present paper where we consider $\gamma_2\ll \gamma_1$.
Also, while tests were performed with different models for the bare-phonon damping $\gamma_{\xi n}> 0$, we found that these do not significantly assist fitting of the experimental modes and set $\gamma_{\xi n}\equiv 0$ for the analysis shown in the main paper.

The collective modes are found by substituting the ansatz $\propto e^{\lambda t}$ for all coordinates in Eq.s~\eqref{eq:motion}, yielding the eigenvalues $\lambda_n=-\Gamma_n/2+i\wzn$.  
%
For the amplitude channel, with eigenvector components in $(\hat\Delta_1,\hat\xi_{n1})$, one has $N$ modes with $\wzn>0$ and one overdamped mode ($\wzn=0$).
For the phase channel, with eigenvector components in $(\hat\Delta_2,\hat\xi_{n2})$, one has (i) a ``phason'' with $\omega_{01}$ close to zero 
(at finite frequency due to pinning when the damping $\gamma_2$ is sufficiently weak, as is the case here), (ii) $N-1$ modes close to their respective bare-phonon frequencies ($\Wzn$, $n \geq 2$) and (iii) one high-frequency mode (well above all $\Wzn$) with a much higher damping.
(All modes with $\wzn\neq 0$ also possessing a complex-conjugate eigenvalue with $\wzn<0$).
These results are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:tdgl_phase} for the TDGL parameters employed in the main paper to model the experimental data. %
%

An inspection of the eigenvector for the high-frequency PM above 20~THz shows that it involves almost purely the EOP phase ($\hat\Delta_2$), and only manifests here by not taking the overdamped limit for the phase channel in Eq.~\eqref{eq:motion}.
Given its energy, one might be tempted to connect it with the single-particle gap (also found close to this frequency \cite{degiorgi94}), although we stress here that the TDGL does not explicitly contain this gap energy, and so one cannot make this association. 
Indeed, the condensation energy in Eq.~\eqref{eq:tdglU} can be shown to be 
$U_C=\tfrac{1}{4}\alpha(T-T_c)\Delta_0^2$, where the arbitrary nominal scaling of $\Delta$ reflects this lack of energy-gap calibration. 
Given that this predicted mode has a frequency close to the single-particle gap, it may well be more strongly damped than in the TDGL prediction.  Also, its current position is based on a TDGL model accounting for bare modes only up to $\simx 9\THz$, and so such a mode may rather appear at even higher frequencies if additional bare modes were included.
Interestingly, a close inspection of this spectral region in previous 
mid-infrared reflectivity studies \cite{degiorgi91,degiorgi94,beyer2012} indicates that such a feature could be possibly present, but obscured due to overlap with other spectral features.

\caption{PM parameters vs. $T$ from TDGL model of experimental modes: (a) Mode frequencies and (b) FWHM bandwidths.} \label{fig:tdgl_phase}
\end{figure}

The ansatz for our pinning potential $\Upin$ here warrants further discussion.  An intuitive formulation would be 
$\Upinx=-\usr{V}{i}\cdot\Delta\cdot\cos{\varphi}=\usr{V}{i}\cdot\Delta_1$ \cite{tucker1989}, with the factor $\Delta$ reflecting the CDW amplitude (and hence the magnitude of net charge interacting with the impurity) and $\cos{\varphi}$ describing how this interaction varies between attractive/repulsive as the CDW translates over the impurity.  Clearly, for the form $\Upinx$ (with $\usr{V}{i}$ constant), the Hessian terms $\partial^2 \Upinx/\partial \Delta_{1,2}^2$ vanish, and hence also the force terms about the equilibrium $\Delta_0$ in Eq.s~\eqref{eq:motion} (the pinning only causing a small positive shift in $\Delta_0$).
A more careful treatment of the relation between the phase $\varphi$ and Cartesian coordinate $\hat \Delta_2$ about $(\Delta_1,\Delta_2)=(\Delta_0,0)$ yields 
$\Upinx\approx -\usr{V}{i}\cdot\Delta_0(1-\tfrac{1}{2}\varphi^2)
\approx -\usr{V}{i}(\Delta_0-\tfrac{1}{2}\Delta_2^2/\Delta_0)$.
This indeed yields a finite value of
$\partial^2 \Upinx/\partial \Delta_2^2=-\usr{V}{i}/\Delta_0$.  However, this term diverges as $T\rarr T_c$ ($\Delta_0\rarr 0$), which for \kmo seems untenable as the experimental phason frequency is found to remain close to 
$\nuzP=0.1\THz$ for all $T$ \cite{degiorgi91} (although divergent pinning fields for $T\rarr T_c$ were indeed observed for other quasi-1D CDW system, e.g. \chem{Nb/,Se/3} \cite{mccarten1992}).

We instead propose a pinning potential of the form 
$\Upin=-\Wpin^2\Delta^2\cos{\varphi}=-\Wpin^2\Delta\cdot\Delta_1$.
This yields 
\beq
\frac{\partial^2\Upin}{\partial \Delta_1^2}=-\Wpin^2
\frac{\Delta_1(2\Delta_1^2+3\Delta_2^2)}{\Delta^2}
\xrightarrow[\Delta_0]{} - 2\Wpin^2, \qquad 
\frac{\partial^2\Upin}{\partial \Delta_2^2}=-\Wpin^2\frac{\Delta_1^3}{2\Delta_1^2+3\Delta_2^2}
\xrightarrow[\Delta_0]{} - \Wpin^2,
\eeq
and hence a $T$-independent pinning force along both $\Delta_{1,2}$.  Note that for our TDGL parameters, the pinning term only has a significant effect on the lowest PM (phason).

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we design a multi-view image translation framework for VS and cochlea segmentation. Specifically, we adopt CycleGAN and QS-Attn in parallel to translate the given ceT1 images to pseudo-hrT2 images reflecting various perspectives. Based on the pseudo-hrT2 images, the segmentation model can learn both structures and textures of VS and cochleas. Our proposed method obtained great achievement in the CrossMoDA challenge2022.

    "abstract": "We perform polarized optical reflection measurements on a single nodal-ring semimetal $\\rm{SrAs_3}$. For the radial and axial directions of the ring, the optical conductivity $σ_1(ω)$ exhibits a flat absorption $σ^{\\mathrm{flat}}$ over a certain frequency range. In addition, a prominent optical peak appears at 2$Δ_{\\mathrm{SOC}}$ = 30 meV. For comparison, we theoretically calculate $σ_1(ω)$ using an effective model Hamiltonian and first-principles calculations, which successfully reproduces the data for both directions. The $σ^{\\mathrm{flat}}$ establishes that the universal power-law of optical conductivity holds robustly in the nodal ring. Furthermore, key quantities of the nodal ring such as the band overlap energy, average ring radius, ring ellipticity, and the SOC-gap are determined from this comparative study. As temperature increases, $σ_1(ω)$ shows a substantial change, suggesting that a $T$-driven evolution occurs in the nodal ring.",

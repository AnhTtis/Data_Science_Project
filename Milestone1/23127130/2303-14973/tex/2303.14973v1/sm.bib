We investigated anisotropic electrodynamics of NbAs2 where the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) triggers energy gaps along the nodal lines. These gaps manifest as sharp steps in the optical conductivity spectra σ1(ω). This behavior is followed by the linear power-law scaling of σ1(ω) at higher frequencies, consistent with our theoretical analysis for dispersive Dirac nodal lines. Magneto-optics data affirm the dominant role of nodal lines in the electrodynamics of NbAs2.},

  abstract = {Anomalous transport responses, dictated by the nontrivial band topology, are the key for application of topological materials to advanced electronics and spintronics. One promising platform is topological nodal-line semimetals due to their rich topology and exotic physical properties. However, their transport signatures have often been masked by the complexity in band crossings or the coexisting topologically trivial states. Here we show that, in slightly hole-doped SrAs3, the single-loop nodal-line states are well-isolated from the trivial states and entirely determine the transport responses. The characteristic torus-shaped Fermi surface and the associated encircling Berry flux of nodal-line fermions are clearly manifested by quantum oscillations of the magnetotransport properties and the quantum interference effect resulting in the two-dimensional behaviors of weak antilocalization. These unique quantum transport signatures make the isolated nodal-line fermions in SrAs3 desirable for novel devices based on their topological charge and spin transport.},

We obtain the nontrivial π Berry phase by analysing the Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations. We also observe a robust negative longitudinal magnetoresistance induced by the chiral anomaly. Accompanying first-principles calculations identifies that a single hole pocket enclosing the loop nodes is responsible for these observations.},

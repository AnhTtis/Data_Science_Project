    "abstract": "Federated learning has gained popularity as a solution to data availability and privacy challenges in machine learning. However, the aggregation process of local model updates to obtain a global model in federated learning is susceptible to malicious attacks, such as backdoor poisoning, label-flipping, and membership inference. Malicious users aim to sabotage the collaborative learning process by training the local model with malicious data. In this paper, we propose a novel robust aggregation approach based on recursive Euclidean distance calculation. Our approach measures the distance of the local models from the previous global model and assigns weights accordingly. Local models far away from the global model are assigned smaller weights to minimize the data poisoning effect during aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by at least $5\\%$ in accuracy while reducing time complexity by less than $55\\%$. Our contribution is significant as it addresses the critical issue of malicious attacks in federated learning while improving the accuracy of the global model.",

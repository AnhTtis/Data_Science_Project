    "abstract": "Recently, it was argued that a ferromagnetic (FM) insulating phase can be induced by a novel {\\it interorbital} hopping mechanism. Here, we study the stability range of this novel FM phase under modifications in the crystal fields and electronic correlation strength, constructing a theoretical phase diagram. A plethora of states is unveiled, including the FM Mott insulator (MI), a FM orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP), several anferromagnetic (AFM) MI phases, an AFM metallic state, and a FM metal as well. Our most interesting result is that the FM regime, either in MI or OSMP forms, is shown to be stable in {\\it large} portions of the phase diagram, at both intermediate and strong electronic correlations, respectively. Our results demonstrate via a detailed example that the recently proposed novel mechanism to stabilize FM insulators is not fragile but instead robust, and may enlarge substantially the relatively small family of known FM insulators.",

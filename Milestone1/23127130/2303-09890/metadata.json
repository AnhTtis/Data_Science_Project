    "abstract": "We introduce the concept of k-strictly convexity to describe the accurate convexity of convex domains some directions of which boundary may be flat. Basing this accurate convexity, we construct sub-solutions the Dirichlet problem for some degenerate-singular Monge-Ampère type equations and prove the sharp boundary estimates for convex viscosity solutions of the problem. As a result, we obtain the optimal global Hölder regularity of the convex viscosity solutions.",

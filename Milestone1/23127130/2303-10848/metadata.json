    "abstract": "Text segmentation is a challenging vision task with many downstream applications. Current text segmentation methods require pixel-level annotations, which are expensive in the cost of human labor and limited in application scenarios. In this paper, we take the first attempt to perform weakly-supervised text instance segmentation by bridging text recognition and text segmentation. The insight is that text recognition methods provide precise attention position of each text instance, and the attention location can feed to both a text adaptive refinement head (TAR) and a text segmentation head. Specifically, the proposed TAR generates pseudo labels by performing two-stage iterative refinement operations on the attention location to fit the accurate boundaries of the corresponding text instance. Meanwhile, the text segmentation head takes the rough attention location to predict segmentation masks which are supervised by the aforementioned pseudo labels. In addition, we design a mask-augmented contrastive learning by treating our segmentation result as an augmented version of the input text image, thus improving the visual representation and further enhancing the performance of both recognition and segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms weakly-supervised instance segmentation methods on ICDAR13-FST (18.95$\\%$ improvement) and TextSeg (17.80$\\%$ improvement) benchmarks.",

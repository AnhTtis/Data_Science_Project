    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a finitely generated group. We prove that the $n$-fold tensor product $G^{\\otimes n}$ is finite (resp. polycyclic) if and only $G$ is finite (resp. polycyclic). Further, assuming that $G$ is finitely presented, we show that $G^{\\otimes n}$ is finitely presented if and only if $γ_n(G)$ is finitely presented. We also examine some finiteness conditions for the non-abelian tensor product of groups.",

The programme, described in detail in this paper, aims to study the ultimate products of structure formation in time and mass. It is composed of a census of the most recent objects to have formed (Tier-1: 0.05 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.2; 2 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}500{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 9 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), together with a sample of the highest mass objects in the Universe (Tier-2: z \&lt; 0.6; M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}500{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 7.25 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). The programme will yield an accurate vision of the statistical properties of the underlying population, measure how the gas properties are shaped by collapse into the dark matter halo, uncover the provenance of non-gravitational heating, and resolve the major uncertainties in mass determination that limit the use of clusters for cosmological parameter estimation. We will acquire X-ray exposures of uniform depth, designed to obtain individual mass measurements accurate to 15 − 20\% under the hydrostatic assumption. We present the project motivations, describe the programme definition, and detail the ongoing multi-wavelength observational (lensing, SZ, radio) and theoretical effort that is being deployed in support of the project.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades, Bayesian inference has become commonplace in astronomy. At the same time, the choice of algorithms, terminology, notation, and interpretation of Bayesian inference varies from one sub-field of astronomy to the next, which can lead to confusion to both those learning and those familiar with Bayesian statistics. Moreover, the choice varies between the astronomy and statistics literature, too. In this paper, our goal is two-fold: (1) provide a reference that consolidates and clarifies terminology and notation across disciplines, and (2) outline practical guidance for Bayesian inference in astronomy. Highlighting both the astronomy and statistics literature, we cover topics such as notation, specification of the likelihood and prior distributions, inference using the posterior distribution, and posterior predictive checking. It is not our intention to introduce the entire field of Bayesian data analysis -- rather, we present a series of useful practices for astronomers who already have an understanding of the Bayesian "nuts and bolts" and wish to increase their expertise and extend their knowledge. Moreover, as the field of astrostatistics and astroinformatics continues to grow, we hope this paper will serve as both a helpful reference and as a jumping off point for deeper dives into the statistics and astrostatistics literature.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01388},
	abstract = {Which galaxies in the general population turn into active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a keystone of galaxy formation and evolution. Thanks to SRG/eROSITA's contiguous 140 square degrees pilot survey field, we constructed a large, complete, and unbiased soft X-ray flux-limited AGN sample at low redshift \$0.05{\textless}z{\textless}0.55\$. Two summary statistics, the clustering using spectra from SDSS-V and galaxy-galaxy lensing with imaging from HSC, are measured and interpreted with halo occupation distribution and abundance matching models. Both models successfully account for the observations. We obtain an exceptional complete view of the AGN halo occupation distribution. The population of AGN is broadly distributed among halos with a mean mass of \$3.9 \_\{- 2.4 \}{\textasciicircum}\{+ 2.0 \}{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. This corresponds to a large-scale halo bias of \$b(z=0.34)= 0.99 {\textasciicircum}\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.10\}\$. The central occupation has a large transition parameter \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}log\_\{10\}(M)\}=1.28{\textbackslash}pm0.2\$. The satellite occupation distribution is characterized by a shallow slope \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm sat\}\}=0.73{\textbackslash}pm0.38\$. We find that AGNs in satellites are rare, with \$f\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm sat\}\}{\textless}20{\textbackslash}\%\$. Most soft X-ray-selected AGNs are hosted by central galaxies in their dark matter halo. A weak correlation between soft X-ray luminosity and large-scale halo bias is confirmed (3.3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$). We discuss the implications of environmental-dependent AGN triggering. This study paves the way towards fully charting, in the coming decade, the co-evolution of X-ray AGN, their host galaxies, and dark matter haloes by combining eROSITA with SDSS-V, 4MOST, DESI, LSST, and Euclid.},

	abstract = {We present the deepest Chandra observation to date of the galaxy M84 in the Virgo Cluster, with over 840 kiloseconds of data provided by legacy observations and a recent 730 kilosecond campaign. The increased signal-to-noise allows us to study the origins of the accretion flow feeding the supermassive black hole in the center of M84 from the kiloparsec scales of the X-ray halo to the Bondi radius, \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm B\}\$. Temperature, metallicity, and deprojected density profiles are obtained in four sectors about M84's AGN, extending into the Bondi radius. Rather than being dictated by the potential of the black hole, the accretion flow is strongly influenced by the AGN's bipolar radio jets. Along the jet axis, the density profile is consistent with \$n\_e {\textbackslash}propto r{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$; however, the profiles flatten perpendicular to the jet. Radio jets produce a significant asymmetry in the flow, violating a key assumption of Bondi accretion. Temperature in the inner kiloparsec is approximately constant, with only a slight increase from 0.6 to 0.7 keV approaching \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm B\}\$, and there is no evidence for a temperature rise imposed by the black hole. The Bondi accretion rate \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm B\}\$ exceeds the rate inferred from AGN luminosity and jet power by over four orders of magnitude. In sectors perpendicular to the jet, \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm B\}\$ measurements agree; however, the accretion rate is \${\textgreater} 4 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ lower in the North sector along the jet, likely due to cavities in the X-ray gas. Our measurements provide unique insight into the fueling of AGN responsible for radio mode feedback in galaxy clusters.},

Tables of the inverse matrices required for certain generalized formulae of the Newton-Cotes type are given, together with tables of the coefficients required in the correction terms. If f(x) is a polynomial of degree n, and n + 1 ordinates are used, then, whatever the form of φ (x), the formulae are exact, that is, they introduce no analytical error. When it is convenient to do so, ordinates outside the range of integration may be used, no change in the method of deriving the formulae being necessary. If the integrand is singular within or near the range of integration, conventional methods of numerical integration break down, but in the formulae derived here, the presence of singularities in φ (x) does not affect the derivation if certain conditions are satisfied. The methods are not affected by discontinuities in φ (x).

Using a combination of centre offset, virial ratio, mean radial velocity, sparsity and ellipticity of the dark matter halo, we study how the thresholds on these parameters, as well as their relative weights, should evolve with redshift to provide the best classification possible. This allows us to split a sample of haloes in a totally relaxed, a marginally relaxed and an unrelaxed subsamples. The resulting classification strongly correlates with the merging activity obtained from the analysis of complete merger trees extracted from whole simulation data. The results on how the different indicators depend on redshift and halo mass, and their optimal combination to better match the true assembly history of haloes, could constitute relevant hints to find a suitable set of indicators applicable to observational data.},

	abstract = {We investigate for the first time the effect of the dark matter (DM) halos collisions, namely collisions of galaxies and galaxy clusters, through gravitational bremsstrahlung, on the stochastic gravitational wave background. We first calculate the gravitational wave signal of a single collision event, assuming point masses and linear perturbation theory. Then we proceed to the calculation of the energy spectrum of the collective effect of all dark matter collisions in the Universe. Concerning the DM halo collision rate we show that it is given by the product of the number density of DM halos, which is calculated by the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) theory, with the collision rate of a single DM halo, which is given by simulation results, with a function of the linear growth rate of matter density through cosmological evolution. Hence, integrating over all mass and distance ranges, we finally extract the spectrum of the stochastic gravitational wave background created by DM halos collisions. As we show, the resulting contribution to the stochastic gravitational wave background is of the order of \$h\_\{c\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{-30\}\$ in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band of \$f {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{-9\} Hz\$, much smaller than other GW sources, such as super-massive black-hole mergers. However, in very low frequency band, it is larger. With current observational sensitivity it cannot be detected, nevertheless it may be accessible by PTA in the future, where techniques of distinguishing signal overlap should be used in order to isolate it and use it for cosmological studies.},

	abstract = {The characterization of the dynamical state of clusters is key to study their evolution, their selection, and use them as a cosmological probe. The offsets between different definitions of the center have been used to estimate the cluster disturbance. Our goal is to study the distribution of the offset between the X-ray and optical centers in clusters of galaxies. We study the offset for eROSITA clusters. We aim to connect observations to hydrodynamical simulations and N-body models. We assess the astrophysical effects affecting the displacements. We measure the offset for clusters observed in eFEDS and eRASS1. We focus on a subsample of 87 massive eFEDS clusters at low redshift. We link the observations to the offset parameter Xoff measured on dark matter halos in N-body simulations, using the hydrodynamical simulations as a bridge. eFEDS clusters show a smaller offset compared to eRASS1, because the latter contains a larger fraction of massive and disturbed structures. We measure an average offset of 76.3+30.1-27.1 kpc on the subsample of 87 eFEDS clusters. This is in agreement with the predictions from TNG and Magneticum, and the distribution of Xoff from DMO simulations. The tails of the distributions are different. Using the offset to classify relaxed and disturbed clusters, we measure a relaxed fraction of 31\% in the eFEDS subsample. Finally, we find a correlation between the offset in hydrodynamical simulations and Xoff measured on their parent DMO run and calibrate a relation between them. There is good agreement between eROSITA data and simulations. Baryons cause a decrement (increment) in the low (high) offset regime compared to the Xoff distribution. The offset-Xoff relation provides an accurate prediction of the true Xoff distribution in Magneticum and TNG. It allows introducing the offsets in cosmology, marginalizing on dynamical selection effects.},

	abstract = {The number density of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift is a sensitive function of the cosmological parameters. To use clusters for cosmological parameter studies, it is necessary to determine their masses as accurately as possible, which is typically done via mass-observable scaling relations. X-ray observables can be biased by multiphase gas and projection effects, especially in the case where cluster temperatures and luminosities are estimated from single-model fits to all of the emission with a given radius. Using simulated galaxy clusters from a realistic cosmological simulation, we seek to determine the importance of these biases in the context of Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma/eROSITA observations of clusters. We extract clusters from the Magneticum suite, and simulate eROSITA observations of these clusters using PHOX and SIXTE. We compare the fitted observables from these observations to those derived from the simulations. We fitted an intrinsically scattered \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}-T\$ scaling relation to these measurements following a Bayesian approach with which we fully took into account the selection effects and the mass function. The largest biases on the cluster observables come from the inadequacy of single-temperature model fits to represent emission from multiphase gas, as well as a bias arising from cluster emission within the projected \$r\_\{500c\}\$ along the line of sight but outside of the spherical \$r\_\{500c\}\$. We find that the biases on temperature and luminosity due to the projection of emission from other clusters within \$r\_\{500c\}\$ is small. We find that our simulated clusters follow a \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}-T\$ scaling relation that has a broadly consistent but slightly shallower slope compared to the literature, and that the intrinsic scatter of \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}\$ at given T is lower compared to the recent observational results where the selection effects are fully considered.},

	abstract = {X-ray surface brightness fluctuations in the core of the Perseus Cluster are analysed, using deep observations with the Chandra observatory. The amplitude of gas density fluctuations on different scales is measured in a set of radial annuli. It varies from 7 to 12 per cent on scales of ∼10–30 kpc within radii of 30–220 kpc from the cluster centre. Using a statistical linear relation between the observed amplitude of density fluctuations and predicted velocity, the characteristic velocity of gas motions on each scale is calculated. The typical amplitudes of the velocity outside the central 30 kpc region are 90–140 km s−1 on ∼20–30 kpc scales and 70–100 km s−1 on smaller scales ∼7–10 kpc. The velocity power spectrum (PS) is consistent with cascade of turbulence and its slope is in a broad agreement with the slope for canonical Kolmogorov turbulence. The gas clumping factor estimated from the PS of the density fluctuations is lower than 7–8 per cent for radii ∼30–220 kpc from the centre, leading to a density bias of less than 3–4 per cent in the cluster core. Uncertainties of the analysis are examined and discussed. Future measurements of the gas velocities with the Astro-H, Athena and Smart-X observatories will directly measure the gas density–velocity perturbation relation and further reduce systematic uncertainties in this analysis.},

One of the best targets for turbulence studies is the Coma cluster, due to its proximity, absence of a cool core, and lack of a central active galactic nucleus. To determine what constraints Astro-H will be able to place on the Coma velocity field, we construct simulated maps of the projected gas velocity and compute the second-order structure function, an analog of the velocity power spectrum. We vary the injection scale, dissipation scale, slope, and normalization of the turbulent power spectrum, and apply measurement errors and finite sampling to the velocity field. We find that even with sparse coverage of the cluster, Astro-H will be able to measure the Mach number and the injection scale of the turbulent power spectrum—the quantities determining the energy flux down the turbulent cascade and the diffusion rate for everything that is advected by the gas (metals, cosmic rays, etc.). Astro-H will not be sensitive to the dissipation scale or the slope of the power spectrum in its inertial range, unless they are outside physically motivated intervals. We give the expected confidence intervals for the injection scale and the normalization of the power spectrum for a number of possible pointing configurations, combining the structure function and velocity dispersion data. Importantly, we also determine that measurement errors on the line shift will bias the velocity structure function upward, and show how to correct this bias.},

	abstract = {Buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma are essential for active galactic nucleus feedback in galaxy clusters, stirring and heating the intracluster medium (ICM). Observations suggest that these rising bubbles maintain their integrity and sharp edges much longer than predicted by hydrodynamic simulations. In this study, we assume that bubbles can be modelled as rigid bodies and demonstrate that intact bubbles and their long-term interactions with the ambient ICM play an important role in shaping gas kinematics, forming thin gaseous structures (e.g. H α filaments), and generating internal waves in cluster cores. We find that well-developed eddies are formed in the wake of a buoyantly rising bubble, and it is these eddies, rather than the Darwin drift, that are responsible for most of the gas mass uplift. The eddies gradually elongate along the bubble’s direction of motion due to the strong density stratification of the atmosphere and eventually detach from the bubble, quickly evolving into a high-speed jet-like stream propagating towards the cluster center in our model. This picture naturally explains the presence of long straight and horseshoe-shaped H α filaments in the Perseus cluster, inward and outward motions of the gas, and the X-ray-weighted gas velocity distributions near the northwestern bubble observed by Hitomi. Our model reproduces the observed H α velocity structure function of filaments, providing a simple interpretation for its steep scaling and normalization: laminar gas flows and large eddies within filaments driven by the intact bubbles, rather than spatially homogeneous small-scale turbulence, are sufficient to produce a structure function consistent with observations.},

In order to enhance the scientific outputs of the mission, the Science Operations Team (SOT) is structured independently from the Instrument Teams (ITs) and the Mission Operations Team. The responsibilities of the SOT are divided into four categories: (1) guest observer program and data distributions, (2) distribution of analysis software and the calibration database, (3) guest observer support activities, and (4) performance verification and optimization activities. Before constructing the operations concept of the XRISM mission, lessons on the science operations learned from past Japanese x-ray missions (ASCA, Suzaku, and Hitomi) are reviewed, and 15 kinds of lessons are identified by categories, such as lessons on the importance of avoiding non-public (“animal”) tools, coding quality of public tools in terms of the engineering viewpoint and calibration accuracy, tight communications with ITs and operations teams, and well-defined task division between scientists and engineers. Among these lessons, (a) the importance of early preparation of the operations from the ground stage, (b) construction of an independent team for science operations separate from the instrument development, and (c) operations with well-defined duties by appointed members are recognized as key lessons for XRISM. Based on this, (i) the task division between the mission and science operations and (ii) the subgroup structure within the XRISM Team are defined in detail as the XRISM operations concept. Based on this operations concept, the detailed plan of the science operations is designed as follows. The science operations tasks are shared among Japan, the USA, and Europe and are performed by three centers: the Science Operations Center (SOC) at JAXA, the Science Data Center (SDC) at NASA, and European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) at the ESA. The SOT is defined as a combination of the SOC and SDC. The SOC is designed to perform tasks close to the spacecraft operations, such as spacecraft planning of science targets, quick-look health checks, and prepipeline data processing. The SDC covers tasks regarding data calibration processing (pipeline processing) and maintenance of analysis tools. The data-archive and user-support activities are planned to be covered both by the SOC and SDC. Finally, the details of the science operations tasks and the tools for science operations are defined and prepared before launch. This information is expected to be helpful for the construction of science operations of future x-ray missions.},

The improvement of data quality and quantity requires an assessment of the systematics associated with this new data analysis, namely biases, statistical and systematic errors, and possible correlations between the different measured quantities.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We have developed an end-to-end X-IFU simulator that mimics a full X-ray spectral fitting analysis on a set of mock event lists, obtained using SIXTE. We have applied it to three hydrodynamical simulations of a Coma-like cluster that include the injection of turbulence. This allowed us to assess the ability of X-IFU to map five physical quantities in the cluster core: emission measure, temperature, metal abundance, velocity, and velocity dispersion. Finally, starting from our measurements maps, we computed the 2D structure function (SF) of emission measure fluctuations, {\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}w{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, and compared them with those derived directly from the simulations.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. All quantities match with the input projected values without bias; the systematic errors were below 5\%, except for velocity dispersion whose error reaches about 15\%. Moreover, all measurements prove to be statistically independent, indicating the robustness of the fitting method. Most importantly, we recover the slope of the SFs in the inertial regime with excellent accuracy, but we observe a systematic excess in the normalization of both SF{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and SF{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}w{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ascribed to the simplistic assumption of uniform and (bi-)Gaussian measurement errors.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}i/{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {Determining the origin of turbulence in galaxy clusters, and quantifying its transport of heat, is an outstanding problem, with implications for our understanding of their thermodynamic history and structure. As the dilute plasma of the intracluster medium (ICM) is magnetized, heat and momentum travel preferentially along magnetic field lines. This anisotropy triggers a class of buoyancy instabilities that destabilize the ICM, and whose turbulent motions can augment or impede heat transport. We focus on the magneto-thermal instability (MTI), which may be active in the periphery of galaxy clusters. We aim to take a fresh look at the problem and construct a general theory that explains the MTI saturation mechanism and provides scalings and estimates for the turbulent kinetic energy, magnetic energy, and heat flux. We simulate MTI turbulence with a Boussinesq code, snoopy, which, in contrast to previous work, allows us to perform an extensive sampling of the parameter space. In two dimensions the saturation mechanism involves an inverse cascade that carries kinetic energy from the short MTI injection scales to larger scales, where it is arrested by the stable entropy stratification; at a characteristic ‘buoyancy scale’, the energy is dumped into large-scale g-modes, which subsequently dissipate. Consequently, the entropy stratification sets an upper limit on the size and strength of turbulent eddies. Meanwhile, the MTI conveys a substantial fraction of heat, despite the tangled geometry of the magnetic field. In a companion paper, these results are extended to three-dimensional flows, and compared to observations of real clusters.},

	abstract = {We conduct two kinds of homogeneous isotropic turbulence simulations relevant for the intracluster medium (ICM): (i) pure turbulence runs without radiative cooling and (ii) turbulent heating + radiative cooling runs with global thermal balance. For pure turbulence runs in the subsonic regime, the rms density and surface brightness (SB) fluctuations vary as the square of the rms Mach number (\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{rms\}\}\$). However, with thermal balance, the density and SB fluctuations (δSB/SB) are much larger. These scalings have implications for translating SB fluctuations into a turbulent velocity, particularly for cool cores. For thermal balance runs with large (cluster core) scale driving, both the hot and cold phases of the gas are supersonic. For small-scale (one order of magnitude smaller than the cluster core) driving, multiphase gas forms on a much longer time-scale but \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{rms\}\}\$ is smaller. Both small- and large-scale driving runs have velocities larger than the Hitomi results from the Perseus cluster. Thus, turbulent heating as the dominant heating source in cool cluster cores is ruled out if multiphase gas is assumed to condense out from the ICM. Next we perform thermal balance runs in which we partition the input energy into thermal and turbulent parts and tune their relative magnitudes. The contribution of turbulent heating has to be \$\{{\textbackslash}lesssim \} 10\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ in order for turbulence velocities to match Hitomi observations. If the dominant source of multiphase gas is not cooling from the ICM (but say uplift from the central galaxy), the importance of turbulent heating cannot be excluded.},

Therefore, hot atmospheres are expected to cool and to form stars. Cold gas and star formation are observed in central cluster galaxies but at levels below those expected from an unimpeded cooling flow. X-ray observations have shown that wholesale cooling is being offset by mechanical heating from radio active galactic nuclei. Feedback is widely considered to be an important and perhaps unavoidable consequence of the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. We show that cooling x-ray atmospheres and the ensuing star formation and nuclear activity are probably coupled to a self-regulated feedback loop. While the energetics are now reasonably well understood, other aspects of feedback are not. We highlight the problems of atmospheric heating and transport processes, accretion, and nuclear activity, and we discuss the potential role of black hole spin. We discuss x-ray imagery showing that the chemical elements produced by central galaxies are being dispersed on large scales by outflows launched from the vicinity of supermassive black holes. Finally, we comment on the growing evidence for mechanical heating of distant cluster atmospheres by radio jets and its potential consequences for the excess entropy in hot halos and a possible decline in the number of distant cooling flows.},

The most disturbed systems, which are good to study how clusters form and grow and to test physical models, may potentially complicate cosmological studies because the cluster mass determination becomes more challenging. Thus, we need to understand the cluster properties of our samples to reduce possible biases. This is complicated by the fact that different experiments may detect different cluster populations. For example, Sunyaev–Zeldovich (SZ) selected cluster samples have been found to include a greater fraction of disturbed systems than X-ray selected samples. In this paper we determine eight morphological parameters for the Planck Early Sunyaev–Zeldovich (ESZ) objects observed with XMM-Newton. We found that two parameters, concentration and centroid shift, are the best to distinguish between relaxed and disturbed systems. For each parameter we provide the values that allow selecting the most relaxed or most disturbed objects from a sample. We found that there is no mass dependence on the cluster dynamical state. By comparing our results with what was obtained with REXCESS clusters, we also confirm that the ESZ clusters indeed tend to be more disturbed, as found by previous studies.},

The SZ data links the maximum observable X-ray scale to the large Mpc scale, extending our knowledge of the power spectrum of ICM fluctuations. Deprojecting the 2D SZ perturbations into 3D pressure fluctuations, we find an amplitude spectrum which peaks at δP/P = 33 ± 12 and 74 ± 19 per cent in the 15 and 40 arcmin radius region, respectively. We perform tests to ensure fluctuations are intrinsic to the cluster and not due to noise contamination. By using high-resolution hydrodynamical models, we improve the ICM turbulence constraints in Coma, finding 3D Mach number Ma3d = 0.8 ± 0.3 (15 arcmin region), increasing to supersonic values at larger radii (40 arcmin) and an injection scale Linj ≈ 500 kpc. Such properties are consistent with driving due to mergers, in particular tied to internal galaxy groups. The large pressure fluctuations show that Coma is in adiabatic mode (mediated by sound waves), rather than isobaric mode (mediated by buoyancy waves). As predicted by turbulence models, the distribution of SZ fluctuations is lognormal with mild non-Gaussianities (heavy tails). The substantial non-thermal pressure support implies hydrostatic mass bias bM = −15 to −45 per cent from the core to the outskirt region, respectively. While total SZ power probes the thermal energy content, the SZ fluctuations constrain the non-thermal deviations important for precision cosmology. The proposed, novel approach can be exploited by multifrequency observations using ground-based interferometers and future space cosmic microwave background missions.},

We introduce a simple modification for autoencoder neural networks that yields powerful generative models. Our method masks the autoencoder’s parameters to respect autoregressive constraints: each input is reconstructed only from previous inputs in a given ordering. Constrained this way, the autoencoder outputs can be interpreted as a set of conditional probabilities, and their product, the full joint probability. We can also train a single network that can decompose the joint probability in multiple different orderings. Our simple framework can be applied to multiple architectures, including deep ones. Vectorized implementations, such as on GPUs, are simple and fast. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art tractable distribution estimators. At test time, the method is significantly faster and scales better than other autoregressive estimators.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size 
ϵ
ϵ
 and a desired number of steps 
L
L
. In particular, if 
L
L
 is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if 
L
L
 is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps 
L
L
. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter

 on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient âturnkeyâ samplers.},

In the local universe, these phenomena are still active in the outer regions of massive clusters (R {\textgreater} R500), where the matter distribution is expected to become clumpy and asymmetric because of the presence of accreting structures. We present the XMM-Newton cluster outskirts project (X-COP), which targets the outer regions of a sample of 13 massive clusters (M500 {\textgreater} 3 × 1014M⊙) in the redshift range 0.04–0.1 at uniform depth. The sample was selected based on the signal-to-noise ratio in the Planck Sunyaev–Zeldovich (SZ) survey with the aim of combining high-quality X-ray and SZ constraints throughout the entire cluster volume. Our observing strategy allows us to reach a sensitivity of 3 × 10− 16 ergs cm− 1 s− 1 arcmin− 2 in the 0.5–2.0 keV range thanks to a good control of systematic uncertainties. The combination of depth and field of view achieved in X-COP will allow us to pursue the following main goals: (a) measure the distribution of entropy and thermal energy to an unprecedented level of precision; (b) assess the presence of nonthermal pressure support in cluster outskirts; and (c) study the occurrence and mass distribution of infalling gas clumps. We illustrate the capabilities of the program with a pilot study on the cluster Abell 2142.},

	abstract = {X-ray observations of the hot gas ﬁlling the intra-cluster medium (ICM) provide a wealth of information on the dynamics of clusters of galaxies. The global equilibrium of the ICM is believed to be ensured by non-thermal and thermal pressure support sources, among which gas movements and the dissipation of energy through turbulent motions. Accurate mapping of turbulence using X-ray emission lines is challenging due to the lack of spatially resolved spectroscopy. Only future instruments such as the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) on Athena will have the spatial and spectral resolution to quantitatively investigate the ICM turbulence over a broad range of spatial scales. Powerful diagnostics for these studies are line shift and the line broadening maps, and the second-order structure function. When estimating these quantities, instruments will be limited by uncertainties of their measurements, and by the sampling variance (also known as cosmic variance) of the observation. Here, we extend the formalism started in our companion Paper I to include the eﬀect of statistical uncertainties of measurements in the estimation of these line diagnostics, in particular for structure functions. We demonstrate that statistics contribute to the total variance through diﬀerent terms, which depend on the geometry of the detector, the spatial binning and the nature of the turbulent ﬁeld. These terms are particularly important when probing the small scales of the turbulence. An application of these equations is performed for the X-IFU, using synthetic turbulent velocity maps of a Coma-like cluster. Results are in excellent agreement with the formulas both for the structure function estimation (≤3\%) and its variance (≤10\%). The expressions derived here and in Paper I are generic, and ensure an estimation of the total errors in any X-ray measurement of turbulent structure functions. They also open the way for optimisations in the upcoming instrumentation and in observational strategies.},

We considered the model of a “turbulent gas cloud”, consisting in isotropic and uniform turbulence described by a universal Kolmogorov power-spectrum with random amplitudes and phases in an optically thin medium. Following a simple prescription for the four-term correlation of Fourier coeﬃcients, we derived generic expressions for the sample mean and variance of line centroid shift, line broadening, and projected velocity structure function. We performed a numerical validation based on Monte-Carlo simulations for two popular models of gas emissivity based on the β-model.
Results. Generic expressions for the sample variance of line centroid shifts and broadening in arbitrary apertures are derived and match the simulations within their range of applicability. Generic expressions for the mean and variance of the structure function are provided and veriﬁed against simulations. An application to the Athena/X-IFU (Advanced Telescope for High-ENergy Astrophysics/X-ray Integral Field Unit) and XRISM/Resolve (X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) instruments forecasts the potential of sensitive, spatially-resolved spectroscopy to probe the inertial range of turbulent velocity cascades in a Coma-like galaxy cluster.
Conclusions. The formulas provided are of generic relevance and can be implemented in forecasts for upcoming or current X-ray instrumentation and observing programmes.},

	abstract = {Many recent works on the observed galaxy clusters in the X-rays highlight broadly two classes of exclusive energy carriers – sound waves and turbulence. In order to understand this dichotomy, we design an idealized three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a cluster, to assess which of these carriers can dissipate energy in and around the core (≳100 kpc). Specifically, we explore how gentle (long-duration outbursts) and intermediate (shorter duration outbursts) feedback modes can function efficiently mediated by compressible (sound waves) and incompressible (g modes/instabilities/turbulence) disturbances. Since g modes are confined tightly to the central core, we attempt to maximize the flux of fast sound waves to distribute the feedback energy over a large distance. We find that the contribution to heat dissipation from sound and turbulence varies on the basis of the aforementioned feedback modes, namely: turbulence contributes relatively more than sound in the slow-piston regime and vice versa for the intermediate regime. For the first time in a 3D simulation, we show that up to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 20\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ (in some directions) of the injected power can be carried away by sound flux in the intermediate feedback but it reduces to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10 \{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ (in some directions) in the slow-piston regime. Lastly, we find that sound waves can be elusive if we deduce the equation of state (isobaric/isentropic) of the fluctuations from X-ray observations.},

For this purpose, we apply, for the first time, the Zernike polynomial decomposition, a common analytical approach mostly used in adaptive optics to recover aberrated radiation wavefronts at the telescopes pupil plane. With this novel way, we expect to correctly infer the morphology of clusters and so possibly their dynamical state. To verify the reliability of this new approach, we use more than 300 synthetic clusters selected in the three hundred project at different redshifts ranging from 0 up to 1.03. Mock maps of the tSZ, quantified with the Compton parameter, y-maps, are modelled with Zernike polynomials inside R500, the cluster reference radius. We verify that it is possible to discriminate the morphology of each cluster by estimating the contribution of the different polynomials to the fit of the map. The results of this new method are correlated with those of a previous analysis made on the same catalogue, using two parameters that combine either morphological or dynamical-state probes. We underline that instrumental angular resolution of the maps has an impact mainly when we extend this approach to high-redshift clusters.},

	abstract = {The use of galaxy clusters as cosmological probes often relies on understanding the properties and evolution of the intracluster medium (ICM). However, the ICM is a complex plasma, regularly stirred by mergers and feedback, with non-negligible bulk and turbulent motions and a non-thermal pressure component, making it difficult to construct a coherent and comprehensive picture. To this end, we use the fable simulations to investigate how the hydrostatic mass bias is affected by mergers, turbulence, and feedback. Following in detail a single, massive cluster we find the bias varies significantly over cosmic time, rarely staying at the average value found at a particular epoch. Variations of the bias at a given radius are contemporaneous with periods where outflows dominate the mass flux, either due to mergers or interestingly, at high redshift, AGN feedback. The z = 0 ensemble median mass bias in fable is ∼13 per cent at R500 and ∼15 per cent at R200, but with a large scatter in individual values. In halo central regions, we see an increase in temperature and a decrease in non-thermal pressure support with cosmic time as turbulence thermalizes, leading to a reduction in the mass bias within \${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}!0.2 {\textbackslash}, R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{200\}\$. When using a fitted pressure profile, instead of the simulation data, to estimate the bias, we find there can be significant differences, particularly at larger radii and higher redshift. We therefore caution over the use of such fits in future work when comparing with the next generation of X-ray and SZ observations.},

Here we report observations of four clusters whose radio halos are embedded in much more extended, diffuse radio emission, filling a volume 30 times larger than that of radio halos. The emissivity in these larger features is about 20 times lower than the emissivity in radio halos. We conclude that relativistic electrons and magnetic fields extend far beyond radio halos, and that the physical conditions in the outer regions of the clusters are quite different from those in the radio halos.},

	abstract = {The fundamental properties of the postulated dark matter (DM) affect the internal structure of gravitationally bound structures. In the cold dark matter paradigm, DM particles interact only via gravity. Their distribution is well represented by an Einasto profile with shape parameter {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≈ 0.18 in the smallest dwarf galaxies or the most massive galaxy clusters alike. Conversely, if DM particles self-interact via additional forces, we expect the mass density profiles of DM halos to flatten in their central regions, thereby increasing the Einasto shape parameter. We measured the structural properties of 12 massive galaxy clusters from observations of their hot gaseous atmosphere, using the X-ray observatory {\textless}i{\textgreater}XMM-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, and of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect using the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} all-sky survey. After removing morphologically disturbed systems, we measured Einasto shape parameters with mean ⟨{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}⟩=0.19 ± 0.03 and intrinsic scatter {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.06, which is in close agreement with the prediction of the cold dark matter paradigm. We used cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation with self-interacting DM (BAHAMAS-SIDM) to determine how the Einasto shape parameter depends on the self-interaction cross section. We used the fitted relation to turn our measurements of {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} into constraints on the self-interaction cross section, which imply {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.19 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} g{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} (95\% confidence level) at collision velocity {\textless}i{\textgreater}v{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DM − DM{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ∼ 1000 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {We have designed a simple multi-scale method that identiﬁes turbulent motions in hydrodynamical grid simulations. The method does not assume any a priori coherence scale to distinguish laminar and turbulent ﬂows. Instead, the local mean velocity ﬁeld around each cell is reconstructed with a multi-scale ﬁltering technique, yielding the maximum scale of turbulent eddies by means of iterations. The method is robust, fast, and easily applicable to any grid simulation. We present here the application of this technique to the study of spatial and spectral properties of turbulence in the intra-cluster medium, measuring turbulent diﬀusion and anisotropy of the turbulent velocity ﬁeld for a variety of driving mechanisms: a) accretion of matter in galaxy clusters (simulated with ENZO); b) sloshing motions around cool-cores (simulated with FLASH); c) jet outﬂows from active galactic nuclei (AGN, simulated with FLASH). The turbulent velocities driven by matter accretion in galaxy clusters are mostly tangential in the inner regions (inside the cluster virial radius) and isotropic in regions close to the virial radius. The same is found for turbulence excited by cool-core sloshing, while the jet outﬂowing from AGN drives mostly radial turbulence motions near its sonic point and beyond. Turbulence leads to a diﬀusivity in the range Dturb ∼ 1029−1030 cm2 s−1 in the intra-cluster medium. On average, the energetically dominant mechanism of turbulence driving in the intra cluster medium is represented by accretion of matter and major mergers during cluster evolution.},

We find that halo ellipticity is strongly correlated with halo properties that serve as proxies of halo formation history, such as halo concentration and the normalized peak-centroid offset. These correlations are nearly independent of the halo density peak height. We present a simple model for the correlation between halo ellipticity and concentration using conditional abundance matching, and provide fitting formulae for the multidimensional distributions of triaxial halo shape as a function of halo peak height. We apply our halo shape model to gauge the effects of halo ellipticity and orientation bias on the excess surface mass density profiles in cluster-sized haloes. Our model should be useful for exploring the impact of triaxial halo shape on cosmological constraints in upcoming weak lensing surveys of galaxy clusters.},

The Hitomi measurements of gas motions in the core of the Perseus Cluster have provided new insights into the physics in galaxy clusters. The XARM mission, equipped with the Resolve X-ray micro-calorimeter, will continue Hitomi’s legacy by measuring ICM motions through Doppler shifting and broadening of emission lines in a larger number of galaxy clusters, and at larger radii. In this work, we investigate how well we can measure bulk and turbulent gas motions in the ICM with XARM, by analyzing mock XARM simulations of galaxy clusters extracted from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We assess how photon counts, spectral fitting methods, multiphase ICM structure, deprojections, and region selection affect the measurements of gas motions. We first show that XARM is capable of recovering the underlying spherically averaged turbulent and bulk velocity profiles for dynamically relaxed clusters to within ∼50\% with a reasonable amount of photon counts in the X-ray emission lines. We also find that there are considerable azimuthal variations in the ICM velocities, where the velocities measured in a single azimuthal direction can significantly deviate from the true value even in dynamically relaxed systems. Such variation must be taken into account when interpreting data and developing observing strategies. We will discuss the prospect of using the upcoming XARM mission to measure non-thermal pressure and to correct for the hydrostatic mass bias of galaxy clusters. Our results are broadly applicable for future X-ray missions, such as Athena and Lynx.},

The entropy, thermal pressure, and hydrostatic mass profiles of the cluster sample and the level of the non-thermal pressure component in the cluster outskirts are determined combining the deprojected temperature profile with the stacked electron gas density profile corrected for clumpiness. The first analysis gives results in good agreement with those reported in Ghirardini et al.: a modest presence of the non-thermal support and an entropy profile that follows at distances beyond r500 the predicted power law increase with slope 1.1. On the contrary, the results of the second analysis are consistent with the findings obtained by the Suzaku observations, steep temperature, and flat entropy profiles, with a higher level of the non-thermal pressure component in agreement with the values derived by numerical simulations. The conclusion is that a steep temperature profile could be present in the outskirts of the X-COP cluster sample instead of the flatter temperature profile reported by SZ observations.},

	abstract = {The degree of turbulent pressure support by residual gas motions in galaxy clusters is not well known. Mass modelling of combined X-ray and Sunyaev–Zel’dovich observations provides an estimate of turbulent pressure support in the outer regions of several galaxy clusters. Here, we test two different ﬁltering techniques to disentangle bulk from turbulent motions in nonradiative high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters using the cosmological hydrocode ENZO. We ﬁnd that the radial behaviour of the ratio of non-thermal pressure to total gas pressure as a function of cluster-centric distance can be described by a simple polynomial function. The typical non-thermal pressure support in the centre of clusters is ∼5 per cent, increasing to ∼15 per cent in the outskirts, in line with the pressure excess found in recent Xray observations. While the complex dynamics of the intracluster medium makes it impossible to reconstruct a simple correlation between turbulent motions and hydrostatic bias, we ﬁnd that a relation between them can be established using the median properties of a sample of objects. Moreover, we estimate the contribution of radial accelerations to the non-thermal pressure support and conclude that it decreases moving outwards from 40 per cent (in the core) to 15 per cent (in the cluster’s outskirts). Adding this contribution to one provided by turbulence, we show that it might account for the entire observed hydrostatic bias in the innermost regions of the clusters, and for less than 80 per cent of it at r {\textgreater} 0.8 r200,m.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the level of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) in the intracluster medium of simulated galaxy clusters, extracted from state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations performed with the Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamic code GADGET-3. These simulations include several physical processes, among which are stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback, and have been performed with an improved version of the code that allows for a better description of hydrodynamical instabilities and gas mixing processes. Evaluating the radial balance between the gravitational and hydrodynamical forces via the gas accelerations generated, we effectively examine the level of HE in every object of the sample and its dependence on the radial distance from the center and on the classification of the cluster in terms of either cool-coreness or dynamical state. We find an average deviation of 10\%–20\% out to the virial radius, with no evident distinction between cool-core and non-cool-core clusters. Instead, we observe a clear separation between regular and disturbed systems, with a more significant deviation from HE for the disturbed objects. The investigation of the bias between the hydrostatic estimate and the total gravitating mass indicates that, on average, this traces the deviation from HE very well, even though individual cases show a more complex picture. Typically, in the radial ranges where mass bias and deviation from HE are substantially different, the gas is characterized by a significant amount of random motions (), relative to thermal ones. As a general result, the HE-deviation and mass bias, at a given distance from the cluster center, are not very sensitive to the temperature inhomogeneities in the gas.},

	abstract = {Methods. We performed realistic simulations of lensing and X-ray observations that were subsequently analyzed using observational techniques. The resulting mass estimates were compared with the input models. Three clusters obtained from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, each of which projected along three independent lines-of-sight, were used for this analysis.
Results. We ﬁnd that strong lensing models can be trusted over a limited region around the cluster core. Extrapolating the strong lensing mass models to outside the Einstein ring can lead to signiﬁcant biases in the mass estimates, if the BCG is not modeled properly, for example. Weak-lensing mass measurements can be strongly aﬀected by substructures, depending on the method implemented to convert the shear into a mass estimate. Using nonparametric methods which combine weak and strong lensing data, the projected masses within R200 can be constrained with a precision of ∼10\%. Deprojection of lensing masses increases the scatter around the true masses by more than a factor of two because of cluster triaxiality. X-ray mass measurements have much smaller scatter (about a factor of two less than the lensing masses), but they are generally biased toward low values between 5 and 10\%. This bias is entirely ascribable to bulk motions in the gas of our simulated clusters. Using the lensing and the X-ray masses as proxies for the true and the hydrostatic equilibrium masses of the simulated clusters and by averaging over the cluster sample, we are able to measure the lack of hydrostatic equilibrium in the systems we have investigated.
Conclusions. Although the comparison between lensing and X-ray masses may be diﬃcult in individual systems due to triaxiality and substructures, using a large number of clusters with both lensing and X-ray observations may lead to important information about their gas physics and allow use of lensing masses to calibrate the X-ray scaling relations.},

Together with the redshift, the mass links observation and theory, allowing us to use the cluster population to test models of structure formation and to constrain cosmological parameters. Building on the rich heritage from X-ray surveys, new results from Sunyaev-Zeldovich and optical surveys have stimulated a resurgence of interest in cluster cosmology. These studies have generally found fewer clusters than predicted by the baseline Planck\${\textbackslash}varLambda\$CDM model, prompting a renewed effort on the part of the community to obtain a definitive measure of the true cluster mass scale. Here we review recent progress on this front. Our theoretical understanding continues to advance, with numerical simulations being the cornerstone of this effort. On the observational side, new, sophisticated techniques are being deployed in individual mass measurements and to account for selection biases in cluster surveys. We summarise the state of the art in cluster mass estimation methods and the systematic uncertainties and biases inherent in each approach, which are now well identified and understood, and explore how current uncertainties propagate into the cosmological parameter analysis. We discuss the prospects for improvements to the measurement of the mass scale using upcoming multi-wavelength data, and the future use of the cluster population as a cosmological probe.},

	abstract = {The use of galaxy clusters as cosmological probes hinges on our ability to measure their masses accurately and with high precision. Hydrostatic mass is one of the most common methods for estimating the masses of individual galaxy clusters, which suffer from biases due to departures from hydrostatic equilibrium. Using a large, mass-limited sample of massive galaxy clusters from a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, in this work we show that in addition to turbulent and bulk gas velocities, acceleration of gas introduces biases in the hydrostatic mass estimate of galaxy clusters. In unrelaxed clusters, the acceleration bias is comparable to the bias due to non-thermal pressure associated with merger-induced turbulent and bulk gas motions. In relaxed clusters, the mean mass bias due to acceleration is small (≲ 3\%), but the scatter in the mass bias can be reduced by accounting for gas acceleration. Additionally, this acceleration bias is greater in the outskirts of higher redshift clusters where mergers are more frequent and clusters are accreting more rapidly. Since gas acceleration cannot be observed directly, it introduces an irreducible bias for hydrostatic mass estimates. This acceleration bias places limits on how well we can recover cluster masses from future X-ray and microwave observations. We discuss implications for cluster mass estimates based on X-ray, Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect, and gravitational lensing observations and their impact on cluster cosmology.},

We investigate effects of the residual subsonic gas motions on the hydrostatic estimates of mass profiles and concentrations of galaxy clusters. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the gas motions contribute up to ≈5\%–15\% of the total pressure support in relaxed clusters with contribution increasing with the cluster-centric radius. The fractional pressure support is higher in unrelaxed systems. This contribution would not be accounted for in hydrostatic estimates of the total mass profile and would lead to systematic underestimate of mass. We demonstrate that total mass can be recovered accurately if pressure due to gas motions measured in simulations is explicitly taken into account in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium. Given that the underestimate of mass is increasing at larger radii, where gas is less relaxed and contribution of gas motions to pressure is larger, the total density profile derived from hydrostatic analysis is more concentrated than the true profile. This may at least partially explain some high values of concentrations of clusters estimated from hydrostatic analysis of X-ray data.},

While ﬁlaments are challenging to detect with X-ray observations, the higher density of clumps makes them visible and a viable tracer to study the thermodynamical proprieties of baryons undergoing accretion along cosmic web ﬁlaments onto galaxy clusters. We developed new algorithms to identify these structures and applied them to a set of non-radiative cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters at high resolution. We ﬁnd that in those simulated clusters, the density and temperature of clumps are independent of the mass of the cluster where they reside. We detected a positive correlation between the ﬁlament temperature and the host cluster mass. The density and temperature of clumps and ﬁlaments also tended to correlate. Both the temperature and density decrease moving outward. We observed that clumps are hotter, more massive, and more luminous if identiﬁed closer to the cluster center. Especially in the outermost cluster regions (∼3·R500,c or beyond), X-ray observations might already have the potential to locate cosmic ﬁlaments based on the distribution of clumps and to allow one to study the thermodynamics of diﬀuse baryons before they are processed by the intracluster medium.},

	abstract = {The gas motions in the intracluster medium (ICM) are governed by turbulence. However, since the ICM has a radial profile with the centre being denser than the outskirts, ICM turbulence is stratified. Stratified turbulence is fundamentally different from Kolmogorov (isotropic, homogeneous) turbulence; kinetic energy not only cascades from large to small scales, but it is also converted into buoyancy potential energy. To understand the density and velocity fluctuations in the ICM, we conduct high-resolution (10242 × 1536 grid points) hydrodynamical simulations of subsonic turbulence (with rms Mach number \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.25\$) and different levels of stratification, quantified by the Richardson number Ri, from Ri = 0 (no stratification) to Ri = 13 (strong stratification). We quantify the density, pressure, and velocity fields for varying stratification because observational studies often use surface brightness fluctuations to infer the turbulent gas velocities of the ICM. We find that the standard deviation of the logarithmic density fluctuations (σs), where s = ln (ρ/ \&lt; ρ(\$z\$) \&gt;), increases with Ri. For weakly stratified subsonic turbulence (Ri ≲ 10, \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}{\textbackslash}lt 1\$), we derive a new σs–\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}\$–Ri relation, \${\textbackslash}sigma \_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ s\}{\textasciicircum}2={\textbackslash}ln (1+b{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}{\textasciicircum}4+0.09{\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Ri\} H\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ P\}/H\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ S\})\$, where b = 1/3–1 is the turbulence driving parameter, and HP and HS are the pressure and entropy scale heights, respectively. We further find that the power spectrum of density fluctuations, P(ρk/ \&lt; ρ \&gt;), increases in magnitude with increasing Ri. Its slope in k-space flattens with increasing Ri before steepening again for Ri ≳ 1. In contrast to the density spectrum, the velocity power spectrum is invariant to changes in the stratification. Thus, we find that the ratio between density and velocity power spectra strongly depends on Ri, with the total power in density and velocity fluctuations described by our σs–\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}\$–Ri relation. Pressure fluctuations, on the other hand, are independent of stratification and only depend on \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}\$.},

	abstract = {Turbulent gas motions are observed in the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM is density-stratified, with the gas density being highest at the centre of the cluster and decreasing radially outwards. As a result of this, Kolmogorov (homogeneous, isotropic) turbulence theory does not apply to the ICM. The gas motions are instead explained by anisotropic stratified turbulence, with the stratification quantified by the perpendicular Froude number (Fr⊥). These turbulent motions are associated with density and pressure fluctuations, which manifest as perturbations in X-ray surface brightness maps of the ICM and as thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect (SZ) fluctuations, respectively. In order to advance our understanding of the relations between these fluctuations and the turbulent gas velocities, we have conducted 100 high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of stratified turbulence (2562 × 384–10242 × 1536 resolution elements), in which we scan the parameter space of subsonic rms Mach number (\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}\$), Fr⊥, and the ratio of entropy and pressure scale heights (RPS = HP/HS), relevant to the ICM. We develop a new scaling relation between the standard deviation of logarithmic density fluctuations (σs, where s = ln (ρ/\${\textbackslash}langle\$ρ\${\textbackslash}rangle\$)), \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}\$, and Fr⊥, which covers both the strongly stratified (Fr⊥ ≪ 1) and weakly stratified (Fr⊥ ≫ 1) turbulence regimes: \${\textbackslash}sigma \_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}{\textasciicircum}2={\textbackslash}ln (1+b{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}{\textasciicircum}4+0.10/({\textbackslash}mathrm\{Fr\}\_{\textbackslash}perp +0.25/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Fr\}\_{\textbackslash}perp \}){\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}{\textasciicircum}2R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm PS\})\$, where b ∼ 1/3 for solenoidal turbulence driving studied here.

However, the exact nature of turbulence forced by these sources and its impact on the different statistical properties of the CGM/ICM and their global thermodynamics is still unclear. To investigate the effects of different types of forcing, we conduct high-resolution (10083 resolution elements) idealized hydrodynamic simulations with purely solenoidal (divergence-free) forcing, purely compressive (curl-free) forcing, and natural mixture forcing (equal fractions of the two components). The simulations also include radiative cooling. We study the impact of the three different forcing modes (sol, comp, and mix) on the morphology of the gas, its temperature and density distributions, sources and sinks of enstrophy, i.e. solenoidal motions, as well as the kinematics of hot (∼107 K) X-ray emitting and cold (∼104 K) H α emitting gas. We find that compressive forcing leads to stronger variations in density and temperature of the gas as compared to solenoidal forcing. The cold phase gas forms large-scale filamentary structures for compressive forcing and misty, small-scale clouds for solenoidal forcing. The cold phase gas has stronger large-scale velocities for compressive forcing. The natural mixture forcing shows kinematics and gas distributions intermediate between the two extremes, the cold-phase gas occurs as both large-scale filaments and small-scale misty clouds.},

Our results span the approximate radial range 0.015–0.4 R200m (∼35–1000 kpc). At cluster-centric radii smaller than 0.1 R200m the ensemble average Pnt/Ptot is consistent with zero with an upper limit of 9 per cent, indicating that heating from active galactic nuclei and other relevant processes does not produce signiﬁcant deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE). The ensemble average Pnt/Ptot increases outside of this radius to approximately 20 per cent at 0.4 R200m, as expected from simulations, due to newly accreted material thermalizing via a series of shocks. Also in agreement with simulations, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant cluster-to-cluster variation in Pnt/Ptot and little difference in the ensemble average Pnt/Ptot based on dynamical state. We conclude that on average, even for diverse samples, HSE-derived masses in the very central regions of galaxy clusters require only modest corrections due to non-thermal motions.},

	abstract = {Cosmological constraints from X-ray and microwave observations of galaxy clusters are subjected to systematic uncertainties. Non-thermal pressure support due to internal gas motions in galaxy clusters is one of the major sources of astrophysical uncertainties. Using a mass-limited sample of galaxy clusters from a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, we characterize the non-thermal pressure fraction proﬁle and study its dependence on redshift, mass, and mass accretion rate. We ﬁnd that the non-thermal pressure fraction proﬁle is universal across redshift when galaxy cluster radii are deﬁned with respect to the mean matter density of the universe instead of the commonly used critical density. We also ﬁnd that the non-thermal pressure is predominantly radial, and the gas velocity anisotropy proﬁle exhibits strong universality when galaxy cluster radii are deﬁned with respect to the mean matter density of the universe. However, we ﬁnd that the non-thermal pressure fraction is strongly dependent on the mass accretion rate of the galaxy cluster. We provide ﬁtting formulae for the universal non-thermal pressure fraction and velocity anisotropy proﬁles of gas in galaxy clusters, which should be useful in modeling astrophysical uncertainties pertinent to using galaxy clusters as cosmological probes.},

We present the results from recent observations of A2319 at ∼20 cm with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and a re-analysis of the X-ray observations from XMM–Newton, to investigate the interactions between the thermal and non-thermal components of the intracluster medium. We confirm previous reports of an X-ray cold front, and identify a distinct core to the radio halo, ∼800 kpc in extent, that is strikingly similar in morphology to the X-ray emission, and drops sharply in brightness at the cold front. We also detect radio emission trailing off from the core that blends smoothly into the ∼2 Mpc halo detected with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We speculate on the possible mechanisms for such a two-component radio halo, with sloshing playing a dominant role in the core. By directly comparing the X-ray and radio emission, we find that a hadronic origin for the cosmic ray electrons responsible for the radio halo would require a magnetic field and/or cosmic ray proton distribution that increases with radial distance from the cluster centre, and is therefore disfavoured.},

	abstract = {In the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxies, exchanges of heat across magnetic field lines are strongly suppressed. This anisotropic heat conduction, in the presence of a large-scale temperature gradient, destabilizes the outskirts of galaxy clusters via the magneto-thermal instability (MTI), and thus supplies a source of observed ICM turbulence. In this paper we continue our investigation of the MTI with 3D simulations using the Boussinesq code SNOOPY. We redress two issues intrinsic to our previous 2D study: an inverse energy cascade and the impossibility of dynamo action. Contrary to 2D simulations, we find inconsequential transport of energy across scales (most energy is dissipated at the same scale as its injection), and that turbulent eddies are vertically elongated at or below the thermal conduction length, but relatively isotropic on larger scales. Similar to 2D, however, the saturated turbulent energy levels and the integral scale follow clear power-laws that depend on the thermal diffusivity, temperature gradient, and buoyancy frequency. We also show that the MTI amplifies magnetic fields, through a fluctuation dynamo, to equipartition strengths provided that the integral scale of MTI turbulence is larger than the viscous dissipation scale. Finally, we show that our scaling laws are consistent with extant observations of ICM turbulence if the thermal conductivity is reduced by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ from its Spitzer value, and that on global cluster scales the stable stratification significantly reduces the vertical elongation of MTI motions.},

Analyzing Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations of the galaxy cluster Abell 2255, we show evidence of radio synchrotron emission distributed over very large scales of at least 5 megaparsec. The pervasive radio emission witnesses that shocks and turbulence efficiently transfer kinetic energy into relativistic particles and magnetic fields in a region that extends up to the cluster outskirts. The strength of the emission requires a magnetic field energy density at least 100 times higher than expected from a simple compression of primordial fields, presumably implying that dynamo operates efficiently also in the cluster periphery. It also suggests that nonthermal components may contribute substantially to the pressure of the intracluster medium in the cluster periphery.},

In this work, we focus on the innermost region of the cluster. Among the numerous interesting features observed, we discover remarkable bright and filamentary structures embedded in the radio halo. We incorporate archival WSRT 1.2 GHz data to study the spectral properties of the diffuse synchrotron emission and find a very complex spectral index distribution in the halo spanning a wide range of values. We combine the radio data with Chandra observations to investigate the connection between the thermal and non-thermal components by quantitatively comparing the radio and X-ray surface brightness and the spectral index of the radio emission with the thermodynamical quantities of the ICM. Despite the multitude of structures observed in the radio halo, we find that the X-ray and radio emission are overall well correlated. The fact that the steepest spectrum emission is located in the cluster center and traces regions with high entropy possibly suggests the presence of seed particles injected by radio galaxies that are spread in the ICM by turbulence generating the extended radio halo.},

	title = {{THE} {PROMISE} {OF} {BAYESIAN} {INFERENCE} {FOR} {ASTROPHYSICS}},
	abstract = {The ‘frequentist’ approach to statistics, currently dominating statistical practice in astrophysics, is compared to the historically older Bayesian approach, which is now growing in popularity in other scientiﬁc disciplines, and which provides unique, optimal solutions to well-posed problems. The two approaches address the same questions with very diﬀerent calculations, but in simple cases often give the same ﬁnal results, confusing the issue of whether one is superior to the other. Here frequentist and Bayesian methods are applied to problems where such a mathematical coincidence does not occur, allowing assessment of their relative merits based on their performance, rather than on philosophical argument. Emphasis is placed on a key distinction between the two approaches: Bayesian methods, based on comparisons among alternative hypotheses using the single observed data set, consider averages over hypotheses; frequentist methods, in contrast, average over hypothetical alternative data samples, and consider hypothesis averaging to be irrelevant. Simple problems are presented that magnify the consequences of this distinction to where common sense can conﬁdently judge between the methods. These demonstrate the irrelevance of sample averaging, and the necessity of hypothesis averaging, revealing frequentist methods to be fundamentally ﬂawed. To illustrate how Bayesian and frequentist methods diﬀer in more complicated, astrophysically relevant problems, Bayesian methods for problems using the Poisson distribution are described, including the analysis of ‘on/oﬀ’ measurements of a weak source in a strong background, and the analysis of time series resulting from recording event arrival times. Weaknesses of the presently used frequentist methods for these problems are straightforwardly overcome using Bayesian methods. Additional existing applications of Bayesian inference to astrophysical problems are noted.},

	abstract = {Bayesian Inference is a powerful approach to data analysis that is based almost entirely on probability theory. In this approach, probabilities model \{{\textbackslash}it uncertainty\} rather than randomness or variability. This thesis is composed of a series of papers that have been published in various astronomical journals during the years 2005-2008. The unifying thread running through the papers is the use of Bayesian Inference to solve underdetermined inverse problems in astrophysics. Firstly, a methodology is developed to solve a question in gravitational lens inversion - using the observed images of gravitational lens systems to reconstruct the undistorted source profile and the mass profile of the lensing galaxy. A similar technique is also applied to the task of inferring the number and frequency of modes of oscillation of a star from the time series observations that are used in the field of asteroseismology. For these complex problems, many of the required calculations cannot be done analytically, and so Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms have been used. Finally, probabilistic reasoning is applied to a controversial question in astrobiology: does the fact that life formed quite soon after the Earth constitute evidence that the formation of life is quite probable, given the right macroscopic conditions?},

We resolve the clumpiness of the gas density to be below 20\% over the entire observed volume. We also demonstrate that most of this clumpiness originates from the ongoing merger and can be associated with large-scale inhomogeneities (the “residual” clumpiness). We estimate the total mass through the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. This analysis is done both in azimuthally averaged radial bins and in eight independent angular sectors, enabling us to study in detail the azimuthal variance of the recovered properties.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Given the exquisite quality of the X-ray and SZ datasets, their radial extension, and their complementarity, we constrain at {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}200{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} the total hydrostatic mass, modelled with a Navarro–Frenk–White profile at very high precision ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}200{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 10.7 ± 0.5{\textless}sup{\textgreater}stat.{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} ± 0.9{\textless}sup{\textgreater}syst.{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}). We identify the ongoing merger and how it is affecting differently the gas properties in the resolved azimuthal sectors. We have several indications that the merger has injected a high level of non-thermal pressure in this system: the clumping free density profile is above the average profile obtained by stacking Rosat/PSPC observations; the gas mass fraction recovered using our hydrostatic mass profile exceeds the expected cosmic gas fraction beyond {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}; the pressure profile is flatter than the fit obtained by the Planck Collaboration; the entropy profile is flatter than the mean profile predicted from non-radiative simulations; the analysis in azimuthal sectors has revealed that these deviations occur in a preferred region of the cluster.

	abstract = {We demonstrate a novel technique for calibrating the energy scale of the EPIC-pn detector on XMM-Newton, which allows us to measure bulk ﬂows in the intracluster medium (ICM) of the Perseus and Coma galaxy clusters. The procedure uses the ﬂuorescent instrumental background lines present in all observations, in particular, Cu-Kα. By studying their spatial and temporal variations, in addition to incorporating calibration observations, we reﬁned the absolute energy scale of the detector to better than 150 km s−1 at the Fe-K line, a large improvement over the nominal calibration accuracy of 550 km s−1. With our calibration, we mapped the bulk motions over much of the central 1200 and 800 kpc of Perseus and Coma, respectively, in spatial regions down to 65 and 140 kpc size. We cross-checked our procedure by comparing our measurements with those found in Perseus by Hitomi for an overlapping 65 kpc square region, ﬁnding consistent results. For Perseus, there is a relative line-of-sight velocity increase of 480 ± 210 km s−1 (1σ) at a radius of 250 kpc east of the nucleus. This region is associated with a cold front, providing direct evidence of the ICM sloshing in the cluster potential well. Assuming the intrinsic distribution of bulk motions is Gaussian, its width is 214 ± 85 km s−1, excluding systematic uncertainties. Removing the sloshing region, this is reduced to 20–150 km s−1, which is similar in magnitude to the Hitomi line width measurements in undisturbed regions. In Coma, the line-of-sight velocity of the ICM varies between the velocities of the two central galaxies. Maps of the gas velocity and metallicity provide clues about the merger history of the Coma, with material to the north and east of the cluster core having a velocity similar to NGC 4874, while that to the south and west has velocities close to NGC 4889. Our results highlight the diﬀerence between a merging system, such as Coma, where we observe a ∼1000 km s−1 range in velocity, and a relatively relaxed system, such as Perseus, with much weaker bulk motions.},

Results. We ﬁnd that gas density and pressure proﬁles steepen steadily with radius, in excellent agreement with previous observational results.

The scatter in all thermodynamical quantities reaches a minimum in the range [0.2−0.8]R500 and increases outward.

Conclusions. Our results indicate that once accreting substructures are properly excised, the properties of the ICM beyond the cooling region (R {\textgreater} 0.3R500) follow remarkably well the predictions of simple gravitational collapse and require few non-gravitational corrections.},

	abstract = {We use the MACSIS hydrodynamical simulations to estimate the extent of gas clumping in the intracluster medium of massive galaxy clusters and how it affects the hydrostatic mass bias. By comparing the clumping to the azimuthal scatter in the emission measure, an observational proxy, we find that they both increase with radius and are larger in higher-mass and dynamically perturbed systems. Similar trends are also seen for the azimuthal temperature scatter and non-thermal pressure fraction, both of which correlate with density fluctuations, with these values also increasing with redshift. However, in agreement with recent work, we find only a weak correlation between the clumping, or its proxies, and the hydrostatic mass bias. To reduce the effect of clumping in the projected profiles, we compute the azimuthal median following recent observational studies, and find this reduces the scatter in the bias. We also attempt to correct the cluster masses by using a non-thermal pressure term and find over-corrected mass estimates (\$1-b=0.86\$ to \$1-b=1.15\$) from 3D gas profiles but improved mass estimates (\$1-b=0.75\$ to \$1-b=0.85\$) from projected gas profiles. We conclude that the cluster-averaged mass bias is minimised from applying a non-thermal pressure correction (\$1-b=0.85\$) with more modest reductions from selecting clusters that have low clumping (\$1-b=0.79\$) or are dynamically relaxed (\$1-b=0.80\$). However, the latter selection is most effective at minimising the scatter for individual objects. Such results can be tested with next generation X-ray missions equipped with high-resolution spectrometers such as Athena.},

	abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by the central Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs) play a major role in modifying the thermal properties of the intracluster medium (ICM). In this work, we implement two AGN heating models: (i) by buoyant cavities rising through stratified ICM (effervescent model) and, (ii) by viscous and conductive dissipation of sound waves (acoustic model). Our aim is to determine whether these heating models are consistent with ICM observables and if one is preferred over the other. We assume an initial entropy profile of ICM that is expected from the purely gravitational infall of the gas in the potential of the dark matter halo. We then incorporate heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction to study the evolution of ICM over the age of the clusters. Our results are: (i) Both the heating processes can produce comparable thermal profiles of the ICM with some tuning of relevant parameters. (ii) Thermal conduction is crucially important, even at the level of 10{\textbackslash}\% of the Spitzer values, in transferring the injected energy beyond the central regions, and without which the temperature/entropy profiles are unrealistically high. (iii) The required injected AGN power scales with cluster mass as \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textasciicircum}\{1.5\}\$ for both models. (iv) The required AGN luminosity is comparable with the observed radio jet power, reinforcing the idea that AGNs are the dominant heating source in clusters. (v) Finally, we estimate that the fraction of the total AGN luminosity available as the AGN mechanical luminosity at \$0.02r\_\{500\}\$ is less than 0.05{\textbackslash}\%.},

	abstract = {In the self-similar scenario for galaxy cluster formation and evolution, the thermodynamic properties of the X-ray emitting plasma can be predicted in their dependencies on the halo mass and redshift only. However, several departures from this simple self-similar scenario have been observed. We show how our semi-analytic model \$i(cm)z\$, which modifies the self-similar predictions through two temperature-dependent quantities, the gas mass fraction \$f\_g=f\_0 T{\textasciicircum}\{f\_1\} E\_z{\textasciicircum}\{f\_z\}\$ and the temperature variation \$f\_T=t\_0 T{\textasciicircum}\{t\_1\} E\_z{\textasciicircum}\{t\_z\}\$, can be calibrated to incorporate the mass and redshift dependencies. We used a published set of 17 scaling relations to constrain the parameters of the model. We were subsequently able to make predictions as to the slope of any observed scaling relation within a few percent of the central value and about one \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ of the nominal error. Contextually, the evolution of these scaling laws was also determined, with predictions within \$1.5 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ and within 10 percent of the observational constraints. Relying on this calibration, we have also evaluated the consistency of the predictions on the radial profiles with some observational datasets. For a sample of high-quality data (X-COP), we were able to constrain a further parameter of the model, the hydrostatic bias \$b\$. By calibrating the model, we have determined that (i) the slopes of the temperature dependence are \$f\_1=0.403 ({\textbackslash}pm0.009)\$ and \$t\_1=0.144 ({\textbackslash}pm0.017)\$; and that (ii) the dependence upon \$E\_z\$ are constrained to be \$f\_z=-0.004 ({\textbackslash}pm 0.023)\$ and \$t\_z=0.349 ({\textbackslash}pm 0.059)\$. These values permit one to estimate directly how the normalizations of a given quantity \$Q\_\{{\textbackslash}Delta\}\$ changes as a function of the mass (or temperature) and redshift halo in the form \$Q\_\{{\textbackslash}Delta\} {\textbackslash}sim M{\textasciicircum}\{a\_M\} E\_z{\textasciicircum}\{a\_z\} {\textbackslash}sim T{\textasciicircum}\{a\_T\} E\_z{\textasciicircum}\{a\_\{Tz\}\}\$, in very good agreement with the current observational constraints.},

This nearby radio galaxy shows a hybrid radio morphology and an X-ray cavity, all signatures of a turbulent past activity, potentially due to merger events and AGN outbursts. We present results of the comparison between \$Chandra\$ and VLT/MUSE data for the inner region of the galaxy cluster, on a scale of tens of kpc. We discovered H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ + [N II]\${\textbackslash}lambda6584\$ emission spatially associated with the X-ray cavity (at \${\textbackslash}sim\$10 kpc from the galaxy nucleus) instead of with its rim. This result differs from previous discoveries of ionized gas surrounding X-ray cavities in other radio galaxies harbored in galaxy clusters and could represent the first reported case of ionized gas filling an X-ray cavity, either due to different AGN outbursts or to the cooling of warm (\$10{\textasciicircum}4{\textless}T{\textbackslash}leq10{\textasciicircum}7\$ K) AGN outflows. We also found that the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, [N II]\${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lambda6548,6584\$ and [S II]\${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lambda6718,6733\$ emission lines show an additional redward component, at \${\textbackslash}sim\$1000 km\${\textbackslash},\$s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ from rest frame, with no detection in H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ or [O III]\${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}lambda4960,5008\$.

	abstract = {A classiﬁcation of the galaxy cluster’s dynamical state is crucial when dealing with large samples. The identiﬁcation of the most relaxed and most disturbed objects is necessary for both cosmological analysis, focused on spherical and virialised systems, and astrophysical studies, centred around all those micro-physical processes that take place in disturbed clusters (such as particle acceleration or turbulence). Among the most powerful tools for the identiﬁcation of the dynamical state of clusters is the analysis of their intracluster medium (ICM) distribution. In this work, we performed an analysis of the X-ray morphology of the 118 (Cluster HEritage project with XMM-Newton – Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at the Endpoint of structure formation) CHEX-MATE clusters, with the aim of providing a classiﬁcation of their dynamical state. To investigate the link between the X-ray appearance and the dynamical state, we considered four morphological parameters: the surface brightness concentration, the centroid shift, and the secondand third-order power ratios. These indicators result to be strongly correlated with each other, powerful in identifying the disturbed and relaxed population, characterised by a unimodal distribution, and not strongly inﬂuenced by systematic uncertainties. In order to obtain a continuous classiﬁcation of the CHEX-MATE objects, we combined these four parameters in a single quantity, M, which represents the grade of relaxation of a system. On the basis of the M value, we identiﬁed the most extreme systems of the sample, ﬁnding 15 very relaxed and 27 very disturbed galaxy clusters. From a comparison with previous analysis on X-ray selected samples, we conﬁrmed that the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) clusters tend to be more disturbed. Finally, by applying our analysis to a simulated sample, we found a general agreement between the observed and simulated results, with the only exception being the concentration. This latter behaviour is partially related to the presence of particles with a high smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics density in the central regions of the simulated clusters due to the action of the idealised isotropic thermal active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback.},

	abstract = {Upcoming high-redshift observations of the anisotropic distribution of diffuse gas surrounding galaxy clusters, observed through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, will help distinguish between different astrophysical feedback models, account for baryons that appear to be `missing' from the cosmic census, and potentially be used as a cosmological probe. To glean information from these observations, a typical approach is to apply a halo-model-based gas prescription to dark matter simulations or analytic predictions. This study seeks to inform such prescriptions by analysing gas in The Three Hundred Gizmo-Simba hydrodynamic simulations, investigating whether gas beyond halos is a major contributor to the anisotropic tSZ signal. Various definitions are applied to separate concentrated gas from diffuse gas at redshift \$z=1\$, and the tSZ signals from each category across 98 simulation snapshots are combined through oriented stacking along the galaxy filament axis. The results vary significantly depending on the definition used for diffuse gas, indicating that care must be taken when discussing the fraction of cosmic gas in a diffuse state. In all cases, the diffuse gas is important, contributing up to \${\textbackslash}sim50{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the tSZ signal. The unbound gas existing at 1-2 virial radii from halo centres is especially key. Oriented stacking and environmental sub-selections help to amplify the signal from the warm-hot intergalactic medium, which is aligned but less concentrated along the galaxy filament axis than the hot halo gas.},

We find two more surface brightness edges along the east direction of the eastern core and west direction of the western core of A98S. We measure the temperatures and gas densities across those edges, and find that the eastern edge appears to be a cold front while the western edge is a shock front with a Mach number of \${\textbackslash}cal\{M\}\$ \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 1.5. We detect a "tail" of X-ray emission associated with the eastern core of A98S.

	abstract = {In galaxy clusters, the hot intracluster medium (ICM) can develop a striking multi-phase structure around the brightest cluster galaxy. Much work has been done on understanding the origin of this central nebula, but less work has studied its eventual fate after the originally filamentary structure is broken into individual cold clumps. In this paper we perform a suite of 30 (magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations of kpc-scale cold clouds with typical parameters as found by galaxy cluster simulations, to understand whether clouds are mixed back into the hot ICM or can persist. We investigate the effects of radiative cooling, small-scale heating, magnetic fields, and (anisotropic) thermal conduction on the long-term evolution of clouds. We find that filament fragments cool on timescales shorter than the crushing timescale, fall out of pressure equilibrium with the hot medium, and shatter, forming smaller clumplets. These act as nucleation sites for further condensation, and mixing via Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, causing cold gas mass to double within 75 Myr. Cloud growth depends on density, as well as on local heating processes, which determine whether clouds undergo ablation- or shattering-driven evolution. Magnetic fields slow down but don't prevent cloud growth, with the evolution of both cold and warm phase sensitive to the field topology. Counter-intuitively, anisotropic thermal conduction increases the cold gas growth rate compared to non-conductive clouds, leading to larger amounts of warm phase as well. We conclude that dense clumps on scales of \$500\$ pc or more cannot be ignored when studying the long-term cooling flow evolution of galaxy clusters.},

	abstract = {We aim to investigate the AGN/ICM interplay in ZwCl 235, a galaxy cluster with high X-ray flux, an extended central radio galaxy, and evidence of multi-phase gas at its center. Using archival data from the Chandra telescope, the VLASS survey, the LOTSS survey and the VLBA telescope, we perform a complete study of ZwCl 235, dissecting the dynamics of the ICM, the thermodynamic state of the central gas, and the properties of the BCG. By means of radial profiles and 2D spectral maps, we measure the temperature, entropy and cooling time of the ICM, and we compare the morphology of the central radio galaxy with the surrounding medium. We find evidence that ZwCl 235 is a sloshing cool core cluster in which the activity of the central galaxy has excavated a pair of cavities and possibly uplifted enriched gas to an altitude of {\textasciitilde}30 kpc. In the cluster core, the lowest entropy ICM is preferentially found in a 20 kpc-long filament tangential to the southern radio lobe of the AGN. We argue that the observed cool ({\textasciitilde}1.3 keV) filament is likely produced by a combination of sloshing and stimulated ICM cooling, that may be fueling the central supermassive black hole. Additionally, we determine that the X-ray emission of the BCG originates from a {\textasciitilde}1.4 keV plasma kernel which extends for 5 kpc in radius and has a short cooling time ({\textasciitilde}240 Myr), and could represent the thermal corona of the BCG. Overall, we propose that several sources (the large scale ICM, the low entropy filament and the {\textasciitilde}1.4 keV kernel) of cold material are currently feeding the central AGN, and that the ICM cooling cycle expectations are met from the macro scales (between 5 - 100 kpc) to the meso scales ({\textless}5 kpc) of AGN feedback.},

	abstract = {Methods. We performed a detailed X-ray spectro-imaging analysis of A3408. We constructed particle-background-subtracted and exposure-corrected images and surface brightness proﬁles in different sectors. The spectral analysis was performed out to 1.4r500 and included normalization, temperature, and metallicity proﬁles determined from elliptical annuli aligned with the elongation of A3408. Additionally, a temperature map is presented that depicts the distribution of the intracluster medium (ICM) temperature. Furthermore, we make use of data from the ROSAT all-sky survey to estimate some bulk properties of A3408 and A3407, using the growth-curve analysis method and scaling relations.
Results. The imaging analysis shows the complex morphology of A3408 with a strong elongation in the SE–NW direction. This is quantiﬁed by comparing the surface brightness proﬁles of the NW, SW, SE, and NE directions, where the NW and SE directions show a signiﬁcantly higher surface brightness than the other directions. We determine a gas temperature kBT500 = (2.23 ± 0.09) keV in the range 0.2r500 to 0.5r500 from the spectral analysis. The temperature proﬁle reveals a hot core within two arcminutes of the emission Ape3a4k0,7kBaTnd=A33.40048+−00a..22r95ekfeoVun. dEmtopolovyeirnlagpainmparsosj–etcetmiopne,rwathuircehremlaatkioesn,owngeooibntgaiinntMera50c0ti=on(s9p.2l7au±si0b.l7e.5)T×he1t0w13oM-dimiteenrasitoivneally.teTmhpeerr2a0t0uoref map reveals higher temperatures in the W than in the E direction.
Conclusions. The elliptical morphology together with the temperature distribution suggests that A3408 is an unrelaxed system. The system A3407 and A3408 is likely in a pre-merger state, with some interactions already affecting the ICM thermodynamical properties. In particular, increased temperatures in the direction of A3407 indicate adiabatic compression or shocks due to the starting interaction.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The most nearby clusters are the best places for studying physical and enrichment effects in the faint cluster outskirts. The Abell 3158 cluster (A3158), located at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.059, is quite extended with a characteristic radius {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}200{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 23.95 arcmin. The metal distribution in the outskirts of this cluster has previously been studied with {\textless}i{\textgreater}XMM-Newton.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} In 2019, A3158 was observed as a calibration target in a pointed observation with the eROSITA telescope on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission. Bright large clusters, such as A3158, are ideal for studying the metal distribution in the cluster outskirts, along with the temperature profile and morphology. With the deeper observation time of the eROSITA telescope, these properties can now be studied in greater detail and at larger radii. Furthermore, bright nearby clusters are ideal X-ray instrumental cross-calibration targets as they cover a large fraction of the detector and do not vary in time.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We first compare the temperature, metal abundance, and normalisation profiles of the cluster from eROSITA with previous {\textless}i{\textgreater}XMM-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data. Following this calibration work, we investigate the temperature and metallicity of the cluster out to almost {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}200{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, measure the galaxy velocity dispersion, and determine the cluster mass. Furthermore, we search for infalling clumps and background clusters in the field.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We determined 1D temperature, abundance, and normalisation profiles from both eROSITA and {\textless}i{\textgreater}XMM-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data as well as 2D maps of temperature and metal abundance distribution from eROSITA data. The velocity dispersion was determined and the cluster mass was calculated from the mass–velocity dispersion ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}200{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}−σ{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}υ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) relation. Galaxy density maps were created to enable a better understanding of the structure of the cluster and the outskirts.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The overall (i.e. in the range 0.2−0.5{\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) temperature was measured to be 5.158 ± 0.038 keV. The temperature, abundance, and normalisation profiles of eROSITA all agree to within a confidence level of about 10\% with those we determined using {\textless}i{\textgreater}XMM-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data, and they are also consistent with the profiles published previously by the X-COP project. The cluster morphology and surface brightness profile of cluster Abell 3158 appear to be regular at a first glance. Clusters that have such profiles typically are relaxed and host cool cores. However, the temperature profile and map show that the cluster lacks a cool core, as was noted before. Instead, an off-centre cool clump lies to the west of the central cluster region, as reported previously. These are indications that the cluster may be undergoing some sloshing and merger activity. Furthermore, there is a bow-shaped edge near the location of the cool gas clump west of the cluster centre. Farther out west of the X-ray images of A3158, an extension of gas is detected. This larger-scale extension is described here for the first time. The gas metallicity ({\textasciitilde}0.2 solar) measured in the outskirts (»{\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) is consistent with an early-enrichment scenario. The velocity dispersion of the cluster member galaxies is measured to be 1058 ± 41 kms{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} based on spectroscopic redshifts of 365 cluster member galaxies and the total mass is determined as {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}200,{\textless}i{\textgreater}c{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 1.38 ± 0.25 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}15{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. The mass estimate based on the X-ray temperature is significantly lower at {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}200{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 6.20 ± 0.75 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, providing further indications that merger activity boosts the velocity dispersion and/or biases the temperature low. An extended X-ray source located south of the field of view also coincides with a galaxy overdensity with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.05 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.07. This source further supports the idea that the cluster is undergoing merger activity. Another extended source located north of the field of view is detected in X-rays and coincides with an overdensity of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range of 0.070 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.077. This is likely a background cluster that is not directly related to A3158. Additionally, the known South Pole Telescope cluster SPT-CL J0342-5354 at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0. 53 was detected.},

	abstract = {While awaiting direct velocity measurement of gas motions in the hot intracluster medium, we rely on indirect probes, including gas perturbations in galaxy clusters. Using a sample of \${\textbackslash}sim 80\$ clusters in different dynamic states from Omega500 cosmological simulations, we examine scaling relations between the fluctuation amplitudes of gas density, \${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho\$, pressure, \${\textbackslash}delta P/P\$, X-ray surface brightness, Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) y-parameter, and the characteristic Mach number of gas motions, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 1d\}\$. In relaxed clusters, accounting for halo ellipticities reduces \${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho\$ or \${\textbackslash}delta P/P\$ by a factor of up to 2 within \$r\_\{500c\}\$. We confirm a strong linear correlation between \${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho\$ (or \${\textbackslash}delta P/P\$) and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 1d\}\$ in relaxed clusters, with the proportionality coefficient \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}approx 1\$. For unrelaxed clusters, the correlation is less strong and has a larger \${\textbackslash}eta{\textbackslash}approx 1.3{\textbackslash}pm 0.5\$ (\$1.5{\textbackslash}pm0.5\$) for \${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho\$ (\${\textbackslash}delta P/P\$). Examination of the power-law scaling of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 1d\}\$ with \${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho\$ shows that it is almost linear for relaxed clusters, while for the unrelaxed ones, it is closer to \${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho{\textbackslash}propto M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 1d\}{\textasciicircum}2\$, supporting an increasing role of non-linear terms and compressive modes. In agreement with previous studies, we observe a strong correlation of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 1d\}\$ with radius. Correcting for these correlations leaves a residual scatter in \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 1d\}\$ of \${\textbackslash}sim 4 (7)\$ per cent for relaxed (perturbed) clusters. Hydrostatic mass bias correlates with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 1d\}\$ as strongly as with \${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho\$ in relaxed clusters. The residual scatters after correcting for derived trends is \${\textbackslash}sim 6-7\$ per cent. These predictions can be verified with existing X-ray and SZ observations of galaxy clusters combined with forthcoming velocity measurements with X-ray microcalorimeters.},

	abstract = {The diffuse hot medium inside clusters of galaxies typically exhibits turbulent motions whose amplitude increases with radius, as revealed by cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. However, its physical origin remains unclear. It could either be due to an excess injection of turbulence at large radii, or faster turbulence dissipation at small radii. We investigate this by studying the time evolution of turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM) after major mergers, using the Omega500 non-radiative hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. By applying a novel wavelet analysis to study the radial dependence of the ICM turbulence spectrum, we discover that faster turbulence dissipation in the inner high density regions leads to the increasing turbulence amplitude with radius. We also find that the ICM turbulence at all radii decays in two phases after a major merger: an early fast decay phase followed by a slow secular decay phase. The buoyancy effects resulting from the ICM density stratification becomes increasingly important during turbulence decay, as revealed by a decreasing turbulence Froude number \$Fr {\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(1)\$. Our results indicate that the stronger density stratification and smaller eddy turn-over time are the likely causes of the faster turbulence dissipation rate in the inner regions of the cluster.},

A thorough understanding of turbulence in the intracluster medium is crucial for the use of clusters to determine cosmological parameters. Moreover, clusters provide a unique laboratory to study a very unique and extreme plasma. Both, the observational evidence as well as results from (magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations are reviewed. In particular, we assess the roles of various drivers of turbulence: accretion and merging, active galactic nuclei, the motion of galaxies and conductive instabilities. It has been shown that the turbulence driven by accretion in galaxy clusters is mostly tangential in the inner regions and isotropic in regions close to the virial radius, while AGN drive mostly radial turbulent motions at close to sonic speeds. On the cluster scale, the energetically dominant mechanism for driving turbulence are major cluster mergers. In this chapter, we will focus on turbulent motions on the large scales—the properties of microphysical turbulence are reviewed elsewhere in this book (see the chapter by Brunetti and Jones).},

	abstract = {The footprint of LoTSS-DR2 covers 309 PSZ2 galaxy clusters, 83 of which host a radio halo and 26 host a radio relic(s). It provides us an excellent opportunity to statistically study the properties of extended cluster radio sources, especially their connection with merging activities. We aim to quantify cluster dynamic states to investigate their relation with the occurrence of extended radio sources. We also search for connections between intracluster medium (ICM) turbulence and nonthermal characteristics of radio halos in the LoTSS-DR2. We analyzed XMM-Newton and Chandra archival X-ray data and computed concentration parameters and centroid shifts that indicate the dynamic states of the clusters. We also performed a power spectral analysis of the X-ray surface brightness (SB) fluctuations to investigate large-scale density perturbations and estimate the turbulent velocity dispersion. The power spectral analysis results in a large scatter density fluctuation amplitude. We therefore only found a marginal anticorrelation between density fluctuations and cluster relaxation state, and we did not find a correlation between density fluctuations and radio halo power. Nevertheless, the injected power for particle acceleration calculated from turbulent dissipation is correlated with the radio halo power, where the best-fit unity slope supports the turbulent (re)acceleration scenario. Two different acceleration models, transit-time damping and adiabatic stochastic acceleration, cannot be distinguished due to the large scatter of the estimated turbulent Mach number. We introduced a new quantity \$[kT{\textbackslash}cdot Y\_X]\_\{r\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{RH\}\}\$, which is proportional to the turbulent acceleration power assuming a constant Mach number. This quantity is strongly correlated with radio halo power, where the slope is also unity.},

We also investigate how the latter affects the thermal and non-thermal properties of the intracluster medium, with differences discernible up to \${\textbackslash}sim\$ Gyr after the start of the jet. We evolved the energy spectra of cosmic-ray electrons, subject to energy losses that are dominated by synchrotron and inverse Compton emission as well as energy gains via re-acceleration by shock waves and turbulence. We find that in the absence of major mergers the amount of re-acceleration experienced by cosmic-ray electrons is not enough to produce long-lived detectable radio emissions. However, for all simulations the role of re-acceleration processes is crucial to maintain a significant and volume-filling reservoir of fossil electrons (\${\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}3\$) for several Gyrs after the first injection by jets. This is important to possibly explain recent discoveries of cluster-wide emission and other radio phenomena in galaxy clusters.},

	abstract = {In previous works, the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 3158 was reported to possess a relatively regular, relaxed morphology in the X-ray band. By analysing the Chandra and XMM–Newton archived data of Abell 3158, we have identified a bow-edge-shaped discontinuity in the X-ray surface brightness distribution about 120 h−171 kpc west of the X-ray peak. This feature is found to be associated with a massive, off-centre cool gas clump, and actually forms the west boundary of the cool clump. By calculating the thermal gas pressures in the cool clump and in the free-stream region, we determine that the cool gas clump is moving at a subsonic velocity of 700+140−340 km s−1 (M= 0.6+0.1−0.3) towards west on the sky plane. We exclude the possibility that this cool clump was formed by local inhomogeneous radiative cooling in the intracluster medium, because of the effectiveness of the thermal conduction on the time-scale of ∼0.3 Gyr. As no evidence for central active galactic nucleus activity has been found in Abell 3158, and this cool clump bears many similarities to the off-centre cool gas clumps detected in other merging clusters in terms of their mass, size, location and thermal properties (e.g. lower temperature and higher abundance as compared with the environment), we speculate that the cool clump in Abell 3158 was caused by a merger event, and is the remnant of the original central cool-core of the main cluster or the infalling subcluster. This idea is supported not only by the study of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of the cluster member galaxies, but also by the study of the gas entropy–temperature correlation. This example shows that the appearance of such massive, off-centre cool gas clumps can be used to diagnose the dynamical state of a cluster, especially when prominent shocks and cold fronts are absent.},

We identify a sharp edge in the radial X-ray surface brightness of the main cluster, which we find to be a cold front, with a jump in temperature of a factor of ∼3. This edge possesses a spiral morphology characteristic of core gas sloshing around the cluster potential minimum. We present observational evidence, supported by hydrodynamic simulations, that the northern sub-cluster is the object that initiated the core gas sloshing in the main cluster at least 700 Myr ago. We discuss reheating of the main cluster's core gas via two mechanisms brought about by the sloshing gas: first, the release of gravitational potential energy gained by the core's displacement from the potential minimum, and second, a dredging inward of the outer, higher entropy cluster gas along finger-shaped streams. We find that the available gravitational potential energy is small compared to the energy released by the cooling gas in the core.},

	abstract = {Non-thermal pressure in galaxy clusters leads to underestimation of the mass of galaxy clusters based on hydrostatic equilibrium with thermal gas pressure. This occurs even for dynamically relaxed clusters that are used for calibrating the mass-observable scaling relations. We show that the analytical model for non-thermal pressure developed in Shi \&amp; Komatsu can correct for this so-called ‘hydrostatic mass bias’, if most of the non-thermal pressure comes from bulk and turbulent motions of gas in the intracluster medium. Our correction works for the sample average irrespective of the mass estimation method, or the dynamical state of the clusters. This makes it possible to correct for the bias in the hydrostatic mass estimates from X-ray surface brightness and the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich observations that will be available for clusters in a wide range of redshifts and dynamical states.},

We report the discovery of a new cold front, the most distant one ever detected in a galaxy cluster, at about 1 Mpc from the center to the SE. Residual images, thermodynamics, and metal abundance maps qualitatively agree with predictions from numerical simulations of the sloshing phenomenon. However, the scales involved are much larger, similar to what has been recently observed in the Perseus cluster. These results show that sloshing is a cluster-wide phenomenon and is not confined in the cores. Sloshing extends well beyond the cooling region, involving a high fraction of the ICM up to almost half of the virial radius. The absence of a cool core and a newly discovered giant radio halo in A2142, in spite of its relaxed X-ray morphology, suggest that large scale sloshing, or the intermediate merger that caused it, may trigger Mpc-scale radio emission and may lead to the disruption of the cluster cool core.},

Many of these structures have similar morphologies, which exhibit spiral-like substructure. Aims. It is not yet well known how these structures are formed or maintained. Understanding the origin of these spiral-like features at the centre of some clusters is the major motivation behind this work. Methods. We analyse deep Chandra observations of 15 nearby galaxy clusters (0.01 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.06), and use X-ray temperature and substructure maps to detect small features at the cores of the clusters. Results. We detect spiral-like features at the centre of 7 clusters: A85, A426, A496, Hydra A cluster, Centaurus, Ophiuchus, and A4059. These patterns are similar to those found in numerical hydrodynamic simulations of cluster mergers with non-zero impact parameter. In some clusters of our sample, a strong radio source also occupies the inner region of the cluster, which indicates a possible connection between the two. Our investigation implies that these spiral-like structures may be caused by oﬀ-axis minor mergers. Since these features occur in regions of high density, they may conﬁne radio emission from the central galaxy producing, in some cases, unusual radio morphology.},

	abstract = {Recent X-ray observations of galaxy clusters have shown that there is substructure present in the intracluster medium (ICM), even in clusters that are seemingly relaxed. This substructure is sometimes a result of sloshing of the ICM, which occurs in cool core clusters that have been disturbed by an off-axis merger with a sub-cluster or group. We present deep Chandra observations of the cool core cluster Abell 2029, which has a sloshing spiral extending radially outward from the center of the cluster to approximately 400 kpc at its fullest extent—the largest continuous spiral observed to date. We ﬁnd a surface brightness excess, a temperature decrement, a density enhancement, an elemental abundance enhancement, and a smooth pressure proﬁle in the area of the spiral. The sloshing gas seems to be interacting with the southern lobe of the central radio galaxy, causing it to bend and giving the radio source a wide-angle tail (WAT) morphology. This shows that WATs can be produced in clusters that are relatively relaxed on large scales. We explore the interaction between heating and cooling in the central region of the cluster. Energy injection from the active galactic nucleus is likely insufﬁcient to offset the cooling, and sloshing may be an important additional mechanism in preventing large amounts of gas from cooling to very low temperatures.},

This new capability is expected to bring significant progress in understanding the dynamics, and therefore the physics, of the intracluster medium. However, because this plasma is optically thin, projection effects will be an important complicating factor in interpreting future Astro-H measurements. To study these effects in detail, we performed an analysis of the velocity field from simulations of a galaxy cluster experiencing gas sloshing and generated synthetic X-ray spectra, convolved with model Astro-H Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) responses. We find that the sloshing motions produce velocity signatures that will be observable by Astro-H in nearby clusters: the shifting of the line centroid produced by the fast-moving cold gas underneath the front surface, and line broadening produced by the smooth variation of this motion along the line of sight. The line shapes arising from inviscid or strongly viscous simulations are very similar, indicating that placing constraints on the gas viscosity from these measurements will be difficult. Our spectroscopic analysis demonstrates that, for adequate exposures, Astro-H will be able to recover the first two moments of the velocity distribution of these motions accurately, and in some cases multiple velocity components may be discerned. The simulations also confirm the importance of accurate treatment of point-spread function scattering in the interpretation of Astro-H/SXS spectra of cluster plasmas.},

	abstract = {(abridged) We perform hydrodynamical simulations of minor-merger induced gas sloshing and the subsequent formation of cold fronts in the Virgo cluster. We show for the first time that sloshing reproduces all characteristics of the observed cold fronts quantitatively, and we suggest a third cold front at 20 kpc NW of the Virgo core. We identify several new features typical for sloshing cold fronts, most importantly a large-scale brightness asymmetry. We can trace these new features not only in Virgo, but also in other sloshing cold front clusters. By comparing synthetic and real observations, we estimate that the original minor merger event took place about 1.5 Gyr ago when a subcluster of 2-4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}13 M{\textbackslash}odot passed the Virgo core at 100 to 400 kpc distance, where a smaller mass corresponds to a smaller pericentre distance, and vice versa. From the merger geometry, we derive the current location of the disturbing subcluster to be about 1-2 Mpc E of the Virgo core. A possible candidate is M60. Additionally, we quantify the metal redistribution by sloshing and discuss its importance. We verify that the subcluster required to produce the observed cold fronts could be completely ram pressure stripped before reaching the Virgo centre, and discuss the conditions required for this to be achieved. Finally, we demonstrate that the bow shock of a fast galaxy passing the Virgo cluster at {\textasciitilde} 400 kpc distance also causes sloshing and leads to very similar cold front structures. The responsible galaxy would be located about 2 Mpc north of the Virgo centre. A possible candidate is M85.},

	abstract = {To search for bulk motions of the intracluster medium, we analyzed X-ray spectra taken with the Suzaku satellite, and measured the Doppler shift of the Fe-K line emission from eight nearby clusters of galaxies with various X-ray morphologies. In the cores of the Centaurus and Perseus clusters, the gas bulk velocity does not exceed the sound velocity, which confirms the results of previous researchs. For the Cen 45 subcluster, we found that the radial velocity relative to the Centaurus core, \&lt;780 km s−1, is significantly smaller than that reported in the optical band at the 3.9 σ level, which suggests an offset between the gas and galaxy distributions along the line of sight due to the subcluster merger. In A 2199, A 2142, A 3667, and A 133, no significant bulk motion was detected, indicating an upper limit on the radial velocity of 3000–4000 km s−1. A sign of large bulk velocity in excess of the instrumental calibration uncertainty was found near the center of the cool-core cluster A 2029 and in a subcluster of the merging cluster A 2255, suggesting that the nonthermal pressure support is not negligible in estimating the total gravitational mass of not only merging clusters, but also relaxed clusters, as predicted by numerical simulations. To improve the significance of the detection, however, a further examination by follow-up observations is required. The present study provides a pilot survey prior to future high-resolution spectroscopy with ASTRO-H, which is expected to play a critical role in revealing the dynamical evolutions of clusters.},

Here we re-examine the case for galaxy clusters, often ignored due to substantial diffuse radio backgrounds, by considering the extrapolation of known cluster surface brightness profiles down to scales observable with MeerKAT. Despite large baryonic backgrounds, we find that clusters can be competitive with dwarf galaxies. Extrapolated Coma data being able to rule out WIMPs of mass \${\textless} 700\$ GeV annihilating via \$b\$-quarks. This is while having lesser uncertainties surrounding the magnetic field and diffusive environment.

Based on the ERO data from JWST, several groups have reported the results on strong lensing analysis and mass distribution of this cluster. However, limited by the angular coverage of the JWST data, the strong lensing models only cover the central region. X-ray analysis on the hot ICM is necessary to obtain a more complete constraint on the mass distribution in this very massive cluster. In this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive X-ray analysis of J0723 to obtain accurate ICM hydrostatic mass measurements, using the X-ray data from SRG/eROSITA and Chandra X-ray observatories. By comparing the hydrostatic mass profile with the strong lensing model, we aim to provide the most reliable constraint on the distribution of mass up to R500. Thanks to the eROSITA all-sky survey and Chandra data, which provide high S/N and high angular resolution respectively, we are able to constrain the ICM gas density profile and temperature profile with good accuracy both in the core and to the outskirts. With the density and temperature profiles, we compute the hydrostatic mass profile, which is then projected along the line of sight to compare with the mass distribution obtained from the recent strong lensing analysis based on JWST data. We also deproject the strong lensing mass distribution using the hydrostatic mass profile we obtained in this work. The X-ray results obtained from eROSITA and Chandra agree very well with each other. The hydrostatic mass profiles we measured in this work, both projected and deprojected, are in good agreement with recent strong lensing results based on JWST data, at all radii.},

We explore the effects of merging on the thermodynamic structure of the intracluster gas of the final merger remnant. In particular, we study how core entropy is generated during the merging and the stability properties of the initial cool-core profile against disruption. To this end, we consider a range of initial mass ratio and impact parameters. Final entropy profiles of our adiabatic merging simulations are in good accord with previous findings, with cool-cores being disrupted for all of the initial merging setups. For equal-mass off-axis mergers, we find that a significant contribution to the final primary core entropy is due to hydrodynamic instabilities generated by rotational motions, which are induced by tidal torques during the first pericentre passage. In radiative simulations, cool-cores are more resilient against heating processes; none the less, they are able to maintain their integrity only in the case of off-axis mergers with very unequal masses. We suggest that these results are robust against changes in the gas physical modelling, in particular to the inclusion of AGN thermal feedback.},

The numerical hydrodynamical scheme employs an SPH formulation in which gradient errors are strongly reduced by using an integral approach. We consider both adiabatic and radiative simulations. We construct cluster subsamples according to the cluster dynamical status or gas physical modeling, from which we extract small-scale turbulent velocities obtained by applying different multiscale filtering methods to cluster velocities. The velocity power spectra of nonradiative relaxed clusters are mostly solenoidal and exhibit a peak at wavenumbers set by injection scales ≃r200/10; at higher wavenumbers, the spectra are steeper than Kolmogorov. Cooling runs are distinguished by much shallower spectra, a feature which we interpret as the injection of turbulence at small scales due to the interaction of compact cool gas cores with the ICM. Turbulence in galaxy clusters is then characterized by multiple injection scales, with the small-scale driving source acting in addition to the large-scale injection mechanisms. Cooling runs of relaxed clusters exhibit enstrophy profiles with a power-law behavior over more than two decades in radius and a turbulent-to-thermal energy ratio ≲1\%. In accordance with Hitomi observations, in the core of a highly relaxed cluster, we find a low level of gas motions. In addition, the estimated cluster radial profile of the sloshing oscillation period is in very good agreement with recent Fornax measurements, with the associated Froude number satisfying Fr ≲ 0.1 within r/r200 ≲ 0.1. Our findings suggest that in cluster cores, ICM turbulence approaches a stratified anisotropic regime, with weak stirring motions dominated by gravity buoyancy forces and strongly suppressed along the radial direction. We conclude that turbulent heating cannot be considered the main heating source in cluster cores.},

	abstract = {X-ray observations of many clusters of galaxies reveal the presence of edges in surface brightness and temperature, known as “cold fronts.” In relaxed clusters with cool cores, these edges have been interpreted as evidence for the “sloshing” of the core gas in the cluster's gravitational potential. The smoothness of these edges has been interpreted as evidence for the stabilizing effect of magnetic fields “draped” around the front surfaces. To check this hypothesis, we perform high-resolution magnetohydrodynamics simulations of magnetized gas sloshing in galaxy clusters initiated by encounters with subclusters. We go beyond previous works on the simulation of cold fronts in a magnetized intracluster medium by simulating their formation in realistic, idealized mergers with high resolution (Δx ∼ 2 kpc). Our simulations sample a parameter space of plausible initial magnetic field strengths and field configurations. In the simulations, we observe strong velocity shears associated with the cold fronts amplifying the magnetic field along the cold front surfaces, increasing the magnetic field strength in these layers by up to an order of magnitude, and boosting the magnetic pressure up to near-equipartition with thermal pressure in some cases. In these layers, the magnetic field becomes strong enough to stabilize the cold fronts against Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities, resulting in sharp, smooth fronts as those seen in observations of real clusters. These magnetic fields also result in strong suppression of mixing of high- and low-entropy gases in the cluster, seen in our simulations of mergers in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, the heating of the core due to sloshing is very modest and is unable to stave off a cooling catastrophe.},

In this work we investigate different modes of AGN feedback and their effect on the surrounding medium by probing the diffuse X-ray emission from the hot gas inside galaxy groups and clusters. For this purpose, we use the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation SIMBA to theoretically calculate the X-ray emission from simulated galaxy clusters/groups with the help of the Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code (APEC). We also perform synthetic observations of these systems with the Chandra X-ray telescope using the ray-tracing simulator Model of AXAF Response to X-rays (MARX). Our results show that in addition to the radiative wind mode of feedback from the AGN, jet and X-ray mode of feedback play significant roles in suppressing the X-ray emission from the diffuse gas in the vicinity of the black hole. Our mock observational maps suggest that the signatures of AGN feedback from the high redshift objects may not be detected with the instrumental resolution of current X-ray telescopes like Chandra, but provide promising prospect for detection of these features with potential X-ray missions such as Lynx.},

By calculating the mass of all of the clusters using different permutations of the pressure, temperature, and density proﬁles, created with either the true simulated data or mock spectroscopic data, we ﬁnd that the spectroscopic temperature causes a bias in the hydrostatic mass estimates that increases with the mass of the cluster, regardless of the SPH ﬂavour used. For the most massive clusters, the estimated mass of the cluster using spectroscopic density and temperature proﬁles is found to be as low as 50 per cent of the true mass compared to ∼90 per cent for low-mass clusters. When including a correction for non-thermal pressure, the spectroscopic hydrostatic mass estimates are less biased on average and the mass dependence of the bias is reduced, although the scatter in the measurements does increase.},

	abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are useful tools to constrain cosmological parameters, only if their masses can be correctly inferred from observations. In particular, X-ray and Sunyaev–Zeldovich (SZ) effect observations can be used to derive masses within the framework of the hydrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, it is crucial to have a good control of the possible mass biases that can be introduced when this hypothesis is not valid. In this work, we analysed a set of 260 synthetic clusters from the MUSIC simulation project at redshifts 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.82. We estimate the hydrostatic mass of the MUSIC clusters from X-ray only (temperature and density) and from X-ray and SZ (density and pressure). Then, we compare them with the true 3D dynamical mass. The biases are of the order of 20 per cent. We ﬁnd that using the temperature instead of the pressure leads to a smaller bias, although the two values are compatible within 1σ . Non-thermal contributions to the total pressure support, arising from bulk motion and turbulence of the gas, are also computed and show that they are sufﬁcient to account for this bias. We also present a study of the correlation between the mass bias and the dynamical state of the clusters. A clear correlation is shown between the relaxation state of the clusters and the bias factor. We applied the same analysis on a subsample of 32 objects, already selected for supporting the NIKA2 SZ Large Program.},

	abstract = {Accurate and precise measurement of the masses of galaxy clusters is key to deriving robust constraints on cosmological parameters. However, increasing evidence from observations confirms that X-ray masses obtained under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium might be underestimated, as previously predicted by cosmological simulations. We analyze more than 300 simulated massive clusters from the Three Hundred Project, and investigate the connection between mass bias and several diagnostics extracted from synthetic X-ray images of these simulated clusters. We find that the azimuthal scatter measured in 12 sectors of the X-ray flux maps is a statistically significant indication of the presence of an intrinsic (i.e., 3D) clumpy gas distribution. We verify that a robust correction to the hydrostatic mass bias can be inferred when estimates of the gas inhomogeneity from X-ray maps (such as the azimuthal scatter or the gas ellipticity) are combined with the asymptotic external slope of the gas density or pressure profiles, which can be respectively derived from X-ray and millimeter (Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) observations. We also obtain that mass measurements based on either gas density and temperature or gas density and pressure result in similar distributions of the mass bias. In both cases, we provide corrections that help reduce both the dispersion and skewness of the mass bias distribution. These are effective even when irregular clusters are included leading to interesting implications for the modeling and correction of hydrostatic mass bias in cosmological analyses of current and future X-ray and SZ cluster surveys.},

Surface brightness fluctuations of the ICM also suggest that its turbulence is subsonic with a Kolmogorov scaling relation, indicating that the viscosity is suppressed and the kinetic energy cascades to small scales unscathed. However, recent observations of the cold gas filaments in galaxy clusters find that the scaling relations are steeper than that of the hot plasma, signaling kinetic energy losses and the presence of supersonic flows. In this work we use high-resolution simulations to explore the turbulent velocity structure of the cold filaments at the cores of galaxy clusters. Our results indicate that supersonic turbulent structures can be “frozen” in the cold gas that cools and fragments out of a fast, ∼107 K outflow driven by the central active galactic nucleus (AGN), when the radiative cooling time is shorter than the dynamical sound-crossing time. After the cold gas formation, however, the slope of the velocity structure function (VSF) flattens significantly over short, ∼10 Myr timescales. The lack of flattened VSF in observations of Hα filaments indicates that the Hα-emitting phase is short-lived for the cold gas in galaxy clusters. On the other hand, the ubiquity of supersonic turbulence revealed by observed filaments strongly suggests that supersonic outflows are an integral part of AGN–ICM interaction, and that AGN activity plays a crucial role at driving turbulence in galaxy clusters.},

	abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) play a central role in solving the decades-old cooling-flow problem. Although there is consensus that AGNs provide the energy to prevent catastrophically large star formation, one major problem remains: How is the AGN energy thermalized in the intracluster medium (ICM)? We perform a suite of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core cluster including cosmic rays (CRs). CRs are supplied to the ICM via collimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via streaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming instability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient at least within the context of the physical model considered here. When streaming is included, (i) CRs come into contact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, (ii) streaming instability heating dominates over Coulomb and hadronic heating, (iii) the AGN is variable and the atmosphere goes through low-/high-velocity dispersion cycles, and, importantly, (iv) CR pressure support in the cool core is very low and does not demonstrably violate observational constraints. However, when streaming is ignored, CR energy is not efficiently spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to a significant level, creating tension with the observations. Overall, we demonstrate that CR heating is a viable channel for the AGN energy thermalization in clusters and likely also in ellipticals, and that CRs play an important role in determining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool cores.},

In the case of a very inhomogeneous and asymmetric gas distribution, this method has been shown to return biased results in numerical simulations because of the n2 dependence of the X-ray emissivity. We propose a method to recover the true density proﬁles in the presence of inhomogeneities, based on the derivation of the azimuthal median of the surface brightness in concentric annuli. We demonstrate the performance of this method with numerical simulations, and apply it to a sample of 31 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.04–0.2 observed with ROSAT/Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC). The clumping factors recovered by comparing the mean and the median are mild and show√a slight trend of increasing bias with radius. For R {\textless} R500, we measure a clumping factor C {\textless} 1.1, which indicates that the thermodynamic properties and hydrostatic masses measured in this radial range are only mildly affected by this effect. Comparing our results with three sets of hydrodynamical numerical simulations, we found that non-radiative simulations signiﬁcantly overestimate the level of inhomogeneities in the intracluster medium, while the runs including cooling, star formation, and AGN feedback reproduce the observed trends closely. Our results indicate that most of the accretion of X-rayemitting gas is taking place in the diffuse, large-scale accretion patterns rather than in compact structures.},

	abstract = {Turbulence and conduction can dramatically aﬀect the evolution of baryons in the universe; current constraints are however rare and uncertain. Using 3D high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations, tracking both electrons and ions, we study the eﬀects of turbulence and conduction in the hot intracluster medium. We show how the power spectrum of the gas density perturbations (δ = δρ/ρ) can accurately constrain both processes. The characteristic amplitude of density perturbations is linearly related to the strength of turbulence, i.e. the 3D Mach number, as A(k)δ,max = c M, where c 0.25 for injection scale of 500 kpc. The slope of Aδ(k) in turn reﬂects the level of diﬀusion, dominated by conduction. In a non-conductive medium, subsonic stirring motions advect density with a similar nearly Kolmogorov cascade, Eδ(k) ∝ k−5/3. Increasing conduction (parametrized via the magnetic suppression f = 10−3 → 1) progressively steepens the spectrum towards the Burgers-like regime, Eδ(k) ∝ k−2. The slope is only weakly dependent on M. The turbulent Prandtl number deﬁnes the dynamic similarity of the ﬂow; at scales where Pt ≡ tcond/tturb {\textless} 100, the power spectrum develops a signiﬁcant decay, i.e. conduction stiﬂes turbulent regeneration. The transition is gentle for highly suppressed conduction, f ≤ 10−3, while sharp in the opposite regime. For strong conductivity ( f ≥ 0.1), Pt ∼ 100 occurs on spatial scales larger than the injection scale, globally damping density perturbations by a factor of 2−4, from large to small scales. The velocity spectrum is instead not much aﬀected by conduction. The f ≥ 0.1 regime should also aﬀect the appearance of X-ray images, in which Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor rolls and ﬁlaments are washed out. In a stratiﬁed system, perturbations are characterized by a mixture of modes: weak/strong turbulence induces higher isobaric/adiabatic ﬂuctuations, while conduction forces both modes towards the intermediate isothermal regime. We provide a general analytic ﬁt which is applied to new deep Chandra observations of Coma cluster. The observed spectrum is best consistent with strongly suppressed eﬀective isotropic conduction, f 10−3, and mild subsonic turbulence, M 0.45 (assuming injection scale at ∼250 kpc). The latter implies Eturb 0.11 Eth, in agreement with cosmological simulations and line-broadening observations. The low conductivity corroborates the survival of sharp features in the ICM (cold fronts, ﬁlaments, bubbles), and indicates that cooling ﬂows may not be balanced by conduction.},

Results. For individual clusters, we mapped the thermodynamic properties of the ICM and measured their spread in circular concentric annuli. Comparing the spread of diﬀerent gas quantities to high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we constrained the average Mach number regime of the sample to Mach1D ≈ 0.16 ± 0.07.

	abstract = {Mass estimates of galaxy clusters from X-ray and Sunyeav-Zel'dovich observations assume the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with their gravitational potential. However, since galaxy clusters are dynamically active objects whose dynamical states can deviate significantly from the equilibrium configuration, the departure from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption is one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainties in cluster cosmology. In the literature there have been two methods for computing the hydrostatic mass bias based on the Euler and the modified Jeans equations, respectively, and there has been some confusion about the validity of these two methods. The word "Jeans" was a misnomer, which incorrectly implies that the gas is collisionless. To avoid further confusion, we instead refer these methods as "summation" and "averaging" methods respectively. In this work, we show that these two methods for computing the hydrostatic mass bias are equivalent by demonstrating that the equation used in the second method can be derived from taking spatial averages of the Euler equation. Specifically, we identify the correspondences of individual terms in these two methods mathematically and show that these correspondences are valid to within a few percent level using hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy cluster formation. In addition, we compute the mass bias associated with the acceleration of gas and show that its contribution is small in the virialized regions in the interior of galaxy clusters, but becomes non-negligible in the outskirts of massive galaxy clusters. We discuss future prospects of understanding and characterizing biases in the mass estimate of galaxy clusters using both hydrodynamical simulations and observations and their implications for cluster cosmology.},

This, however, represents an extremely challenging inverse problem due to missing data and noise dominated measurements. In this work, we present a novel methodology for addressing such inverse problems by combining elements of Bayesian statistics, analytic physical theory, and a recent class of Deep Generative Models based on Neural Score Matching. This approach allows to do the following: (1) make full use of analytic cosmological theory to constrain the 2pt statistics of the solution, (2) learn from cosmological simulations any differences between this analytic prior and full simulations, and (3) obtain samples from the full Bayesian posterior of the problem for robust Uncertainty Quantification.

In this work we show that, after carefully disentangling bulk from small-scale turbulent motions in high-resolution simulations of galaxy clusters, we can constrain which fraction of the gas kinetic energy effectively provides pressure support in the cluster’s gravitational potential. While the ubiquitous presence of radial inﬂows in the cluster can lead to signiﬁcant bias in the estimate of the non-thermal pressure support, we report that only a part of this energy effectively acts as a source of pressure, providing a support of the order of ∼10 per cent of the total pressure at R200.},

	abstract = {We present radial entropy profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM) for a collection of 239 clusters taken from the Chandra X-ray Observatory's Data Archive. Entropy is of great interest because it controls ICM global properties and records the thermal history of a cluster. Entropy is therefore a useful quantity for studying the effects of feedback on the cluster environment and investigating any breakdown of cluster self-similarity. We find that most ICM entropy profiles are well fitted by a model which is a power law at large radii and approaches a constant value at small radii: K(r) = K 0 + K 100(r/100 kpc)α, where K 0 quantifies the typical excess of core entropy above the best-fitting power law found at larger radii. We also show that the K 0 distributions of both the full archival sample and the primary Highest X-Ray Flux Galaxy Cluster Sample of Reiprich (2001) are bimodal with a distinct gap between K 0 ≈ 30-50 keV cm2 and population peaks at K 0 {\textasciitilde} 15 keV cm2 and K 0 {\textasciitilde} 150 keV cm2. The effects of point-spread function smearing and angular resolution on best-fit K 0 values are investigated using mock Chandra observations and degraded entropy profiles, respectively. We find that neither of these effects is sufficient to explain the entropy-profile flattening we measure at small radii. The influence of profile curvature and number of radial bins on best-fit K 0 is also considered, and we find no indication that K 0 is significantly impacted by either. For completeness, we include previously unpublished optical spectroscopy of Hα and [N II] emission lines discussed in Cavagnolo et al. (2008a).

	abstract = {Substructures are known to be good tracers for the dynamical states and recent accretion histories of the most massive collapsed structures in the Universe, galaxy clusters. Observations find extremely massive substructures in some clusters, especially Abell 2744, which are potentially in tension with the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM paradigm since they are not found in simulations directly. However, the methods to measure substructure masses strongly differ between observations and simulations. Using the fully hydrodynamical cosmological simulation suite Magneticum Pathfinder we develop a method to measure substructure masses in projection from simulations, similar to the observational approach. We identify a simulated Abell 2744 counterpart that not only has eight substructures of similar mass fractions but also exhibits similar features in the hot gas component. This cluster formed only recently through a major merger together with at least 6 massive minor merger events since z=1, where prior the most massive component had a mass of less than \$1{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. We show that the mass fraction of all substructures and of the eighth substructure separately are excellent tracers for the dynamical state and assembly history for all galaxy cluster mass ranges, with high fractions indicating merger events within the last 2Gyr. Finally, we demonstrate that the differences between subhalo masses measured directly from simulations as bound and those measured in projection are due to methodology, with the latter generally 2-3 times larger than the former. We provide a predictor function to estimate projected substructure masses from SubFind masses for future comparison studies between simulations and observations.},

	abstract = {Galaxy clusters are useful laboratories to investigate the evolution of the Universe, and accurately measuring their total masses allows us to constrain important cosmological parameters. However, estimating mass from observations that use different methods and spectral bands introduces various systematic errors. This paper evaluates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to reliably and accurately infer the masses of galaxy clusters from the Compton-y parameter maps provided by the Planck satellite. The CNN is trained with mock images generated from hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters, with Planck's observational limitations taken into account. We observe that the CNN approach is not subject to the usual observational assumptions, and so is not affected by the same biases. By applying the trained CNNs to the real Planck maps, we find cluster masses compatible with Planck measurements within a 15\% bias. Finally, we show that this mass bias can be explained by the well known hydrostatic equilibrium assumption in Planck masses, and the different parameters in the Y500-M500 scaling laws. This work highlights that CNNs, supported by hydrodynamic simulations, are a promising and independent tool for estimating cluster masses with high accuracy, which can be extended to other surveys as well as to observations in other bands.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2209.09951},
	abstract = {Radio relics are Mpc-sized synchrotron sources located in the peripheral regions of galaxy clusters. Models based on the diffuse shock acceleration (DSA) scenario have been widely accepted to explain the formation of radio relics. However, a critical challenge to these models is that most observed shocks seem too weak to generate detectable emission, unless fossil electrons, a population of mildly energetic electrons that have been accelerated previously, are included in the models. To address this issue, we present a new semi-analytical model to describe the formation and evolution of radio relics by incorporating fossil relativistic electrons into DSA theory, which is constrained by a sample of 14 observed relics, and employ the Press-Schechter formalism to simulate the relics in a \$20{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\} {\textbackslash}times 20{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ sky field at 50, 158, and 1400 MHz, respectively. Results show that fossil electrons contribute significantly to the radio emission, which can generate radiation four orders of magnitude brighter than that solely produced by thermal electrons at 158 MHz, and the power distribution of our simulated radio relic catalog can reconcile the observed \$P\_\{1400\}-M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\}\$ relation. We predict that \$7.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ clusters with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\} {\textgreater} 1.2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ would host relics at 158 MHz, which is consistent with the result of \$10 {\textbackslash}pm 6{\textbackslash}\%\$ given by the LoTSS DR2. It is also found that radio relics are expected to cause severe foreground contamination in future EoR experiments, similar to that of radio halos. The possibility of AGN providing seed fossil relativistic electrons is evaluated by calculating the number of radio-loud AGNs that a shock is expected to encounter during its propagation.},

	abstract = {X-ray selected samples are known to miss galaxy clusters that are gas poor and have a low surface brightness. This is different for the optically selected samples such as the X-ray Unbiased Selected Sample (XUCS). We characterise the origin of galaxy clusters that are gas poor and have a low surface-brightness by studying covariances between various cluster properties at fixed mass using hydrodynamic cosmological simulations. We extracted approx. 1800 galaxy clusters from a high-resolution Magneticum hydrodynamic cosmological simulation and computed covariances at fixed mass of the following properties: core-excised X-ray luminosity, gas fraction, hot gas temperature, formation redshift, concentration, galaxy richness, fossilness parameter, and stellar mass of the bright central galaxy. We also compared the correlation between concentration and gas fractions in non-radiative simulations, and we followed the trajectories of particles inside galaxy clusters to assess the role of AGN depletion on the gas fraction. In simulations and in observational data, differences in surface brightness are related to differences in gas fraction. Simulations show that the gas fraction strongly correlates with assembly time, in the sense that older clusters are gas poor. Clusters that formed earlier have lower gas fractions because the feedback of the active galactic nucleus ejected a significant amount of gas from the halo. When the X-ray luminosity is corrected for the gas fraction, it shows little or no covariance with other quantities. Older galaxy clusters tend to be gas poor and possess a low X-ray surface brightness because the feedback mechanism removes a significant fraction of gas from these objects. Moreover, we found that most of the \$L\_X\$ covariance with the other quantities is explained by differences in the gas fraction.},

They are supplemented with available Chandra X-ray data, optical data taken by Hyper Suprime-Cam on Subaru, and millimeter-wave SZE data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Taking into account departures from spherical symmetry, we have reconstructed non-parametrically the inner pressure profile of two clusters as well as electron temperature and density profiles for RCS J2319+0038. This is one of the first such measurements for an individual cluster at \$z {\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.9\$. We find that the inner pressure profile of both clusters is much shallower than that of local cool-core clusters. Our results consistently suggest that RCS J2319+0038 hosts a weak cool core, where radiative cooling is less significant than in local cool cores. On the other hand, HSC J0947-0119 exhibits an even shallower pressure profile than RCS J2319+0038 and is more likely a non-cool-core cluster. The SZE centroid position is offset by more than 140 \$h\_\{70\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$kpc from the peaks of galaxy distribution in HSC J0947-0119, suggesting a stronger influence of mergers in this cluster. We conclude that these distant clusters are at a very early stage of developing the cool cores typically found in clusters at lower redshifts.},

The Richardson number is a parameter that represents the ratio between turbulence and buoyancy, and we found that this variable has a strong dependence on the filtering scale. However, we could not detect any strong relation between the Richardson number and the logarithmic density fluctuations, in contrast to results by recent and more idealised simulations. In particular, we find a strong effect from radial accretion, which appears to be the main driver for the gas fluctuations. The ubiquitous radial bias in the dynamics of the ICM suggests that homogeneity and isotropy are not always valid assumptions, even if the turbulent spectra follow Kolmogorov’s scaling. Finally, we find that the slope of the velocity and density spectra are independent of cluster-centric radii.},

	abstract = {The formation of astrophysical structures, such as stars, compact objects but also galaxies, entail an,enhancement of densities by many orders of magnitude which occurs through gravitational collapse. The role played by turbulence during this process is important. Turbulence generates density fluctuations, exerts a support against gravity and possibly delivers angular momentum. How turbulence exactly behave during the collapse and get amplified remains a matter of investigation. Spherical averaging of the fluid equations is carried out, leading to 1D fluid equations that describe the evolution of mean quantities in particular the mean radial velocity as well as the mean radial and transverse turbulent velocities. These equations differ from the ones usually employed in the literature. We then perform a series of 3D numerical simulations of collapsing clouds for a wide range of thermal and turbulent supports with two polytropic equation of state, \$P {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}rho{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}Gamma\$, with \${\textbackslash}Gamma=1\$ and 1.25. For each 3D simulations we perform a series of 1D simulations using the spherically averaged equations and with the same initial conditions. By performing a detailed comparison between 3D and 1D simulations, we can analyse in great details the observed behaviours. Altogether we find that the two approaches agree remarkably well demonstrating the validity of the inferred equations although when turbulence is initially strong, major deviations from spherical geometry certainly preclude quantitative comparisons. The detailed comparisons lead us to an estimate of the turbulent dissipation parameter that when the turbulence is initially low, is found to be in good agreement with previous estimate of non self-gravitating supersonic turbulence. abridged.},

	abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are powerful probes with which to study cosmology and astrophysics. However, for many applications an accurate measurement of a cluster's mass is essential. A systematic underestimate of hydrostatic masses from X-ray observations (the so-called hydrostatic bias) may be responsible for tension between the results of different cosmological measurements. We compare X-ray hydrostatic masses with masses estimated using the caustic method (based on galaxy velocities) in order to explore the systematic uncertainties of both methods and place new constraints on the level of hydrostatic bias. Hydrostatic and caustic mass profiles were determined independently for a sample of 44 clusters based on Chandra observations of clusters from the Hectospec Cluster Survey. This is the largest systematic comparison of its kind. Masses were compared at a standardised radius (\$R\_\{500\}\$) using a model that includes possible bias and scatter in both mass estimates. The systematics affecting both mass determination methods were explored in detail. The hydrostatic masses were found to be systematically higher than caustic masses on average, and we found evidence that the caustic method increasingly underestimates the mass when fewer galaxies are used to measure the caustics. We limit our analysis to the 14 clusters with the best-sampled caustics where this bias is minimised (\${\textbackslash}ge210\$ galaxies), and find that the average ratio of hydrostatic to caustic mass at \$R\_\{500\}\$ is \$M\_X/M\_C=1.12{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.10\}\$. We interpret this result as a constraint on the level of hydrostatic bias, favouring small or zero levels of hydrostatic bias (less than \$20{\textbackslash}\%\$ at the \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level). However, we find systematic uncertainties associated with both mass estimation methods remain at the \$10-15{\textbackslash}\%\$ level, which would permit significantly larger levels of hydrostatic bias.},

	abstract = {We study a merger of the NGC 4839 group with the Coma cluster using X-ray observations from the XMM–Newton and Chandra telescopes. X-ray data show two prominent features: (i) a long (∼600 kpc in projection) and bent tail of cool gas trailing (towards south-west) the optical centre of NGC 4839, and (ii) a ‘sheath’ region of enhanced X-ray surface brightness enveloping the group, which is due to hotter gas. While at first glance the X-ray images suggest that we are witnessing the first infall of NGC 4839 into the Coma cluster core, we argue that a post-merger scenario provides a better explanation of the observed features and illustrate this with a series of numerical simulations. In this scenario, the tail is formed when the group, initially moving to the south-west, reverses its radial velocity after crossing the apocenter, the ram pressure ceases and the ram pressure-displaced gas falls back towards the centre of the group and overshoots it. Shortly after the apocenter passage, the optical galaxy, dark matter, and gaseous core move in a north-east direction, while the displaced gas continues moving to the south-west. The ‘sheath’ is explained as being due to interaction of the re-infalling group with its own tail of stripped gas mixed with the Coma gas. In this scenario, the shock, driven by the group before reaching the apocenter, has already detached from the group and would be located close to the famous relic to the south-west of the Coma cluster.},

	abstract = {Clusters of galaxies can potentially produce cosmic rays (CRs) up to very-high energies via large-scale shocks and turbulent acceleration. Due to their unique magnetic-field configuration, CRs with energy \${\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{17\}\$ eV can be trapped within these structures over cosmological time scales, and generate secondary particles, including neutrinos and gamma rays, through interactions with the background gas and photons. In this work, we compute the contribution from clusters of galaxies to the diffuse neutrino background. We employ three-dimensional cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to model the turbulent intergalactic medium. We use the distribution of clusters within this cosmological volume to extract the properties of this population, including mass, magnetic field, temperature, and density. We propagate CRs into this environment using multi-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations across different redshifts (from \$z {\textbackslash}sim 5\$ to \$z =0\$), considering all relevant photohadronic, photonuclear, and hadronuclear interaction processes. For CRs injected with a power-law energy spectrum \${\textbackslash}propto E{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, we find that clusters contribute to the diffuse flux observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory with up to \${\textbackslash}sim 20 {\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}\%\$. On the other hand, for a CR spectrum \${\textbackslash}propto E{\textasciicircum}\{-1.5\}\$, our results are compatible with the observed flux of IceCube, though most of the contribution comes from clusters with \$M {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and redshift \$ z {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.3\$.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10402},
	abstract = {Observational astrophysics consists of making inferences about the Universe by comparing data and models. The credible intervals placed on model parameters are often as important as the maximum a posteriori probability values, as the intervals indicate concordance or discordance between models and with measurements from other data. Intermediate statistics (e.g. the power spectrum) are usually measured and inferences made by fitting models to these rather than the raw data, assuming that the likelihood for these statistics has multivariate Gaussian form. The covariance matrix used to calculate the likelihood is often estimated from simulations, such that it is itself a random variable. This is a standard problem in Bayesian statistics, which requires a prior to be placed on the true model parameters and covariance matrix, influencing the joint posterior distribution. As an alternative to the commonly-used Independence-Jeffreys prior, we introduce a prior that leads to a posterior that has approximately frequentist matching coverage. This is achieved by matching the covariance of the posterior to that of the distribution of true values of the parameters around the maximum likelihood values in repeated trials, under certain assumptions. Using this prior, credible intervals derived from a Bayesian analysis can be interpreted approximately as confidence intervals, containing the truth a certain proportion of the time for repeated trials. Linking frequentist and Bayesian approaches that have previously appeared in the astronomical literature, this offers a consistent and conservative approach for credible intervals quoted on model parameters for problems where the covariance matrix is itself an estimate.},

	abstract = {Turbulent dynamo theories have faced difficulties in obtaining evolution of large-scale magnetic fields on short dynamical time-scales due to the constraint imposed by magnetic helicity balance. This has critical implications for understanding the large-scale magnetic field evolution in astrophysical systems like the Sun, stars and galaxies. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) in the past with isotropically forced helical turbulence have shown that large-scale dynamo saturation time-scales are dependent on the magnetic Reynolds number (Rm). In this work, we have carried out periodic box DNS of helically forced turbulence leading to a large-scale dynamo with two kinds of forcing function, an isotropic one based on that used in PENCIL-CODE and an anisotropic one based on Galloway-Proctor flows. We show that when the turbulence is forced anisotropically, the nonlinear (saturation) behaviour of the large-scale dynamo is only weakly dependent on Rm. In fact the magnetic helicity evolution on small and large scales in the anisotropic case is distinctly different from that in the isotropic case. This result possibly holds promise for the alleviation of important issues like catastrophic quenching.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04686},
	abstract = {Matter distribution around clusters is highly anisotropic from their being the nodes of the cosmic web. Clusters' shape and the number of filaments they are connected to, i.e., their connectivity, should reflect their level of anisotropic matter distribution and must be, in principle, related to their physical properties. We investigate the influence of the dynamical state and the formation history on both the morphology and local connectivity of about 2400 groups and clusters of galaxies from the large hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG at z=0. We find that the mass of groups and clusters mainly influences the geometry of the matter distribution: massive halos are significantly more elliptical, and more connected to the cosmic web than low-mass ones. Beyond the mass-driven effect, ellipticity and connectivity are correlated and are imprints of the growth rate of groups and clusters. Both anisotropy measures appear to trace different dynamical states, such that unrelaxed groups and clusters are more elliptical and more connected than relaxed ones. This relation between matter anisotropies and dynamical state is the sign of different accretion histories. Relaxed groups and clusters are mostly formed long time ago, and slowly accreting matter at the present time. They are rather spherical and weakly connected to their environment, mostly because they had enough time to relax and, hence, lost the connection with their preferential directions of accretion and merging. In contrast, late-formed unrelaxed objects are highly anisotropic with large connectivities and ellipticities. These groups and clusters are in formation phase and must be strongly affected by the infalling of materials from filaments.},

	abstract = {Cosmological density fluctuations are often assumed to be Gaussian random fields. The local maxima of such fields are obvious sites for the formation of nonlinear structures. The statistical properties of the peaks can be used to predict the abundances and clustering properties of objects of various types. In this paper, we derive (1) the number density of peaks of various heights vcr0 above the rms {\textless}70; (2) the factor by which the peak density is enhanced in large-scale overdense regions; (3) the n-point peak-peak correlation function in the limit that the peaks are well separated, with special emphasis on the two- and three-point correlations; and (4) the density profiles centered on peaks. To illustrate the predictive power of this semianalytic approach, we apply our formulae to structure formation in the adiabatic and isocurvature Q = 1 cold dark matter (CDM) models. We assume bright galaxies form only at those peaks in the density field (smoothed on a galactic scale) that are above some global threshold height v, æ 3 fixed by normalizing to the galaxy number density. We find, for example, that the shapes of the peak-peak two- and three-point correlation functions for the adiabatic CDM model agree well with observations before any dynamical evolution, just due to the propensity of the peaks to be clustered in the initial conditions. Only moderate dynamical evolution is required to bring the amplitude of the correlations up to the observed level. The corresponding redshift of galaxy formation zg in the isocurvature model is too recent (zg æ 0) for this model to be viable. Even for the adiabatic models zg ä 3-4 is predicted. We show that the mass-per-peak ratio in clusters, and thus presumably the cluster mass-tolight ratio, is substantially lower than in the ambient medium, alleviating the Q problem. We also confirm that the smoothed density profiles of collapsing structures of height {\textasciitilde} vt are inherently triaxial.},

Part of the results presented here were achieved during a two-year observational program, the ITP, developed at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain). In the ITP we carried out a systematic optical follow-up campaign of all the 212 unidentified PSZ1 sources in the northern sky that have a declination above \$-15{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ and are without known counterparts at the time of the publication of the catalogue. We present for the first time the velocity dispersion and dynamical mass of 58 of these ITP PSZ1 clusters, plus 35 newly discovered clusters that are not associated with the PSZ1 catalogue. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) archival data, we extend this sample, including 212 already confirmed PSZ1 clusters in the northern sky. Using a subset of 207 of these galaxy clusters, we constrained the \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SZ\}\$--\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm dyn\}\$ scaling relation, finding a mass bias of \$(1-B) = 0.83{\textbackslash}pm0.07\$(stat)\${\textbackslash}pm0.02\$(sys). We show that this value is consistent with other results in the literature that were obtained with different methods (X-ray, dynamical masses, or weak-lensing mass proxies).

	abstract = {The central regions of cool-core galaxy clusters harbour multiphase gas with temperatures ranging from \$10{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$. Feedback from AGN jets prevents the gas from undergoing a catastrophic cooling flow. However, the exact mechanism of this feedback energy input is unknown, mainly due to the lack of velocity measurements of the hot phase gas, which has large thermal velocities. However, recent observations have measured the velocity structure functions (\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{VSF\}\$s) of the cooler phases (at \$10{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$) and used them to indirectly estimate the motions of the hot phase. In the first part of this study, we conduct high-resolution (\$384{\textasciicircum}3\$--\$1536{\textasciicircum}3\$ resolution elements) simulations of homogeneous isotropic subsonic turbulence, without radiative cooling. We analyse the second-order velocity structure functions (\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{VSF\}\_2\$) in these simulations and study the effects of varying spatial resolution, the introduction of magnetic fields and the effect of line of sight (LOS) projection on the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{VSF\}\_2\$. In the second part of the study, we analyse high-resolution (\$768{\textasciicircum}3\$ resolution elements) idealised simulations of multiphase turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM) from Mohapatra et al 2021. We compare \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{VSF\}\_2\$ for both the hot (\$T{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$) and cold (\$T{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$) phases. We also look for the effect of LOS projection. For turbulence without radiative cooling, we observe a steepening in the slopes of the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{VSF\}\_2\$ upon projection. In our runs with radiative cooling and multiphase gas, we find that the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{VSF\}\_2\$ of the hot and cold phases have similar scaling, but introducing magnetic fields steepens the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{VSF\}\_2\$ of the cold phase only. We also find that projection along the LOS steepens the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{VSF\}\_2\$ for the hot phase and mostly flattens it for the cold phase.},

	abstract = {We present an ensemble X-ray analysis of systematic perturbations in the central hot gas properties for a sample of 28 nearby strong cool-core systems selected from the HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample (HIFLUGCS). We analyze their cool-core features observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. All individual systems in our sample exhibit at least a pair of positive and negative excess perturbations in the X-ray residual image after subtracting the global brightness profile. We extract and analyze X-ray spectra of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the detected perturbed regions. To investigate possible origins of the gas perturbations, we characterize thermodynamic properties of the ICM in the perturbed regions and characterize their correlations between positive and negative excess regions. The best-fit relations for temperature and entropy show a clear offset from the one-to-one relation, \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{neg\}/T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pos\}=1.20{\textasciicircum}\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.03\}\$ and \$K\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{neg\}/K\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pos\}=1.43{\textbackslash}pm 0.07\$, whereas the best-fit relation for pressure is found to be remarkably consistent with the one-to-one relation \$P\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{neg\}=P\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pos\}\$, indicating that the ICM in the perturbed regions is in pressure equilibrium. These observed features in the HIFLUGCS sample are in agreement with the hypothesis that the gas perturbations in cool cores are generated by gas sloshing. We also analyze synthetic observations of perturbed cluster cores created from binary merger simulations, finding that the observed temperature ratio agrees with the simulations, \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{neg\}/T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pos\}{\textbackslash}sim 1.3\$. We conclude that gas sloshing induced by infalling substructures plays a major role in producing the characteristic gas perturbations in cool cores. The ubiquitous presence of gas perturbations in cool cores may suggest a significant contribution of gas sloshing to suppressing runaway cooling of the ICM.},

	abstract = {Methods. We investigated a novel approach to describe surface brightness proﬁles, where the excess cool-core emission in the centers of the galaxy clusters is modeled using wavelet decomposition. Morphological parameters and the residuals were compared to classical single β-models, ﬁtted to the overall surface brightness proﬁles.
Results. Using single β-models to describe the ensemble of overall surface brightness proﬁles leads on average to a non-zero bias (0.032 ± 0.003) in the outer part of the clusters, that is an approximate 3\% systematic diﬀerence in the surface brightness at large radii. Furthermore, β-models show a general trend toward underestimating the ﬂux in the outskirts for smaller core radii. Fixing the β parameter to 2/3 doubles the bias and increases the residuals from a single β-model up to more than 40\%. Modeling the core region in the ﬁtting procedure reduces the impact of these two eﬀects signiﬁcantly. In addition, we ﬁnd a positive scaling between shape parameters and temperature, as well as a negative correlation of approximately −0.4 between extent and luminosity.
Conclusion. We demonstrate the caveats in modeling galaxy clusters with single β-models and recommend using them with caution, especially when the systematics are not taken into account. Our non-parametric analysis of the self-similar scaled emission measure proﬁles indicates no systematic core-type diﬀerences of median proﬁles in the galaxy cluster outskirts.},

Our 90 GHz SZE data result in a sensitive, 34 μJy beam-1 map of the SZE at 13'' effective resolution using the MUSTANG bolometer array on the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Our 140 and 268 GHz SZE imaging, with resolutions of 58'' and 31'' and sensitivities of 1.8 and 3.3 mJy beam-1, respectively, was obtained through observations from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory using Bolocam. We compare these maps to a two-dimensional pressure map derived from Chandra X-ray observations. Our MUSTANG SZE data confirm previous indications from Chandra of a pressure enhancement due to shock-heated, {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 20 keV gas immediately adjacent to extended radio emission seen in low-frequency radio maps of this cluster. MUSTANG also detects pressure substructure that is not well constrained by the Chandra X-ray data in the remnant core of a merging subcluster. We find that the small-scale pressure enhancements in the MUSTANG data amount to {\textasciitilde}2\% of the total pressure measured in the 140 GHz Bolocam observations. The X-ray inferred pseudo-pressure template also fails on larger scales to accurately describe the Bolocam data, particularly at the location of the subcluster with a remnant core known to have a high line-of-sight optical velocity of {\textasciitilde}3200 km s-1. Our Bolocam data are adequately described when we add an additional component—not described by a thermal SZE spectrum—to the X-ray template coincident with this subcluster. Using flux densities extracted from our model fits, and marginalizing over the X-ray spectroscopic temperature constraints for the region, we fit a thermal + kinetic SZE spectrum to our Bolocam data and find that the subcluster has a best-fit line-of-sight proper velocity vz = 3600+3440 - 2160 km s-1, in agreement with the optical velocity estimates for the subcluster. The probability vz {\textless}= 0 given our measurements is 2.1\%. Repeating this analysis using flux densities measured directly from our maps results in a 3.4\% probability vz {\textless}= 0.

	abstract = {Measurement of the gas velocity distribution in galaxy clusters provides insight into the physics of mergers, through which large scale structures form in the Universe. Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be obtained via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but its observation is challenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic effects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report resolved observations, at 150 and 260 GHz, of the SZ effect toward the triple merger MACS J0717.5+3745 (z = 0.55), using data obtained with the NIKA camera at the IRAM 30 m telescope. Assuming that theSZ signal is the sum of a thermal (tSZ) and a kinetic (kSZ) component and by combining the two NIKA bands, we extract for the first time a resolved map of the kSZ signal in a cluster. The kSZ signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at -5.1 and + 3.4σ, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us and coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a major merging event. We model the gas electron density and line-of-sight velocity of MACS J0717.5+3745 as four subclusters. Combining NIKA data with X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra, we fit this model to constrain the gas line-of-sight velocity of each component, and we also derive, for the first time, a velocity map from kSZ data (i.e. that is model-dependent). Our results are consistent with previous constraints on the merger velocities, and thanks to the high angular resolution of our data, we are able to resolve the structure of the gas velocity. Finally, we investigate possible contamination and systematic effects with a special care given to radio and submillimeter galaxies. Among the sources that we detect with NIKA, we find one which is likely to be a high redshift lensed submillimeter galaxy.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations with varying realism indicate an emergent principle -- multiphase condensation and large cavity power occur when the ratio of the cooling time to the free-fall time (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$) falls below a threshold value close to 10. Observations indeed show cool-core signatures when this ratio falls below 20-30, but the prevalence of cores with {\textbackslash}tctf{\textasciitilde}ratio below 10 is rare as compared to simulations. In X-ray observations, we obtain projected spectra from which we have to infer radial gas density and temperature profiles. Using idealized models of X-ray cavities and multiphase gas in the core and 3-D hydro jet-ICM simulations, we quantify the biases introduced by deprojection based on the assumption of spherical symmetry in determining \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$. We show that while the used methods are able to recover the \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ ratio for relaxed clusters, they have an uncertainty of a factor of \$2-3\$ in systems containing large cavities (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 20\$ kpc). We also show that the mass estimates from these methods, in absence of X-ray spectra close to the virial radius, suffer from a degeneracy between the virial mass (\$M\_\{200\}\$) and the concentration parameter (\$c\$) in the form of \$M\_\{200\}{\textbackslash}: c{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}approx\$ constant. Additionally, lack of soft-X-ray (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.5\$ keV) coverage and poor spatial resolution make us overestimate min(\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$) by a factor of few in clusters with min(\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm cool\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$) \${\textbackslash}lesssim 5\$.

	abstract = {Major mergers between galaxy clusters can produce large turbulent and bulk flow velocities in the intra-cluster medium and thus imprint diagnostic features in X-ray spectral emission lines from heavy ions. As demonstrated by Hitomi in observations of the Perseus cluster, measurements of gas velocities in clusters from high-resolution X-ray spectra will be achievable with upcoming X-ray calorimeters like those on board XRISM, Athena, or a Lynx like mission. We investigate this possibility for interesting locations across a major cluster merger from a hydrodynamical simulation, via X-ray synthetic spectra with a few eV energy resolution. We observe the system from directions perpendicular to the plane of the merger and along the merger axis. In these extreme geometrical configurations, we find clear non-Gaussian shapes of the iron He-like K\_alpha line at 6.7keV. The velocity dispersion predicted from the simulations can be retrieved for the brightest 100ks pointings with XRISM Resolve, despite some discrepancy related to the complex non-Gaussian line shapes. Measurements in faint regions require however high S/N and the larger collecting area of the Athena X-IFU calorimeter is thus needed. With the latter, we also investigate the gas temperature and velocity gradient across the merger bow shock edge, from 20"-wide annuli extracted from a single 1Ms X-IFU pointing. We find best-fit temperature and velocity dispersion values that are consistent with predictions from the simulations within 1-sigma, but the uncertainties on the inferred velocity dispersion are too large to place any stringent constraints on the shallow gradient downstream of the shock. We also present simulated images of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, using the above viewing configurations, and compare the results at angular resolutions appropriate for future observatories such as CMB-S4 and AtLAST.},

	abstract = {Giant radio halos are megaparsec-scale diffuse radio sources associated with the central regions of galaxy clusters. The most promising scenario to explain the origin of these sources is that of turbulent re-acceleration, in which MeV electrons injected throughout the formation history of galaxy clusters are accelerated to higher energies by turbulent motions mostly induced by cluster mergers. In this Letter, we use the amplitude of density fluctuations in the intracluster medium as a proxy for the turbulent velocity and apply this technique to a sample of 51 clusters with available radio data. Our results indicate a segregation in the turbulent velocity of radio halo and radio quiet clusters, with the turbulent velocity of the former being on average higher by about a factor of two. The velocity dispersion recovered with this technique correlates with the measured radio power through the relation , which implies that the radio power is nearly proportional to the turbulent energy rate. In case turbulence cascades without being dissipated down to the particle acceleration scales, our results provide an observational confirmation of a key prediction of the turbulent re-acceleration model and possibly shed light on the origin of radio halos.},

	abstract = {Galaxy clusters are good targets for examining our understanding of cosmology. Apart from numerical simulations and gravitational lensing, X-ray observation is the most common and conventional way to analyze the gravitational structures of galaxy clusters. Therefore, it is valuable to have simple analytical relations that can connect the observed distribution of the hot, X-ray emitting gas to the structure of the dark matter in the clusters as derived from simulations. In this article, we apply a simple framework that can analytically connect the hot gas empirical parameters with the standard parameters in the cosmological cold dark matter model. We have theoretically derived two important analytic relations, \$r\_s {\textbackslash}approx {\textbackslash}sqrt\{3\}r\_c\$ and \${\textbackslash}rho\_s {\textbackslash}approx 9{\textbackslash}beta kT/8 {\textbackslash}pi Gm\_gr\_c{\textasciicircum}2\$, which can easily relate the dark matter properties in galaxy clusters with the hot gas properties. This can give a consistent picture describing gravitational astrophysics for galaxy clusters by the hot gas and cold dark matter models.},

Among them, the morphological analysis of cluster images is well suited for this purpose. We report a new approach to the morphology, which consists in analytically modelling the images with a set of orthogonal functions, the Zernike polynomials (ZPs). We validated the method on mock high-resolution Compton parameter maps of synthetic galaxy clusters from THE THREE HUNDRED project. To classify the maps for their morphology we defined a single parameter, \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$, by combining the contribution of some ZPs in the modelling. We verify that \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ is linearly correlated with a combination of common morphological parameters and also with a proper 3D dynamical-state indicator available for the synthetic clusters we used. We also show the early results of the Zernike modelling applied on Compton parameter maps of local clusters (\$z {\textless} 0.1\$) observed by the \${\textbackslash}textit\{Planck\}\$ satellite. At last, we report the preliminary results of this kind of morphological analysis on mock X-ray maps of THE THREE HUNDRED clusters.},

	abstract = {Massive galaxy clusters are filled with a hot, turbulent and magnetized intra-cluster medium. Still forming under the action of gravitational instability, they grow in mass by accretion of supersonic flows. These flows partially dissipate into heat through a complex network of large-scale shocks [1], while residual transonic flows create giant turbulent eddies and cascades [2,3]. Turbulence heats the intra-cluster medium [4] and also amplifies magnetic energy by way of dynamo action [5-8]. However, the pattern regulating the transformation of gravitational energy into kinetic, thermal, turbulent and magnetic energies remains unknown. Here we report that the energy components of the intra-cluster medium are ordered according to a permanent hierarchy, in which the ratio of thermal to turbulent to magnetic energy densities remains virtually unaltered throughout the cluster's history, despite evolution of each individual component and the drive towards equipartition of the turbulent dynamo. This result revolves around the approximately constant efficiency of turbulence generation from the gravitational energy that is freed during mass accretion, revealed by our computational model of cosmological structure formation [3,9]. The permanent character of this hierarchy reflects yet another type of self-similarity in cosmology [10-13], while its structure, consistent with current data [14-18], encodes information about the efficiency of turbulent heating and dynamo action.},

The gas sloshing triggered by the merger can reproduce almost all observed features, e.g. the characteristic spiral-like brightness residual distribution in the cluster centre and its asymmetry out to 500 kpc, also the positions of and contrasts across the cold fronts. If the subcluster passes close (100 kpc) to the cluster core, the resulting shear flows are strong enough to trigger Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities that in projection resemble the peculiar kinks in the cold fronts of Abell 496.

	abstract = {The "sloshing" of the cold gas in the cores of relaxed clusters of galaxies is a widespread phenomenon, evidenced by the presence of spiral-shaped "cold fronts" in X-ray observations of these systems. In simulations, these flows of cold gas readily form by interactions of the cluster core with small subclusters, due to a separation of the cold gas from the dark matter (DM), due to their markedly different collisionalities. In this work, we use numerical simulations to investigate the effects of increasing the DM collisionality on sloshing cold fronts in a cool-core cluster. For clusters in isolation, the formation of a flat DM core via self-interactions results in modest adiabatic expansion and cooling of the core gas. In merger simulations, cold fronts form in the same manner as in previous simulations, but the flattened potential in the core region enables the gas to expand to larger radii in the initial stages. Upon infall, the subcluster's DM mass decreases via collisions, reducing its influence on the core. Thus, the sloshing gas moves slower, inhibiting the growth of fluid instabilities relative to simulations where the DM cross section is zero. This also inhibits turbulent mixing and the increase in entropy that would otherwise result. For values of the cross section \${\textbackslash}sigma/m {\textgreater} 1\$, subclusters do not survive as self-gravitating structures for more than two core passages. Additionally, separations between the peaks in the X-ray emissivity and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect signals during sloshing may place constraints on DM self-interactions.},

This approximation is rather crude in hierarchical clustering scenarios where both smooth accretion and aggregation of smaller dark matter halos contribute to the mass accretion of clusters.Nevertheless, in the redshift range \$z=[0,2]\$, our prescription returns an average MAR within \$20-40 {\textbackslash}\%\$ of the average rate derived from the merger trees of dark matter halos extracted from \$N\$-body simulations. The MAR of galaxy clusters has been the topic of numerous detailed numerical and theoretical investigations, but so far it has remained inaccessible to measurements in the real universe. Since the measurement of the mass profile of clusters beyond their virial radius can be performed with the caustic technique applied to dense redshift surveys of the cluster outer regions, our result suggests that measuring the mean MAR of a sample of galaxy clusters is actually feasible. We thus provide a new potential observational test of the cosmological and structure formation models.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00019},
	abstract = {Turbulence driven by AGN activity, cluster mergers and galaxy motion constitutes an attractive energy source for heating the intracluster medium (ICM). How this energy dissipates into the ICM plasma remains unclear, given its low collisionality and high magnetization (precluding viscous heating by Coulomb processes). Kunz et al. 2011 proposed a viable heating mechanism based on the anisotropy of the plasma pressure (gyroviscous heating) under ICM conditions. The present paper builds upon that work and shows that particles can be gyroviscously heated by large-scale turbulent fluctuations via magnetic pumping. We study how the anisotropy evolves under a range of forcing frequencies, what waves and instabilities are generated and demonstrate that the particle distribution function acquires a high energy tail. For this, we perform particle-in-cell simulations where we periodically vary the mean magnetic field \${\textbackslash}textbf\{B\}(t)\$. When \${\textbackslash}textbf\{B\}(t)\$ grows (dwindles), a pressure anisotropy \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\}{\textgreater}P\_\{{\textbackslash}parallel\}\$ (\$P\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\}{\textless} P\_\{{\textbackslash}parallel\}\$) builds up (\$P\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\}\$ and \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}parallel\}\$ are, respectively, the pressures perpendicular and parallel to \${\textbackslash}textbf\{B\}(t)\$). These pressure anisotropies excite mirror (\$P\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\}{\textgreater}P\_\{{\textbackslash}parallel\}\$) and oblique firehose (\$P\_\{{\textbackslash}parallel\}{\textgreater}P\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\}\$) instabilities, which trap and scatter the particles, limiting the anisotropy and providing a channel to heat the plasma. The efficiency of this mechanism depends on the frequency of the large-scale turbulent fluctuations and the efficiency of the scattering the instabilities provide in their nonlinear stage. We provide a simplified analytical heating model that captures the phenomenology involved. Our results show that this process can be relevant in dissipating and distributing turbulent energy at kinetic scales in the ICM.},

	abstract = {We use SWIFT, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, to simulate the evolution of bubbles inflated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets, as well as their interactions with the ambient intracluster medium (ICM). These jets inflate lobes that turn into bubbles after the jets are turned off (at \$t=50\$ Myr). Almost all of the energy injected into the jets is transferred to the ICM very quickly after they are turned off, with roughly \$70\$ per cent of it in thermal form and the rest in kinetic. At late times (\$t{\textgreater}500\$ Myr) we find the following: 1) the bubbles draw out trailing filaments of low-entropy gas, similar to those recently observed, 2) the action of buoyancy and the uplift of the filaments dominates the energetics of both the bubbles and the ICM and 3) almost all of the originally injected energy is in the form of gravitational potential energy, with the bubbles containing \$15\$ per cent of it, and the rest contained in the ICM. These findings indicate that feedback proceeds mainly through the displacement of gas to larger radii. We find that the uplift of these filaments permanently changes the thermodynamic properties of the ICM by reducing the central density and increasing the central temperature (within \$30\$ kpc). We propose that jet feedback proceeds not only through the heating of the ICM (which can delay cooling), but also through the uplift-related reduction of the central gas density. The latter also delays cooling, on top of reducing the amount of gas available to cool.},

Using the richness distribution of the clusters, we directly measure the X-ray completeness and adopt those measurements as informative priors for the parameters of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$. We validate our cosmology analysis framework using mock data, and then in a blinded analysis of the real data we further validate the joint modeling of the cluster abundance and the weak-lensing mass calibration with a set of consistency tests. After unblinding, we obtain the cosmological constraints \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.245{\textasciicircum}\{+0.048\}\_\{-0.058\}\$, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{8\} = 0.833{\textasciicircum}\{+0.075\}\_\{-0.063\}\$ and \$S\_\{8\} {\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{8\}{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}/0.3{\textbackslash}right){\textasciicircum}\{0.3\}= 0.791{\textasciicircum}\{+0.028\}\_\{-0.031\}\$ in a flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology. Extending to a flat \$w\$CDM cosmology leads to the constraint on the equation of state parameter of the dark energy of \$w = -1.25{\textbackslash}pm 0.47\$. The eFEDS constraints are in good agreement with the results from the \$Planck\$ mission, the galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering analysis of the Dark Energy Survey, and the cluster abundance analysis of the SPT-SZ survey at a level of \${\textbackslash}lesssim1{\textbackslash}sigma\$.

We estimate the radio power at the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) location of each cluster from an analysis of Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) data. Assuming that the scaling relation between radio power and active galactic nucleus (AGN) cavity power \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cav\}\}\$ observed at low redshift does not evolve with redshift, we use these measurements in order to estimate the expected AGN cavity power in the core of each system. We estimate the X-ray luminosity within the cooling radius \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cool\}\}\$ of each cluster from a joint analysis of the available \$Chandra\$ X-ray and SPT Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data. This allows us to characterize the redshift evolution of the \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cav\}\} / L\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cool\}\}\$ ratio. When combined with low-redshift results, these constraints enable investigations of the properties of the feedback/cooling cycle across 9{\textasciitilde}Gyr of cluster growth. We model the redshift evolution of this ratio measured for cool core clusters by a log-normal distribution \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Log\}\$-\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{N\}({\textbackslash}alpha + {\textbackslash}beta z, {\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2)\$ and constrain the slope of the mean evolution \${\textbackslash}beta = -0.05{\textbackslash}pm 0.47\$. This analysis improves the constraints on the slope of this relation by a factor of two. We find no evidence of redshift evolution of the feedback/cooling equilibrium in these clusters which suggests that the onset of radio-mode feedback took place at an early stage of cluster formation. High values of \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cav\}\} / L\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cool\}\}\$ are found at the BCG location of non-cool core clusters which might suggest that the timescales of the AGN feedback cycle and the cool core / non-cool core transition are different.},

While feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is thought to be the dominant mechanism by which a cooling flow is suppressed, the \$Chandra\$ imaging observations surprisingly do not reveal the bi-lateral X-ray cavities expected in the intracluster medium (ICM) of an extreme cool core hosting a powerful radio source. We discuss the limits on the presence of any radio bubbles associated with any undetected X-ray cavities. We place upper limits on any significant X-ray AGN in the brightest cluster galaxy, and show that the X-ray peak is offset from the central radio source, which exhibits a steep low frequency radio spectrum indicative of electron ageing. The SOAR data reveal an extended, luminous emission line source. From our narrowband H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ imaging of the BCG, the central H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ peak is coincident with the radio observations, yet offset from the X-ray peak, consistent with sloshing found previously in this cluster. ALMA observations reveal a large reservoir of molecular gas that traces the extended H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission. We conclude either that the radio source and its cavities in the X-ray gas are nearly aligned along the line of sight, or that ram pressure induced by sloshing has significantly displaced the cool molecular gas feeding it, perhaps preempting the AGN feedback cycle. We argue that the sloshing near the core is likely subsonic, as expected, given the co-location of the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, CO(1-0), radio continuum, and stellar emission peaks and their proximity to the intact cool core seen in X-ray.},

	abstract = {We develop a machine learning algorithm to infer the 3D cumulative radial profiles of total and gas mass in galaxy clusters from thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) maps. By using 2,522 simulated clusters from the {\textbackslash}thethreehundred\{\} project at redshift \$z{\textless} 0.12\$, we generate more than 73,000 mock images along several lines of sight and train a model that is a combination of an autoencoder and a random forest. The model is able to reconstruct the 3D gas mass profile, responsible for the SZ effect, but also the total mass one, including the contribution of the dark matter component, without any a priori assumption on the physics of the clusters. We show that the recovered total and gas mass radial profiles are unbiased with a scatter of about \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$, slightly increasing towards the core and the outskirts of the cluster. We selected clusters in a wide mass range, \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13.5\} {\textbackslash}leq M\_\{200\} /({\textbackslash}hMsun) {\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{15.5\}\$ and spanning different dynamical states, from very relaxed to very disturbed halos. We verify that both the accuracy and precision of this method show a slight dependence on the dynamical state, but not on the cluster mass. To further check the consistency of our model, we fit the inferred total mass profiles with a NFW analytical model and compare the resulting concentration values with those of the true profiles. We observe that for higher values of the concentration, the inferred profiles are estimated without bias, reproducing a reliable mass-concentration relation. Finally, the comparison with a more standard mass estimate method, such as the hydrostatic equilibrium, shows that our technique recovers the total mass that is not affected by bias due to the non thermal motions of the gas.},

	abstract = {The magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and probably also in the interstellar medium are believed to be generated by a small-scale dynamo. Theoretically, during its kinematic stage, it is characterized by a Kazantsev spectrum, which peaks at the resistive scale. It is only slightly shallower than the Saffman spectrum that is expected for random and causally connected magnetic fields. Causally disconnected fields have the even steeper Batchelor spectrum. Here we show that all three spectra are present in the small-scale dynamo. During the kinematic stage, the Batchelor spectrum occurs on scales larger than the energy-carrying scale of the turbulence, and the Kazantsev spectrum on smaller scales within the inertial range of the turbulence -- even for a magnetic Prandtl number of unity. In the saturated state, the dynamo develops a Saffman spectrum on large scales. At large magnetic Prandtl numbers, elongated structures are seen in the parity-even E polarization, but not in the parity-odd B polarization. We also observe a significant excess in the E polarization over the B polarization at subresistive scales, and a deficiency at larger scales. This finding is at odds with the observed excess in the Galactic microwave foreground emission. The E and B polarizations become Gaussian in the saturated state, but may be highly non-Gaussian and skewed in the kinematic regime of the dynamo.},

The lens model considers 90 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images (from 30 background sources), which represents the largest secure sample for this cluster field prior to the recently acquired James Webb Space Telescope observations. The inclusion of the sub-structures within several extended sources as model constraints allows us to accurately characterize the inner total mass distribution of the cluster and the position of the cluster critical lines. We include the lensing contribution of 225 cluster members, 202 of which are spectroscopically confirmed. We also measure the internal velocity dispersion of 85 cluster galaxies to independently estimate the role of the subhalo mass component in the lens model. We investigate the effect of the cluster environment on the total mass reconstruction of the cluster core with two different mass parameterizations. We consider the mass contribution from three external clumps, either based on previous weak-lensing studies, or extended HST imaging of luminous members around the cluster core. In the latter case, the observed positions of the multiple images are better reproduced, with a remarkable accuracy of 0.37", a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim2\$ smaller than previous lens models. We develop and make publicly available a Strong Lensing Online Tool (SLOT) to exploit the predictive power and the full statistical information of this and future models, through a simple graphical interface. We plan to apply our high-precision SL model to the first analysis of the GLASS-JWST-ERS program, specifically to measure the intrinsic physical properties of high-\$z\$ galaxies from robust magnification maps.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10107},
	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2207.10107},
	abstract = {Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to provide the energy that prevents runaway cooling of gas in the cores of galaxy clusters. However, how this energy is transported and thermalized throughout the Intracluster Medium (ICM) remains unclear. In recent work we showed that streaming cosmic rays (CRs) destabilise sound waves in dilute ICM plasmas. Here we show that CR streaming in the presence of gravity also destabilises a pressure-balanced wave. We term this new instability the CR buoyancy instability (CRBI). In stark contrast to standard results without CRs, the pressure-balanced mode is highly compressible at short wavelengths due to CR streaming. Maximal growth rates are of order \$(p\_c / p\_g) {\textbackslash}beta{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\} {\textbackslash}omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$, where \$p\_c/p\_g\$ is the ratio of CR pressure to thermal gas pressure, \${\textbackslash}beta\$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure and \${\textbackslash}omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}\$ is the free-fall frequency. The CRBI operates alongside buoyancy instabilities driven by background heat fluxes, i.e. the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and the magneto-thermal instability (MTI). When the thermal mean free path \$l\_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\}\$ is \${\textbackslash}ll\$ the gas scale height \$H\$, the HBI/MTI set the growth rate on large scales, while the CRBI sets the growth rate on small scales. Conversely, when \$l\_\{{\textbackslash}rm mfp\} {\textbackslash}sim H\$ and \$(p\_c/p\_g) {\textbackslash}beta{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 1\$, CRBI growth rates exceed HBI/MTI growth rates even on large scales. Our results suggest that CR-driven instabilities may be partially responsible for the sound waves/weak shocks and turbulence observed in galaxy clusters. CR-driven instabilities generated near radio bubbles may also play an important role redistributing AGN energy throughout clusters.},

Only NGC 4874, one of the two brightest central Coma cluster galaxies, has a central energy density and pressure about five times higher and a radio source age about 50 \% lower than that of the other Coma galaxies.

However, the mechanisms by which AGN couple to the intracluster medium (ICM) are not well understood. The nature of pressure supporting the cavities is not known. Using the MUSTANG-2 instrument on the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), we aimed to measure thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect signals associated with the X-ray cavities in MS0735.6+7421, a moderate mass cluster hosting one of the most energetic AGN outbursts known. We use these measurements to infer the level of non-thermal sources of pressure, such as magnetic fields and turbulence, as well as relativistic and cosmic ray components, supporting the cavities. We used preconditioned gradient descent to fit a model for the cluster, cavities, and central point source directly to the time ordered data of the MUSTANG-2 signal. We use this model to probe the thermodynamic state of the cavities. We have shown that the SZ signal associated with the cavities is suppressed compared to the expectations for a thermal plasma with the temperature \${\textbackslash}sim\$few tens keV. The smallest value of the suppression factor \$f\$ that is consistent with the data is \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.4, lower than inferred in earlier work. Larger values of \$f\$ are possible once the contribution of the cocoon shock surrounding the bubbles is taken into account. The baseline model with this particular geometrical setup yields best-fitting value f{\textasciitilde}0.5, which at face value implies a mix of thermal and non-thermal pressure support. Larger values of \$f\$ (up to 1, i.e. no tSZ signal from the bubbles) are still possible when allowing for variations in the line-of-sight geometry.},

Here we present high fidelity MeerKAT L-band (0.9-1.7 GHz) observations of the Bullet cluster, in which we trace a larger extent of both the radio halo and relic in comparison to previous studies. The size of the recovered radio halo is 1.6 Mpc \${\textbackslash}times\$ 1.3 Mpc and the largest linear size of the relic is {\textasciitilde}988 kpc. We detect a new decrement feature on the southern outskirts of the halo emission, where a region appears to have a lower surface brightness in comparison to its surroundings. The fainter extension on the outskirts of the radio halo suggests a new wave of merger activity. An in-band spectral index map of the radio halo reveals a hint of radial steepening towards the edges of the diffuse source, likely due to synchrotron electron ageing. The integrated spectral index of the radio halo is 1.1\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.2. We perform a radio-X-ray surface brightness point-to-point analysis, which reveals a linear correlation for the radio halo. This indicates that the radio halo emission is produced by primary re-acceleration mechanisms. Finally, we derive a radio Mach number of M\_R= 5.4\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.9 for the relic shock region, which is higher than the Mach number inferred by earlier analyses based on X-ray data. Discrepancies between radio and X-ray Mach numbers have been observed for multiple systems, with studies suggesting that this is due to various factors, including relic orientation.},

We extract 49169 dark matter halos in 11 redshift bins in the range \$0{\textbackslash}leq z{\textbackslash}leq 1\$ and in three different mass bins in the range \$0.9{\textless}M\_\{200\}/10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textless}11\$. We investigate the correlation of \${\textbackslash}varsigma\$ with the redshift and the mass accretion rate (MAR) of the halos. We show that \${\textbackslash}varsigma\$ decreases from \${\textbackslash}sim 3R\_\{200\}\$ to \${\textbackslash}sim 2R\_\{200\}\$ when \$z\$ increases from 0 to \$1\$ in the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model; at \$z{\textbackslash}sim 0.1\$, \${\textbackslash}varsigma\$ decreases from \$2.75R\_\{200\}\$ to \${\textbackslash}sim 2.5R\_\{200\}\$ when the MAR increases from \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ to \${\textbackslash}sim 2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}5h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$; in the \$f(R)\$ model, \${\textbackslash}varsigma\$ is \${\textbackslash}sim 15\$\% larger than in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM. We detect \${\textbackslash}varsigma\$ and its correlation with redshift and MAR in three samples of real clusters. We consider 129 clusters of galaxies from the Cluster Infall Regions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (CIRS) and the Hectospec Cluster Survey (HeCS), and 10 additional stacked clusters from the HectoMAP survey. The clusters span the redshift range \$0.01 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.4\$ and the mass range \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{15\} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. The values of \${\textbackslash}varsigma\$ of real clusters appear consistent with both the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM and \$f(R)\$ models, because the current uncertainties on the measured mass profiles are too large. We estimate that decreasing the uncertainties by a factor of ten and distinguishing between the two theories of gravity that we investigate here requires \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 400\$ clusters, each with \${\textbackslash}sim 200\$ spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies.},

One of these targets is the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327 which acts as a gravitational lens and was recently imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope in the framework of the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey program (RELICS). To facilitate studies by the community with the upcoming JWST data, we publish here a lens model for SMACS0723 – including mass-density and magniﬁcation maps. We identify in the HST imaging ﬁve multiple-image families for three of which membership and redshift are secured by public spectroscopic data. For the remaining two systems we rely on robust photometric redshift estimates. We use here the Light-Traces-Mass lens modeling method, which complements the parametric models already available on the RELICS website and elsewhere, and thus helps span a representative range of solutions. The new models published here can be accessed via a link given belowb). It will be interesting to examine by how much and which properties of the mass models change, and improve, when JWST data are incorporated.},

His fundamental discoveries have proven to be foundational to modern cosmology; as we now know such dark matter makes up 85{\textbackslash}\% of the matter and 25{\textbackslash}\% of the mass-energy content in the universe. Galaxy clusters like Coma are massive, complex systems of dark matter in addition to hot ionized gas and thousands of galaxies, and serve as excellent probes of the dark matter distribution. However, empirical studies show that the total mass of such systems remains elusive and difficult to precisely constrain. Here, we present new estimates for the dynamical mass of the Coma cluster based on Bayesian deep learning methodologies developed in recent years. Using our novel data-driven approach, we predict Coma's \${\textbackslash}mthc\$ mass to be \$10{\textasciicircum}\{15.10 {\textbackslash}pm 0.15\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}hmsun\$ within a radius of \$1.78 {\textbackslash}pm 0.03{\textbackslash} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\$ of its center. We show that our predictions are rigorous across multiple training datasets and statistically consistent with historical estimates of Coma's mass. This measurement reinforces our understanding of the dynamical state of the Coma cluster and advances rigorous analyses and verification methods for empirical applications of machine learning in astronomy.},

	abstract = {Radio relics are Mpc-size synchrotron sources located in the outskirts of some merging galaxy clusters. Binary-merging systems with favorable orientation may host two almost symmetric relics, named double radio relics. Double radio relics are seen preferentially edge-on and, thus, constitute a privileged sample for statistical studies. Their polarization and Faraday rotation properties give direct access to the relics origin and magnetic fields. In this paper, we present a polarization and Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis study of four clusters hosting double radio relics, namely 8C 0212+703, Abell 3365, PLCK G287.0+32.9, previously missing polarization studies, and ZwCl 2341+0000, for which conflicting results have been reported. We used 1-2 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations. We also provide an updated compilation of known double radio relics with important observed quantities. We studied their polarization and Faraday rotation properties at 1.4 GHz and we searched for correlations between fractional polarization and physical resolution, distance from the cluster center, and shock Mach number. The weak correlations found between these quantities are well reproduced by state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of radio relics, confirming that merger shock waves propagate in a turbulent medium with tangled magnetic fields. Both external and internal Faraday depolarization should play a fundamental role in determining the polarization properties of radio relics at 1.4 GHz. Although the number of double radio relics with RM information is still low, their Faraday rotation properties (i.e., rest-frame RM and RM dispersion below 40 rad m\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ and non-Gaussian RM distribution) can be explained in the scenario in which shock waves with Mach numbers larger than 2.5 propagate along the plane of the sky and compress the turbulent intra-cluster medium.},

Our analysis solved a previous tension in the merger classification by confirming that the cluster pair eFEDS J093513.3+004746 and eFEDS J093510.7+004910 is undergoing a major merger with a mass ratio \$1.7\_\{-0.7\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.5\}\$. According to our two-body kinematic description, the encounter happened \$0.58\_\{-0.20\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}\$ Gyr ago, in a scenario that supports the observed radio relic position at the cluster outskirts. However, the same analysis showed that the companion cluster, eFEDS J093501.1+005418, is not gravitationally bound to the interacting system and therefore it is not part of the supercluster. We also checked the impact of adopting a scaling relation to determine the halo concentration \$c\_\{200\}\$. At the observed merger stage, where the clusters have travelled \${\textbackslash}sim\$55 per cent of the path to reach the apoapsis, the choice of the \$c\_\{200\}\$ (whether from a scaling relation or a free parameter in the mass model) does not change significantly either the cluster masses or the kinematic description.},

We present the first example of a direct interaction between a magnetic filament, a radio jet, and a dense ICM clump in the poor cluster Abell 194. This enables the first exploration of the dynamics and possible histories of magnetic fields and cosmic rays in such filaments. Our observations are from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey and the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey. Prominent 220 kpc long filaments extend east of radio galaxy 3C40B, with very faint extensions to 300 kpc, and show signs of interaction with its northern jet. They curve around a bend in the jet and intersect the jet in Faraday depth space. The X-ray surface brightness drops across the filaments; this suggests that the relativistic particles and fields contribute significantly to the pressure balance and evacuate the thermal plasma in a \${\textbackslash}sim\$35 kpc cylinder. We explore whether the relativistic electrons could have streamed along the filaments from 3C40B, and present a plausible alternative whereby magnetized filaments are a) generated by shear motions in the large-scale, post-merger ICM flow, b) stretched by interactions with the jet and flows in the ICM, amplifying the embedded magnetic fields, and c) perfused by re-energized relativistic electrons through betatron-type acceleration or diffusion of turbulently accelerated ICM cosmic ray electrons. We use the Faraday depth measurements to reconstruct some of the 3D structures of the filaments and of 3C40A and B.},

Abell 2199 displays signatures of sloshing in its core and it is possible that the orbital plane of the collision is seen nearly edge-on. We aim to evaluate whether the features of Abell 2199 can be explained by a sloshing spiral seen under a large inclination angle. To address this, we perform tailored hydrodynamical \$N\$-body simulations of a non-frontal collision with a galaxy group of \$M\_\{200\}=1.6{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$. We obtain a suitable scenario in which the group passed by the main cluster core 0.8 Gyr ago, with a pericentric separation of 292 kpc. Good agreement is obtained from the temperature maps as well as the residuals from a \${\textbackslash}beta\$-model fit to the simulated X-ray emission.

The properties of the mini-halo in RXC J0528.9-3927, a candidate mini-halo in A3322, the radio halo and candidate double relics in A3399, and the radio halo in RXC J0232.2-4420 are presented. We also report detection of candidate radio relics at distances 1 and 1.9 Mpc from the center of RXC J0232.2-4420. The southeast relic of A3399 is consistent with the radio power - mass scaling relation for radio relics, while the candidate relics around RXC J0232.2-4420 are outliers. This indicates an origin of the candidate relics near RXC J0232.2-4420 to be independent of this cluster and a cluster merger-shock origin for the relic in A3399. In this sub-sample of clusters 1/9 hosts a radio halo and double relics, 1/9 hosts a radio halo and 2/9 host mini-halos. The dynamical states based on X-ray morphology show that A3399 is a disturbed cluster; however, the radio halo cluster RXC J0232.2-4420 is relaxed, and the mini-halo clusters have intermediate morphologies, adding to the cases of the less commonly found associations.},

With partial azimuthal coverage of the northernmost cluster, we find that the inferred entropy profile of this relatively low mass cluster (\$kT {\textbackslash}approx 2.8\$ keV) adheres to expectations from models of self-similar pure gravitational collapse in the region of the virial radius. There is evidence of extended structure beyond \$r\_\{200\}\$ to the north of the northernmost cluster, along the merger axis, with properties consistent with what is expected for the warm-hot intergalacitc medium (WHIM; \$kT = 0.11\_\{-0.02\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.01\}\$ keV, \$n\_e = \{7.6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{+3.6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\}\_\{-3.6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\}\${\textasciitilde}cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$). No such emission is detected at the same radius in regions away from the merger axis, consistent with the expectation that the merger axis of this triple system lies along a large scale cosmic filament. In the bridge region between A98N and A98S, there is evidence of filamentary emission at the \$2.2{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level, as well as a tentative detection of cool gas (\$kT {\textbackslash}sim 1\$ keV). The entropy profile of this intercluster filament suggests that the A98 system is most likely aligned closer to the plane of the sky rather than along the line of sight. The structure to the north of the system, as well as in between A98N and A98S is indicative that the clusters are connected to a larger-scale structure spanning at least 4 Mpc.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06402},
	abstract = {We implement a black hole spin evolution and jet feedback model into SWIFT, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. The jet power is determined self-consistently assuming Bondi accretion, using a realistic, spin-dependant efficiency. The jets are launched along the spin axis of the black hole, resulting in natural reorientation and precession. We apply the model to idealised simulations of galaxy groups and clusters, finding that jet feedback successfully quenches gas cooling and star formation in all systems. Our group-size halo (\$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{200\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$ \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) is quenched by a strong jet episode triggered by a cooling flow, and it is kept quenched by a low-power jet fed from hot halo accretion. In more massive systems (\$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{200\}{\textbackslash}geq 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), hot halo accretion is insufficient to quench the galaxies, or to keep them quenched after the first cooling episode. These galaxies experience multiple episodes of gas cooling, star formation and jet feedback. In the most massive galaxy cluster that we simulate (\$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{200\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$ \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), we find peak cold gas masses of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and peak star formation rates of a few times \$100\$ \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. These values are achieved during strong cooling flows, which also trigger the strongest jets with peak powers of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{47\}\$ \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg\}{\textbackslash}hspace\{0.3mm\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. These jets subsequently shut off the cooling flows and any associated star formation. Jet-inflated bubbles draw out low-entropy gas that subsequently forms dense cooling filaments in their wakes, as seen in observations.},

The sample spans masses M500=[0.5 - 20] x 10e14 Msun, and lies at redshifts 0.05{\textless}z{\textless}1.13. Using XMM-Newton observations, we derive an average ICM density profile for the SZE-selected systems and determine its scaling with mass and redshift. This average profile evolves slightly stronger than self-similar (a\_z = 2.09+/-0.02), and has significant dependence on mass (a\_M = 0.22 +/- 0.01). Deviations from the average scaling with radius indicate different evolution for the core regions and the bulk. We measure the radial variation of the intrinsic scatter, finding a slight evolution with redshift. The average profile of the SZE-selected systems describes that of X-ray-selected systems at low redshift. The scaled core properties are positively skewed at later times, suggesting an increased incidence of centrally peaked objects at lower redshifts. The relation between LXc and MYx has an intrinsic scatter of 13\%. Using simulations, we investigate the impact of selection effects, intrinsic scatter, and covariance on this relation. The slope is insensitive to selection and intrinsic scatter between quantities; however, the scatter is very dependent on the covariance between LXc and Yx. Accounting for our use of the Yx proxy to determine the mass, we estimate an upper limit to the intrinsic scatter with respect to the true mass of 22\%. We probe the connection between the scatter in density profiles and that in the LXc-M relation. Our results suggest that the ICM bulk evolves approximately self-similarly, with the core regions evolving separately; indicate a variation of the gas content with mass; and show that LXc has a tight relation to the underlying mass.},

These datasets allow us to make the first measurement of this kind at \${\textbackslash}sim\$arcminute resolution. We find that the radio brightness scales as \$F\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{radio\}\} {\textbackslash}propto y{\textasciicircum}\{1.5\}\$ for Abell 401 and \$F\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{radio\}\} {\textbackslash}propto y{\textasciicircum}\{2.8\}\$ for Abell 399.

Finally, we correlate the Compton-\$y\$ and X-ray data, finding that an isothermal profile describes the two clusters well, with \$y {\textbackslash}propto F\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.5\}\$. By adopting an isothermal-\${\textbackslash}beta\$ model, we are able, for the first time, to jointly use radio, X-ray, and Compton-\$y\$ data to estimate the scaling index for the magnetic field profile, \$B(r) {\textbackslash}propto n\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{e\}\}(r){\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\$ in the injection and re-acceleration scenarios. Applying this model, we find that the combined radio and Compton-\$y\$ signal exhibits a significantly tighter correlation with the X-ray across the clusters than when the datasets are independently correlated. We find \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}sim 0.6\{-\}0.8\$. These results agree with the upper limit we derive for the scaling index of the magnetic field using rotation measure values for two radio galaxies in Abell 401. We also measure the radio, Compton-\$y\$, and X-ray correlations in the filament between the clusters but conclude that deeper data are required for a convincing determination of the correlations in the filament.},

The filaments were identified with galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey survey, ranging from 30 Mpc to 100 Mpc in length at 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.6. The stacking of the filaments is performed with the eFEDS X-ray count-rate maps in the energy range between 0.4 - 2.3 keV after masking the resolved galaxy groups and clusters and the identified X-ray point sources from the ROSAT, Chandra, XMM, and eROSITA observations. In addition, the diffuse X-ray foreground and background emissions are removed by subtracting the signal in the region between 10 - 20 Mpc from the filament spines. For the stacked signal, we perform an X-ray spectral analysis, indicating the signal is associated with a thermal emission. Assuming the plasma emission with the Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code (APEC) model and a beta-model gas distribution with beta=2/3, the detected X-ray signal can be interpreted as an emission from hot gas in the filaments with an average gas temperature of 0.8 (+0.3, -0.2) keV and a gas overdensity of 41 +- 11 at the center of the filaments.},

The mean scaled pressure in the low-\$z\$ sample is lower at small radii and higher at large radii, a trend that is accurately reproduced in similarly selected samples from The300 simulations. This difference appears to be primarily due to dynamical state at small radii, evolution at intermediate radii, and a combination of evolution and mass dependence at large radii. Furthermore, the overall flattening of the mean scaled pressure profile in the low-\$z\$ sample compared to the mid-\$z\$ sample is consistent with expectations due to differences in mass accretion rate and the fractional impact of feedback mechanisms. In agreement with previous studies, the fractional scatter about the mean scaled pressure profile reaches a minimum of \${\textbackslash}simeq 20\$ per cent near 0.5R\$\_\{500\}\$. This scatter is consistent between the low-\$z\$ and mid-\$z\$ samples at all radii, suggesting it is not strongly impacted by sample selection, and this general behavior is reproduced in The300 simulations.

Using the large volume TNG300 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project we provide predictions for X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) scaling relations for a sample of over 30,000 haloes that cover a wide mass range from galaxies to massive galaxy clusters (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 500crit\}\$ \${\textbackslash}in [10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} - 2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$]).

Thus, we investigate the scaling relations between the soft-band X-ray luminosity, spectroscopic temperature, gas mass fraction, \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}\$ and \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SZ\}\$ as a function of halo mass, and we find broad agreement between IllustrisTNG and the observed relations. Our results highlight the scatter and bias introduced by estimated masses, and thus the importance of converting simulated ICM properties to the observable space when comparing simulations to current X-ray observations. The wide range of halo masses in our sample provides new insights into the shape of the X-ray and SZ scaling relations across three orders of magnitude in mass. Our findings show strong evidence for a break in \$z=0\$ scaling relations. We introduce a smoothly broken power law model which robustly captures the location of this break, the width of the transition region around the break, as well as the slope dependence on halo mass.

Using the Mock-X pipeline, we produce synthetic X-ray images and derive cluster and galaxy group X-ray properties for a sample of over 30,000 simulated galaxy groups and clusters with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 500crit\}\$ between \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ and \$2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ in IllustrisTNG. We explore the similarities and differences between IllustrisTNG predictions of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray scaling relations with mass.

We model how different underlying assumptions about the dependence of \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}\$ on halo mass can generate biases in the observed \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SZ\} - M\_\{Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}\}\$ scaling relation. In particular, the simplifying assumption that \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\} - M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm tot\}\$ is self-similar at all mass scales largely hides the break in \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SZ\} - M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm tot\}\$ and overestimates \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SZ\}\$ at galaxy and groups scales. We show that calibrating the \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}-\$mass proxy using a new model for a smoothly broken power law reproduces the true underlying \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SZ\} - M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm tot\}\$ scaling relation with high accuracy. Moreover, \$M\_\{Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}\}\$ estimates calibrated with this method lead to \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SZ\} - M\_\{Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}\}\$ predictions that are not biased by the presence of lower mass clusters or galaxy groups in the sample. Finally, we show that our smoothly broken power law model provides a robust way to derive the \$Y\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}-\$mass proxy, significantly reducing the level of mass bias for clusters, groups, and galaxies.},

As extinction is modelled as a random field, the spatial resolution of the resulting maps is set naturally by the data available; there is no need to impose any spatial binning. We verify the validity of our scheme by testing it on simulated extinction fields and show that its precision is significantly improved over previous dust-mapping efforts. The approach we describe here can make use of any photometric, spectroscopic or astrometric data; it is not limited to any particular survey. Consequently, it can be applied to a wide range of data from both existing and future surveys.},

Here we focus on the region adjacent to the radio source 1253+275 (Radio Relic, RR hereafter). We show that the X-ray surface brightness steepest gradient at \${\textbackslash}sim 79'\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim 2.2{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textbackslash}approx R\_\{200c\}\$) is almost co-spatial with the outer edge of RR, with an offset of about \${\textbackslash}sim 100-150{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{kpc\}\$ between the derived position of the shock front and the brightest part of RR. As in several other relics, the Mach number of the shock derived from the X-ray surface brightness profile (\$M\_X{\textbackslash}approx 1.9\$) appears to be lower than needed to explain the slope of the integrated radio spectrum in the DSA model (\$M\_R{\textbackslash}approx 3.5\$) if the magnetic field is uniform and the radiative losses are fast. However, the shock geometry is plausibly much more complicated than a spherical wedge centered on the cluster, given a non-trivial correlation between radio, X-ray, and SZ images. While the complicated shock geometry alone might bias \$M\_X\$ low, we speculate on a few other processes that can affect the \$M\_X\$-\$M\_R\$ relation, including a fine structure of the shock that might be modified by the presence of non-thermal filaments stretching across the shock. We also discuss the "history" of the radio galaxy NGC4789 located ahead of the relic in the context of the Coma-NGC4839 merger scenario.},

	abstract = {We present the circumnuclear multi-phase gas properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the center of Abell 1644-South. A1644-S is the main cluster in a merging system, which is well known for X-ray hot gas sloshing in its core. The sharply peaked X-ray profile of A1644-S implies the presence of a strongly cooling gas core. In this study, we analyze ALMA CO (1-0) data, JVLA HI data, and KaVA 22 GHz data for the central region of A1644-S to probe the potential origin of the cool gas and its role in (re)powering the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find CO clumps distributed in an arc shape along the X-ray gas sloshing, which is suggestive of a connection between the cold gas and the hot intracluster medium (ICM). HI and CN are detected in absorption against the AGN continuum emission. The absorption dip is observed at the systemic velocity of the BCG with an extended, redshifted tail. Based on the spatial and spectral configurations of the HI, CN and CO gases, it is inferred that cool gas spirals into the core of the BCG, which is then fed to the central AGN. Indeed, our KaVA observation reveals a parsec-scale bipolar jet, implying that this AGN could have been (re)powered quite recently. Combining this, we suggest that some cold gas in A1644-S could have been formed from the cooling of the ICM, triggering the activity of the central AGN in the early development of a cool-core cluster.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05597},
	abstract = {We analyse the kinematical and dynamical state of the galaxy cluster RXCJ1230.7+3439, at z=0.332, using 93 new spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies acquired at the 3.6m TNG telescope and from SDSS DR16 public data. We find that RXCJ1230 appears as a clearly isolated peak in the redshift space, with a global line-of-sight velocity dispersion of \$1004\_\{-122\}{\textasciicircum}\{+147\}\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and showing a very complex structure with the presence of three subclusters. Our analyses confirm that the three substructures detected are in a pre-merger phase, where the main interaction takes place with the south-west subclump. We compute a velocity dispersion of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{v\} {\textbackslash}sim 1000\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{v\} {\textbackslash}sim 800\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for the main cluster and the south-west substructure, respectively. The central main body and south-west substructure differ by \${\textbackslash}sim 870\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in the LOS velocity. From these data, we estimate a dynamical mass of \$M\_\{200\}= 9.0 {\textbackslash}pm 1.5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \$4.4 {\textbackslash}pm 3.3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ for the RXCJ1230 main body and south-west clump, respectively, which reveals that the cluster will suffer a merging characterized by a 2:1 mass ratio impact. We solve a two-body problem for this interaction and find that the most likely solution suggests that the merging axis lies almost contained in the plane of the sky and the subcluster will fully interact in \${\textbackslash}sim0.3\$ Gyr. The comparison between the dynamical masses and those derived from X-ray data reveals a good agreement within errors (differences \${\textbackslash}sim 15\${\textbackslash}\%), which suggests that the innermost regions (\${\textless}r\_\{500\}\$) of the galaxy clumps are almost in hydrostatical equilibrium. To summarize, RXCJ1230 is a young but also massive cluster in a pre-merging phase accreeting other galaxy systems from its environment.},

	abstract = {This Chapter provides a brief tutorial on some aspects of plasma physics that are fundamental to understanding the dynamics and energetics of the intracluster medium (ICM). The tutorial is split into two parts: one that focuses on the thermal plasma component -- its stability, viscosity, conductivity, and ability to amplify magnetic fields to dynamical strengths via turbulence and other plasma processes; and one that focuses on the non-thermal population of charged particles known as cosmic rays -- their acceleration, re-acceleration, and transport throughout the cluster volume. Observational context is woven throughout the narrative, from constraints on the strength and geometry of intracluster magnetic fields and the effective viscosity of the ICM, to examples of radio halos, radio relics, and cluster shocks that can test theories of particle acceleration. The promise of future X-ray missions to probe intracluster turbulence and discover the impact of small-scale plasma physics, coupled with sensitive, high-resolution radio observations of synchrotron-emitting plasma that reveal the properties of intracluster magnetic fields and particle-acceleration mechanisms, are likely to establish galaxy clusters as the premier cosmic laboratories for deciphering the fundamental physics of hot, dilute plasmas.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01732},
	abstract = {There is considerable evidence for widespread subsonic turbulence in galaxy clusters, most notably from \{{\textbackslash}it Hitomi\}. Turbulence is often invoked to offset radiative losses in cluster cores, both by direct dissipation and by enabling turbulent heat diffusion. However, in a stratified medium, buoyancy forces oppose radial motions, making turbulence anisotropic. This can be quantified via the Froude number \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Fr\}\$, which decreases inward in clusters as stratification increases. We exploit analogies with MHD turbulence to show that wave-turbulence interactions increase cascade times and reduces dissipation rates \${\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbackslash}propto \{{\textbackslash}rm Fr\}\$. Equivalently, for a given energy injection/dissipation rate \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, turbulent velocities \$u\$ must be higher compared to Kolmogorov scalings. High resolution hydrodynamic simulations show excellent agreement with the \${\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbackslash}propto \{{\textbackslash}rm Fr\}\$ scaling, which sets in for \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Fr\} {\textless} 0.1\$. We also compare previously predicted scalings for the turbulent diffusion coefficient \$D {\textbackslash}propto \{{\textbackslash}rm Fr\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ and find excellent agreement, for \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Fr\} {\textless} 1\$. However, we find a different normalization, corresponding to stronger diffusive suppression by more than an order of magnitude. Our results imply that turbulent diffusion is more heavily suppressed by stratification, over a much wider radial range, than turbulent dissipation. Thus, the latter potentially dominates. Furthermore, this shift implies significantly higher turbulent velocities required to offset cooling, compared to previous models. These results are potentially relevant to turbulent metal diffusion (which is likewise suppressed), and to planetary atmospheres.},

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of gas matter inside galaxy clusters is not completely smooth, but may host gas clumps associated with substructures. These overdense gas substructures are generally a source of unresolved bias of X-ray observations towards high-density gas, but their bright luminosity peaks may be resolved sources within the intra cluster medium (ICM), that deep X-ray exposures may be (already) capable to detect. In this paper we aim at investigating both features, using a set of high-resolution cosmological simulations with enzo. First, we monitor how the bias by unresolved gas clumping may yield incorrect estimates of global cluster parameters and affects the measurements of baryon fractions by X-ray observations. We find that based on X-ray observations of narrow radial strips, it is difficult to recover the real baryon fraction to better than 10–20 per cent uncertainty. Secondly, we investigated the possibility of observing bright X-ray clumps in the nearby Universe (z ≤ 0.3). We produced simple mock X-ray observations for several instruments (XMM, Suzaku and ROSAT) and extracted the statistics of potentially detectable bright clumps. Some of the brightest clumps predicted by simulations may already have been already detected in X-ray images with a large field of view. However, their small projected size makes it difficult to prove their existence based on X-ray morphology only. Preheating, active galactic nuclei feedback and cosmic rays are found to have little impact on the statistical properties of gas clumps.},

	abstract = {We present a new 2 Ms Chandra observation of the cluster merger Abell 2146, which hosts two huge M{\textasciitilde}2 shock fronts each {\textasciitilde}500 kpc across. For the first time, we resolve and measure the width of cluster merger shocks. The best-fit width for the bow shock is 17+/-1 kpc and for the upstream shock is 10.7+/-0.3 kpc. A narrow collisionless shock will appear broader in projection if its smooth shape is warped by local gas motions. We show that both shock widths are consistent with collisionless shocks blurred by local gas motions of 290+/-30 km/s. The upstream shock forms later on in the merger than the bow shock and is therefore expected to be significantly narrower. From the electron temperature profile behind the bow shock, we measure the timescale for the electrons and ions to come back into thermal equilibrium. We rule out rapid thermal equilibration of the electrons with the shock-heated ions at the 6 sigma level. The observed temperature profile instead favours collisional equilibration. We find no evidence for electron heating over that produced by adiabatic compression. This supports the existing picture from collisionless shocks in the solar wind and supernova remnants. The upstream shock is consistent with this result but has a more complex structure, including a {\textasciitilde}2 keV increase in temperature {\textasciitilde}50 kpc ahead of the shock.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01765},
	abstract = {Heating from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is thought to stabilize cool-core clusters, limiting star formation and cooling flows. We employ radiative magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to model light AGN jet feedback with different accretion modes (Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton and cold accretion) in an idealised Perseus-like cluster. Independent of the probed accretion model, accretion efficiency, jet density and resolution, the cluster self-regulates with central entropies and cooling times consistent with observed cool-core clusters in this non-cosmological setting. We find that increased jet efficiencies lead to more intermittent jet powers and enhanced star formation rates. Our fiducial low-density jets can easily be deflected by orbiting cold gaseous filaments, which redistributes angular momentum and leads to more extended cold gas distributions and isotropic bubble distributions. In comparison to our fiducial low momentum-density jets, high momentum-density jet heats less efficiently and enables the formation of a persistent cold-gas disc perpendicular to the jet that is centrally confined. Cavity luminosities measured from our simulations generally reflect the cooling luminosities of the intracluster medium (ICM) and correspond to averaged jet powers that are relatively insensitive to short periods of low-luminosity jet injection. Cold gas structures in our MHD simulations with low momentum-density jets generally show a variety of morphologies ranging from discy to very extended filamentary structures. In particular, magnetic fields are crucial to inhibit the formation of unrealistically massive cold gas discs by redistributing angular momentum between the hot and cold phases and by fostering the formation of elongated cold filaments that are supported by magnetic pressure.},

	abstract = {We investigate the importances of various dynamical features in predicting the dynamical state (DS) of galaxy clusters, based on the Random Forest (RF) machine learning approach. We use a large sample of galaxy clusters from the Three Hundred Project of hydrodynamical zoomed-in simulations, and construct dynamical features from the raw data as well as from the corresponding mock maps in the optical, X-ray, and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) channels. Instead of relying on the impurity based feature importance of the RF algorithm, we directly use the out-of-bag (OOB) scores to evaluate the importances of individual features and different feature combinations. Among all the features studied, we find the virial ratio, \${\textbackslash}eta\$, to be the most important single feature. The features calculated directly from the simulations and in 3-dimensions carry more information on the DS than those constructed from the mock maps. Compared with the features based on X-ray or SZ maps, features related to the centroid positions are more important. Despite the large number of investigated features, a combination of up to three features of different types can already saturate the score of the prediction. Lastly, we show that the most sensitive feature \${\textbackslash}eta\$ is strongly correlated with the well-known half-mass bias in dynamical modelling. Without a selection in DS, cluster halos have an asymmetric distribution in \${\textbackslash}eta\$, corresponding to an overall positive half-mass bias. Our work provides a quantitative reference for selecting the best features to discriminate the DS of galaxy clusters in both simulations and observations.},

	abstract = {Galaxy clusters are promising probes of precision cosmology. Their ability to deliver precise, unbiased, results depends on a better understanding of the intracluster medium (ICM). Active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by the central Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs) play a major role in modifying the thermal properties of the ICM. Therefore, understanding the AGN feedback mechanism is essential for cluster cosmology. In this work, we implement two AGN heating models: (i) by buoyant cavities rising through stratified ICM (Effervescent model) and, (ii) by viscous and conductive dissipation of sound waves (Acoustic model). Our aim is to determine whether these heating models are consistent with ICM observables and if one is preferred over the other. We study the evolution of ICM thermal profiles with effervescent and acoustic models of AGN heating. We assume an initial entropy profile of ICM expected from the purely gravitational infall of the gas in the potential of the dark matter halo. We then incorporate heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction over the age of the clusters. Our results are: (i) We find that both heating processes match well with observations, with some tuning of relevant parameters. (ii) Thermal conduction is crucially important, even at the level of 10{\textbackslash}\% of the Spitzer values, in transferring the injected energy beyond the central regions, and without which the temperature/entropy profiles do not match with observations. (iii) We show that the required injected AGN power scales with cluster mass as \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textasciicircum}\{1.5\}\$ for both models. (iv) Moreover, the required AGN luminosity is comparable with the observed radio jet power, reinforcing the idea that AGNs provide the most dominant heating sources in clusters. (v) Finally, we estimate that the fraction of the total AGN luminosity available as the AGN mechanical luminosity at \$0.02r\_\{500\}\$ is less than 0.05{\textbackslash}\%.},

Two other objects are lower than this limit when two thermal components are used. Half of the objects examined have an upper limit on the velocity broadening of less than 700 km s−1. To look for objects which have significant turbulent broadening, we use Chandra spectral maps to compute the expected broadening caused by the spatial extent of the source. Comparing these with our observed results, we find that Klemola 44 has extra broadening at the level of 1500 km s−1. RX J1347.5-1145 shows weak evidence for turbulent velocities at 800 km s−1.

This has been observed in simulations of rigid objects moving through magnetised media and sloshing galaxy clusters, and then applied in interpreting observations of merger cold fronts. Using a suite of MHD simulations of binary cluster mergers, we show that even magnetic field strengths stronger than yet observed (\${\textbackslash}beta = P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm th\}/P\_B = 50\$) show visible KHI features. This is because our initial magnetic field is tangled, producing Alfven waves and associated velocity fluctuations in the ICM; stronger initial fields therefore seed larger fluctuations, so that even a reduced growth rate due to magnetic tension produces a significant KHI. The net result is that a stronger initial magnetic field produces more dramatic fluctuations in surface brightness and temperature, not the other way around. We show that this is hard to distinguish from the evolution of turbulent perturbations of the same initial magnitude. Therefore, in order to use observations of KHI in the ICM to infer magnetic field strengths by comparing to idealized simulations, the perturbations which seed the KHI must be well-understood and (if possible) carefully controlled.},

Their flow is a neural network (NN) whose parameters are predicted by another NN. The latter grows quadratically with the size of the former and thus an efficient technique for parametrization is needed. We propose block neural autoregressive flow (B-NAF), a much more compact universal approximator of density functions, where we model a bijection directly using a single feed-forward network. Invertibility is ensured by carefully designing each affine transformation with block matrices that make the flow autoregressive and (strictly) monotone. We compare B-NAF to NAF and other established flows on density estimation and approximate inference for latent variable models.

In this paper, we examine the two scenarios for the seed electrons with the observed statistical properties of RHs, combining two methods: following the temporal evolutions of the electron energy and radial distributions in a cluster, and the merger history of clusters. We find that the RH lifetime largely depends on the seed origin, as it could be longer than the cosmological timescale in the secondary scenario. We study the condition for the onset of RHs with the observed RH fraction and the RH lifetime we obtained, and find that long-lived RHs in the secondary scenario should be originated from major mergers with a mass ratio of \${\textbackslash}xi{\textbackslash}sim0.1\$, while the short lifetime in the primary scenario requires more frequent onsets by minor mergers with \${\textbackslash}xi{\textbackslash}sim0.01\$. Our simple model of the turbulence acceleration can reproduce the observed radio luminosity-mass relation. The RH luminosity functions we obtained suggest that the expected RH number count with the ASKAP survey will detect \${\textbackslash}approx10{\textasciicircum}3\$ RHs in both the scenarios.},

	abstract = {We present LOw Frequency ARray observations of the Coma cluster field at 144{\textbackslash},MHz. The cluster hosts one of the most famous radio halos, a relic, and a low surface-brightness bridge. We detect new features that allow us to make a step forward in the understanding of particle acceleration in clusters. The radio halo extends for more than 2 Mpc, which is the largest extent ever reported. To the North-East of the cluster, beyond the Coma virial radius, we discover an arc-like radio source that could trace particles accelerated by an accretion shock. To the West of the halo, coincident with a shock detected in the X-rays, we confirm the presence of a radio front, with different spectral properties with respect to the rest of the halo. We detect a radial steepening of the radio halo spectral index between 144 MHz and 342 MHz, at \${\textbackslash}sim 30{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}\$ from the cluster centre, that may indicate a non constant re-acceleration time throughout the volume. We also detect a mild steepening of the spectral index towards the cluster centre. For the first time, a radial change in the slope of the radio-X-ray correlation is found, and we show that such a change could indicate an increasing fraction of cosmic ray versus thermal energy density in the cluster outskirts. Finally, we investigate the origin of the emission between the relic and the source NGC 4789, and we argue that NGC4789 could have crossed the shock originating the radio emission visible between its tail and the relic.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The exploitation of clusters of galaxies as cosmological probes relies on accurate measurements of their total gravitating mass. X-ray observations provide a powerful means of probing the total mass distribution in galaxy clusters, but might be affected by observational biases and rely on simplistic assumptions originating from our limited understanding of the intracluster medium physics.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}This paper is aimed at elucidating the reliability of X-ray total mass estimates in clusters of galaxies by properly disentangling various biases of both observational and physical origin.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We use {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-body/SPH simulation of a large sample of {\textasciitilde}100 galaxy clusters and investigate total mass biases by comparing the mass reconstructed adopting an observational-like approach with the true mass in the simulations. X-ray surface brightness and temperature profiles extracted from the simulations are fitted with different models and adopting different radial fitting ranges in order to investigate modeling and extrapolation biases. Different theoretical definitions of gas temperature are used to investigate the effect of spectroscopic temperatures and a power ratio analysis of the surface brightness maps allows us to assess the dependence of the mass bias on cluster dynamical state. Moreover, we perform a study on the reliability of hydrostatic and hydrodynamical equilibrium mass estimates using the full three-dimensional information in the simulation.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}A model with a low degree of sophistication such as the polytropic {\textless}i{\textgreater}β{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-model can introduce, in comparison with a more adequate model, an additional mass underestimate of the order of {\textasciitilde}10\% at {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and {\textasciitilde}15\% at {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}200{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. Underestimates due to extrapolation alone are at most of the order of {\textasciitilde}10\% on average, but can be as large as {\textasciitilde}50\% for individual objects. Masses are on average biased lower for disturbed clusters than for relaxed ones and the scatter of the bias rapidly increases with increasingly disturbed dynamical state. The bias originating from spectroscopic temperatures alone is of the order of 10\% at all radii for the whole numerical sample, but strongly depends on both dynamical state and cluster mass. From the full three dimensional information in the simulations we find that the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption yields masses underestimated by {\textasciitilde}10–15\% and that masses computed by means of the hydrodynamical estimator are unbiased. Finally, we show that there is excellent agreement between our findings, results from similar analyses based on both Eulerian and Lagrangian simulations, and recent observational work based on the comparison between X-ray and gravitational lensing mass estimates.},

	abstract = {The classification of galaxy clusters according to their X-ray appearance is a powerful tool to discriminate between regular clusters (associated to relaxed objects) and disturbed ones (linked to dynamically active systems). The compilation of the two subsamples is a necessary step both for cosmological studies- oriented towards spherical and virialized systems- and for astrophysical investigations - focused on phenomena typically present in highly disturbed galaxy clusters such as turbulence, particle re-acceleration, magneto-astrophysics.In this paper, we review several morphological parameters: asymmetry and fluctuation of the X-ray surface brightness, hardness ratios, X-ray surface-brightness concentration, centroid shift, and third-order power ratio. We test them against 60 Chandra-like images obtained from hydrodynamical simulations through the X-ray Map Simulator and visually classified as regular and disturbed.The best performances are registered when the parameters are computed using the largest possible region (either within R500 or 1000 kpc). The best indicators are the third-order power ratio, the asymmetry parameter, and the X-ray-surface-brightness concentration. All their combinations offer an efficient way to distinguish between the two morphological classes achieving values of purity extremely close to 1. A new parameter, M, is defined. It combines the strengths of the aforementioned indicators and, therefore, resulted to be the most effective parameter analyzed.},

	abstract = {In this work, we examine the effects of mergers on the hydrostatic mass estimate of galaxy clusters using high-resolution Eulerian cosmological simulations. We utilize merger trees to isolate the last merger for each cluster in our sample and follow the time evolution of the hydrostatic mass bias as the systems relax. We find that during a merger, a shock propagates outward from the parent cluster, resulting in an overestimate in the hydrostatic mass bias. After the merger, as a cluster relaxes, the bias in hydrostatic mass estimate decreases but remains at a level of -5\%-10\% with 15\%-20\% scatter within r 500. We also investigate the post-merger evolution of the pressure support from bulk motions, a dominant cause of this residual mass bias. At r 500, the contribution from random motions peaks at 30\% of the total pressure during the merger and quickly decays to {\textasciitilde}10\%-15\% as a cluster relaxes. Additionally, we use a measure of the random motion pressure to correct the hydrostatic mass estimate. We discover that 4 Gyr after mergers, the direct effects of the merger event on the hydrostatic mass bias have become negligible. Thereafter, the mass bias is primarily due to residual bulk motions in the gas which are not accounted for in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. We present a hydrostatic mass bias correction method that can recover the unbiased cluster mass for relaxed clusters with 9\% scatter at r 500 and 11\% scatter in the outskirts, within r 200.},

	abstract = {We provide an analytic framework for interpreting observations of multiphase circumgalactic gas that is heavily informed by recent numerical simulations of thermal instability and precipitation in cool-core galaxy clusters. We start by considering the local conditions required for the formation of multiphase gas via two different modes: (1) uplift of ambient gas by galactic outflows, and (2) condensation in a stratified stationary medium in which thermal balance is explicitly maintained. Analytic exploration of these two modes provides insights into the relationships between the local ratio of the cooling and freefall timescales (i.e., ), the large-scale gradient of specific entropy, and the development of precipitation and multiphase media in circumgalactic gas. We then use these analytic findings to interpret recent simulations of circumgalactic gas in which global thermal balance is maintained. We show that long-lasting configurations of gas with and radial entropy profiles similar to observations of cool cores in galaxy clusters are a natural outcome of precipitation-regulated feedback. We conclude with some observational predictions that follow from these models. This work focuses primarily on precipitation and AGN feedback in galaxy-cluster cores, because that is where the observations of multiphase gas around galaxies are most complete. However, many of the physical principles that govern condensation in those environments apply to circumgalactic gas around galaxies of all masses.},

The most conservative determination of the 90 per cent upper limit on line-of-sight, non-thermal, velocity broadening is 274 km s−1, measured from the emission lines originating within 30 kpc radius. The ratio of turbulent to thermal energy density in the core is therefore less than 13 per cent. There are no emission lines in the spectrum showing evidence for gas below ∼3.5 keV.

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samples efficiently from high-dimensional posterior distributions with proposed parameter draws obtained by iterating on a discretized version of the Hamiltonian dynamics. The iterations make HMC computationally costly, especially in problems with large datasets, since it is necessary to compute posterior densities and their derivatives with respect to the parameters. Naively computing the Hamiltonian dynamics on a subset of the data causes HMC to lose its key ability to generate distant parameter proposals with high acceptance probability. The key insight in our article is that efficient subsampling HMC for the parameters is possible if both the dynamics and the acceptance probability are computed from the same data subsample in each complete HMC iteration. We show that this is possible to do in a principled way in a HMC-within-Gibbs framework where the subsample is updated using a pseudo marginal MH step and the parameters are then updated using an HMC step, based on the current subsample. We show that our subsampling methods are fast and compare favorably to two popular sampling algorithms that utilize gradient estimates from data subsampling. We also explore the current limitations of subsampling HMC algorithms by varying the quality of the variance reducing control variates used in the estimators of the posterior density and its gradients.},

We measured the ICL fraction in three broadband optical filters, F435W, F606W, and F814W, without assuming any prior hypothesis about the ICL physical properties or morphology. The results obtained from the ICL fraction vary between {\textasciitilde}7\% - 25\%, and {\textasciitilde}3\% - 22\% for both A370 and AS1063, respectively, which are consistent with theoretical predictions for the total amount of ICL obtained by ICL formation and evolution simulations.We found enhanced ICL fractions in the intermediate filter F606W for both clusters and we suggest that this is due to the presence of an excess of younger/lower-metallicity stars in the ICL compared to the cluster galaxies. We conclude that both Abell 370 and Abell S1063 are merging systems since they exhibit a similar feature as merging CLASH and Frontier Fields clusters sub-sample previously analyzed.

We identify \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sp\}\$ by extracting the steepest radial gradient in a stacked set of clusters in 0.5 dex wide mass bins, with our clusters having halo masses \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} {\textbackslash}leq M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 200, mean\} / \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$. We apply cuts in subhalo mass, galaxy stellar mass, \$i\$-band absolute magnitude and specific star formation rate. We find that, generally, galaxies of increasing mass and luminosity trace smaller measured splashback radii relative to the intrinsic dark matter radius. We also show that quenched galaxies may be used to reliably reconstruct the dark matter splashback radius. This trend is likely due to changes in the galaxy population. Additionally, we are able to reconcile different observational predictions that \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sp\}\$ based upon galaxy number counts and dark matter may either align or show significant offset (e.g. those using optically- or SZ-selected clusters) through the selection functions that these studies employ. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sp\}\$ measured through number counts are not due to a simple change in galaxy abundance inside and outside of the cluster.},

Recent X-ray observations suggested that self-similarity may be broken in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. In this work, we analyze a mass-limited sample of massive galaxy clusters from the Omega500 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to investigate the self-similarity of the diffuse X-ray emitting intracluster medium (ICM) in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. We find that the self-similarity of the outer ICM profiles is better preserved if they are normalized with respect to the mean density of the universe, while the inner profiles are more self-similar when normalized using the critical density. However, the outer ICM profiles as well as the location of accretion shock around clusters are sensitive to their mass accretion rate, which causes the apparent breaking of self-similarity in cluster outskirts. We also find that the collisional gas does not follow the distribution of collisionless dark matter (DM) perfectly in the infall regions of galaxy clusters, leading to 10\% departures in the gas-to-DM density ratio from the cosmic mean value. Our results have a number implications for interpreting observations of galaxy clusters in X-ray and through the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect, and their applications to cosmology.},

	abstract = {The 21-cm emission from atomic hydrogen (HI) is one of the most important tracers of the structure and dynamics of the interstellar medium. Thanks to Galactic rotation, the line is Doppler shifted and, assuming a model for the velocity field, data from gas line surveys can be deprojected along the line of sight. However, given our vantage point in the Galaxy, such a reconstruction suffers from a number of ambiguities. Here, we argue that those can be cured by exploiting the spatial coherence of the gas density that is implied by the physical processes shaping it. We have adopted a Bayesian inference framework that allows reconstructing the three-dimensional map of HI and quantifying its uncertainty. We employ data from the HI4PI compilation to produce three-dimensional maps of Galactic HI. The reconstructed density shows structure on a variety of scales. In particular, some spurs and spiral arms can be identified with ease. We discuss the morphology of the surface mass density and the radial and vertical profiles. The reconstructed three-dimensional HI densities are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5956696.},

	abstract = {MS 0735.6+7421 (\$z = 0.216\$) is a massive cool core galaxy cluster hosting one of the most powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) outbursts known. The radio jets of the AGN have carved out an unusually large pair of X-ray cavities, each reaching a diameter of \$200\$ kpc. This makes MS 0735.6+7421 a unique case to investigate active galactic nuclei feedback processes, as well as other cluster astrophysics at radio wavelengths. We present new low-radio-frequency observations of MS 0735.6+7421 taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA): 5 hours of P-band (\$224-480\$ MHz) and 5 hours of L-band (\$1-2\$ GHz) observations, both in C configuration. Our VLA P-band (\$224-480\$ MHz) observations reveal the presence of a new diffuse radio component reaching a scale of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ \$900\$ kpc in the direction of the jets and of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ \$500\$ kpc in the direction perpendicular to the jets. This component is centered on the cluster core and has a radio power scaled at \$1.4\$ GHz of \$P\_\{1.4{\textbackslash}text\{ GHz\}\} = (4{\textbackslash}pm2){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{24\}\$ WHz\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Its properties are consistent with those expected from a radio mini-halo as seen in other massive cool core clusters, although it may also be associated with radio plasma that has diffused out of the X-ray cavities. Observations at higher spatial resolution are needed to fully characterize the properties and nature of this component. We also suggest that if radio mini-halos originate from jetted activity, we may be witnessing the early stages of this process.},

	abstract = {There is a tension between robustness and efficiency when designing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms. Here we focus on robustness with respect to tuning parameters, showing that more sophisticated algorithms tend to be more sensitive to the choice of step-size parameter and less robust to heterogeneity of the distribution of interest. We characterise this phenomenon by studying the behaviour of spectral gaps as an increasingly poor step-size is chosen for the algorithm. Motivated by these considerations, we propose a novel and simple gradient-based MCMC algorithm, inspired by the classical Barker accept-reject rule, with improved robustness properties. Extensive theoretical results, dealing with robustness to tuning, geometric ergodicity and scaling with dimension, suggest that the novel scheme combines the robustness of simple schemes with the efficiency of gradient-based ones. We show numerically that this type of robustness is particularly beneficial in the context of adaptive MCMC, giving examples where our proposed scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.},

	abstract = {Distortions of the observed cosmic microwave background imprinted by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect toward massive galaxy clusters due to inverse Compton scattering of microwave photons by high-energy electrons provide a direct measurement of the microwave background temperature at redshifts from 0 to 1. Some additional background temperature estimates exist at redshifts from 1.8 to 3.3 based on molecular and atomic line excitation temperatures in quasar absorption line systems, but are model dependent. To date, no deviations from the expected (1+z) scaling behavior of the microwave background temperature have been seen, but the measurements have not extended deeply into the matter-dominated era of the universe at redshifts z{\textgreater}3.3. Here we report the detection of sub-millimeter line absorption from the water molecule against the cosmic microwave background at z=6.34 in a massive starburst galaxy, corresponding to a lookback time of 12.8 Gyr. Radiative pumping of the upper level of the ground-state ortho-H2O(110-101) line due to starburst activity in the dusty galaxy HFLS3 results in a cooling to below the redshifted microwave background temperature, after the transition is initially excited by the microwave background. The strength of this effect implies a microwave background temperature of 16.4-30.2 K (1-sigma range) at z=6.34, which is consistent with a background temperature increase with redshift as expected from the standard CDM cosmology.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00910v1},
	abstract = {N-body simulation is an invaluable tool to understand cosmic velocity field. However, simulation samples velocity only at particle locations that leads to information loss when projecting velocity fields onto structured grid. Here we extract two-point statistics without field projection. These statistics, i.e. correlation/structure/dispersion functions in real space and spectrum functions in Fourier space, are modeled on both small and large scales. Kinematic relations between statistical measures are fully developed for incompressible, constant divergence, and irrotational flow. The nature of flow can be identified by these relations. Much more complex than incompressible flow, peculiar velocity of dark matter flow is of constant divergence on small scale and irrotational on large scale. Incompressible and constant divergence flow share same kinematic relations for even order correlations. The limiting correlation of velocity \${\textbackslash}rho\_L=1/2\$ on the smallest scale (\$r=0\$) is a unique feature of collisionless flow (\${\textbackslash}rho\_L=1\$ for incompressible flow). Assuming gravity is the only interaction and no radiation produced, this feature leads to an increase in particle mass converted from kinetic energy upon "annihilation". On large scale, transverse velocity correlation has an exponential form with a comoving scale \$r\_2\$=21.3Mpc/h that maybe related to the size of sound horizon. All other correlation/structure/dispersion/spectrum functions for velocity/density/potential are derived analytically from kinematic relations for irrotational flow. On small scale, longitudinal structure function follows one-fourth law of \$S{\textasciicircum}l\_2{\textbackslash}propto r{\textasciicircum}\{1/4\}\$. All other statistical measures are obtained from kinematic relations for constant divergence flow. Vorticity is negatively correlated for \$r\$ between 1 and 7Mpc/h. Divergence is negatively correlated for \$r\${\textgreater}30Mpc/h that leads to negative density correlation.},

	abstract = {It is well established that brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), residing in the center of galaxy clusters, are typically massive and quenched galaxies with cD or elliptical morphology. An optical survey suggested that an exotic galaxy population, superluminous spiral and lenticular galaxies could be the BCGs of some galaxy clusters. Because the cluster membership and the centroid of a cluster cannot be accurately determined based solely on optical data, we followed up a sample of superluminous disk galaxies and their environment using XMM-Newton X-ray observations. Specifically, we explored seven superluminous spiral and lenticular galaxies that are candidate BCGs. We detected massive galaxy clusters around five superluminous disk galaxies and established that one superluminous spiral, 2MASX J16273931+3002239, is the central BCG of a galaxy cluster. The temperature and total mass of the cluster are \$kT\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 500\}=3.55{\textasciicircum}\{+0.18\}\_\{-0.20\}\$ keV and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 500\} = (2.39 {\textbackslash}pm 0.19) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\} \$. We identified the central galaxies of the four clusters that do not host the superluminous disk galaxy at their cores and established that the centrals are massive elliptical galaxies. However, for two of the clusters, the offset superluminous spirals are brighter than the central galaxies, implying that the superluminous disk galaxies are the brightest cluster galaxies. Our results demonstrate that superluminous disk galaxies are rarely the central systems of galaxy clusters. This is likely because galactic disks are destroyed by major mergers, which are more frequent in high-density environments. We speculate that the disks of superluminous disk galaxies in cluster cores may have been re-formed due to mergers with a gas-rich satellite.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12591},
	abstract = {We carry out a thermal energy census of hot baryons at \$z {\textless} 1\$, by cross-correlating the Planck MILCA y-map with over 40 DESI galaxy cluster/group subsamples constructed from the Yang et. al (2021) catalog. In our investigation, we select 0.8 million clusters/groups with richness \${\textbackslash}geq 5\$ and estimated halo mass \${\textbackslash}geq 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot/h\$. The detection of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect is significant in the investigated clusters/groups. (1) The total measurement S/N of the one-halo term is 65. We constrain the \$Y-M\$ relation over the halo mass range of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{15\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot/h\$. We find \$Y{\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ with \${\textbackslash}alpha= 1.8\$ at \$z=0.14\$ and \${\textbackslash}alpha=2.1\$ at \$z=0.75\$. The total thermal energy of gas bound to clusters/groups increases from \$0.11 {\textbackslash}rm meV/cm{\textasciicircum}3\$ at \$z=0.14\$ to \$0.23 {\textbackslash}rm meV/cm{\textasciicircum}3\$ at \$z=0.75\$. (2) The two-halo term measurement constrains the bias-weighted electron pressure \${\textbackslash}langle b\_yP\_e {\textbackslash}rangle\$. We find that \${\textbackslash}langle b\_yP\_e {\textbackslash}rangle\$ (in unit of \${\textbackslash}rm meV/cm{\textasciicircum}3\$) increases from \$0.25{\textbackslash}pm 0.03\$ at \$z=0.14\$ to \$0.55{\textbackslash}pm 0.04\$ at \$z=0.75\$. These results lead to several implications. (i) The hot gas fraction \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}\$ in clusters/groups monotonically increase with halo mass, where \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}\$ of a \$10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot/h\$ halo is \${\textbackslash}sim 50{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\$20{\textbackslash}\%\$) of the cosmic mean at \$z=0.14{\textbackslash} (0.75)\$. (ii) By comparing the 1h- and 2h-terms, we constrain the thermal energy of unbound gas. (iii) The above results lead to a suppression of matter and weak lensing power spectrum. At \$l=10{\textasciicircum}3 {\textbackslash} (10{\textasciicircum}4)\$, the suppression is \${\textbackslash}sim 7{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash} (17{\textbackslash}\%)\$ for source galaxies at \$z\_s=1\$. These implications are potentially important for gastrophysics and cosmology, although they suffer from uncertainties in measurements (Planck resolution, cluster mass/redshift determination, etc) and gas modeling to be further investigated.},

	abstract = {The galaxy cluster Abell 523 (A523) hosts an extended diffuse synchrotron source historically classified as a radio halo. Its radio power at 1.4 GHz makes it one of the most significant outliers in the scaling relations between observables derived from multi-wavelength observations of galaxy clusters: it has a morphology that is different and offset from the thermal gas, and it has polarized emission at 1.4 GHz typically difficult to observe for this class of sources. A magnetic field fluctuating on large spatial scales ({\textasciitilde} 1 Mpc) can explain these peculiarities but the formation mechanism for this source is not yet completely clear. To investigate its formation mechanism, we present new observations obtained with the LOw Frequency ARray at 120-168 MHz and the Jansky Very Large Array at 1-2 GHz, which allow us to study the spectral index distribution of this source. According to our data the source is observed to be more extended at 144 MHz than previously inferred at 1.4 GHz, with a total size of about 1.8 Mpc and a flux density S\_144MHz = (1.52 +- 0.31) Jy. The spectral index distribution of the source is patchy with an average spectral index alpha {\textasciitilde} 1.2 between 144 MHz and 1.410 GHz, while an integrated spectral index alpha {\textasciitilde} 2.1 has been obtained between 1.410 GHz and 1.782 GHz. A previously unseen patch of steep spectrum emission is clearly detected at 144 MHz in the south of the cluster. Overall, our findings suggest that we are observing an overlapping of different structures, powered by the turbulence associated with the primary and a possible secondary merger.},

We apply this ﬁlter on different scales to Chandra X-ray observatory images of two clusters with active galactic nucleus feedback, the Perseus cluster and M 87, and a merging system, A 3667. By combining ﬁltered images on different scales using radial ﬁlters spectacular images of the edges in a cluster are produced. We describe how to assess the signiﬁcance of features in ﬁltered images. We ﬁnd the gradient ﬁltering technique to have signiﬁcant advantages for detecting many kinds of features compared to other analysis techniques, such as unsharp masking. Filtering cluster images in this way in a hard energy band allows shocks to be detected.},

	abstract = {Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to be the most promising solution to the cooling flow problem in cool-core clusters, though how exactly the jet energy is transformed into heat is a subject of debate. Dissipation of sound waves is considered as one of the possible heating mechanisms; however, its relative contribution to heating remains unclear. To estimate the energy budget for heating, we perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of AGN jet injections in a Perseus-like cluster and quantify the amount of energy stored in the forms of weak shocks and waves. We find that, for a single jet injection with typical parameters in cool-core clusters, \${\textbackslash}sim9{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total jet energy is stored in compressional waves (including both shocks and waves). However, due to the destructive effects among randomly phased waves as well as the dissipation of shock energies, in our simulations including self-regulated AGN feedback, no more than \$3{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total injected energy goes into compressional waves. We further separate the energy contribution from shocks and waves and find that, for a single outburst, the shocks can only contribute to \${\textbackslash}sim20-30{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total compressional energy in the inner radii, and they dissipate very quickly as they travel outward. However, because of the repeated generation of shocks by multiple AGN outbursts, in the self-regulated case shocks completely dominate over sound waves in the inner region and can still provide \${\textbackslash}sim40-50{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total compressional energy even at outer radii. Our results suggest that the production of sound waves is not as efficient as what was found in previous single-outburst simulations, and thus sound wave dissipation may be a subdominant source of heating in cool-core clusters.},

	abstract = {Complex systems (stars, supernovae, galaxies, and clusters) often exhibit low scatter relations between observable properties (e.g., luminosity, velocity dispersion, oscillation period, temperature). These scaling relations can illuminate the underlying physics and can provide observational tools for estimating masses and distances. Machine learning can provide a systematic way to search for new scaling relations (or for simple extensions to existing relations) in abstract high-dimensional parameter spaces. We use a machine learning tool called symbolic regression (SR), which models the patterns in a given dataset in the form of analytic equations. We focus on the Sunyaev-Zeldovich flux\$-\$cluster mass relation (\$Y\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SZ\}-M\$), the scatter in which affects inference of cosmological parameters from cluster abundance data. Using SR on the data from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, we find a new proxy for cluster mass which combines \$Y\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SZ\}\$ and concentration of ionized gas (\$c\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gas\}\$): \$M {\textbackslash}propto Y\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{conc\}{\textasciicircum}\{3/5\} {\textbackslash}equiv Y\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SZ\}{\textasciicircum}\{3/5\} (1-A{\textbackslash}, c\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gas\})\$. \$Y\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{conc\}\$ reduces the scatter in the predicted \$M\$ by \${\textbackslash}sim 20-30\$\% for large clusters (\$M{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) at both high and low redshifts, as compared to using just \$Y\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SZ\}\$. We show that the dependence on \$c\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gas\}\$ is linked to cores of clusters exhibiting larger scatter than their outskirts. Finally, we test \$Y\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{conc\}\$ on clusters from simulations of the CAMELS project and show that \$Y\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{conc\}\$ is robust against variations in cosmology, astrophysics, subgrid physics, and cosmic variance. Our results and methodology can be useful for accurate multiwavelength cluster mass estimation from current and upcoming CMB and X-ray surveys like ACT, SO, SPT, eROSITA and CMB-S4.},

	abstract = {Matter distribution in the environment of galaxy clusters, from their cores to their connected cosmic filaments, must be in principle related to the underlying cluster physics and it evolutionary state. We aim to investigate how radial and azimuthal distribution of gas is affected by cluster environments, and how it can be related to cluster mass assembly history. Radial physical properties of gas (velocity, temperature, and density) is first analysed around 415 galaxy cluster environments from IllustrisTNG simulation at z=0. Whereas hot plasma is virialised inside clusters ({\textless} R200), the dynamics of warm hot inter-galactic medium (WHIM) can be separated in two regimes: accumulating and slowly infalling gas at cluster peripheries ({\textasciitilde} R200) and fast infalling motions outside clusters ({\textgreater} 1.5 R200). The azimuthal distribution of dark matter (DM), hot and warm gas phases is secondly statistically probed by decomposing their 2-D distribution in harmonic space. Inside clusters, the azimuthal symmetries of DM and hot gas are well tracing cluster structural properties, such as their center offsets, substructure fractions and elliptical shapes. Beyond cluster virialised regions, we found that WHIM gas follows the azimuthal distribution of DM by tracing cosmic filament patterns. Azimuthal symmetries of hot and warm gas distribution is finally shown to be imprints of cluster mass assembly history, by strongly correlating with the formation time, mass accretion rate, and dynamical state of clusters. Azimuthal mode decomposition of 2-D gas distribution is a promising probe to assess the 3-D physical and dynamical cluster properties up to their connected cosmic filaments.},

Although trivial in principle, these comparisons are not always simple. We demonstrate that the projected spectroscopic temperature of thermally complex clusters obtained from X-ray observations is always lower than the emission-weighed temperature, which is widely used in the analysis of numerical simulations. We show that this temperature bias is mainly related to the fact that the emission-weighted temperature does not reﬂect the actual spectral properties of the observed source. This has important implications for the study of thermal structures in clusters, especially when strong temperature gradients, such as shock fronts, are present. Because of this bias, in real observations shock fronts appear much weaker than what is predicted by emission-weighted temperature maps, and may not even be detected. This may explain why, although numerical simulations predict that shock fronts are a quite common feature in clusters of galaxies, to date there are very few observations of objects in which they are clearly seen. To ﬁx this problem we propose a new formula, the spectroscopic-like temperature function, and show that, for temperatures higher than 3 keV, it approximates the spectroscopic temperature to better than a few per cent, making simulations more directly comparable to observations.},

	abstract = {We consider a situation in which a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) moves in ambient hot gas in the central region of a cool core cluster of galaxies, following the study by Inoue (2014, PASJ, 66, 60). In the rest frame of the BCG, the hot gas is supposed to flow toward the BCG in parallel from a sufficiently large distance. Then, it is expected that only the gas flowing with the impact parameter less than a critical value is trapped by the gravitation field of the BCG because of the efficient radiative cooling, getting a cooling flow, and that the remaining outer gas can get over the potential well. In such a circumstance, we can draw the following picture: A boundary layer between the out-flowing gas and the trapped gas arises around the stagnation point at the back side of the BCG. Since the boundary temperature is so low as to be X-ray dim, the boundary could be observed as the cold front in X-rays. The trapped gas once stagnates on the inner side of the boundary and starts in-falling toward the BCG. Since the wandering motion of the BCG is likely to have a rotational component, the Coriolis force induces a rotational motion in the in-falling flow from the stagnation place to the BCG, forming a spiral structure around the BCG. The spiraling flow turns the BCG on the up stream side of the main flow from the far outside, and arises another boundary layer having contact discontinuity with the main hot gas flow. These pictures well reproduce the observed features such as cool cores, cold fronts, and spiral structures. It can also be resolved how the cooling flow is suppressed from what the cooling flow hypothesis predicts, without any heating mechanism.},

	abstract = {A significant cosmological radio background will inevitably lead to a radio Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. In the simplest limit, the combined signal from the scattered radio and cosmic microwave background exhibits a null at around \${\textbackslash}nu {\textbackslash}simeq 735\$ MHz. Here, we show that kinematic and relativistic temperature corrections to this radio SZ signal are easily calculable. We treat both the cluster and observer motion, and the scattering of anisotropies in the radio background, highlighting how the spectrum of the radio SZ effect is affected in each case. Although relativistic temperature corrections only enter at the level of a few percent, our expressions allow high-precision modelling of these terms. By measuring the SZ signal around the radio null, one is in principle able to place constraints on the properties of a cosmological radio background. A combination with standard SZ measurements from large cluster samples could provide a promising avenue towards breaking degeneracies between different contributions. Stacking analyses can reduce the effect of kinematic corrections and dipolar anisotropies in the radio background, thereby providing a way to constrain the redshift dependence of the average radio background. Our qualitative discussion is meant to give an analytic understanding of the various effects and also motivate further studies with the aim to obtain quantitative forecasts of their observability. At this stage, a detection of the corrections seems rather futuristic, but the advent of large SZ and X-ray cluster samples could drastically improve our ability to disentangle various effects.},

Our aim is to study the velocity field of the galaxy cluster Abell 780, which is known for the powerful radio source Hydra A at its center and where a spectacular X-ray tail associated with the galaxy LEDA 87445 has been discovered. Our analysis is based on the new spectroscopic data for hundreds of galaxies obtained with the Italian Telescopio Nazionale \{{\textbackslash}em Galileo\} and the Very Large Telescope. We have constructed a redshift catalog of 623 galaxies and selected a sample of 126 cluster members. We analyze the internal structure of the cluster using a number of techniques. We estimate the mean redshift z=0.0545, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion sigmav about 800 km/s, and the dynamical mass M200 about 5.4 10E14 solar masses. The global properties of Abell 780 are typical of relaxed clusters. On a smaller scale, we can detect the presence of a galaxy group associated with LEDA 87445 in projected phase space. The mean velocity and position of the center of the group agree well with the velocity and position of LEDA 87445. We estimate the following parameters of the collision. The group is characterized by a higher velocity relative to the main system. It is infalling at a rest frame velocity of Vrf=+870 km/s and lies at a projected distance D=1.1 Mpc to the south, slightly southeast of the cluster center. The mass ratio between the group and the cluster is about 1:5. We also find evidence of an asymmetry in the velocity distribution of galaxies in the inner cluster region, which might be related to a small low-velocity group detected as a substructure at Vrf=-750 km/s. We conclude that A780, although dynamically relaxed at first sight, contains small substructures that may have some impact on the energetics of the core region.},

	abstract = {Clustering of inertial particles is important for many types of astrophysical and geophysical turbulence, but it has been studied predominately for incompressible flows. Here we study compressible flows and compare clustering in both compressively (irrotationally) and vortically (solenoidally) forced turbulence. Vortically and compressively forced flows are driven stochastically either by solenoidal waves or by circular expansion waves, respectively. For compressively forced flows, the power spectrum of the density of inertial particles is a useful tool for displaying particle clustering relative to the fluid density enhancement. Power spectra are shown to be particularly sensitive for studying large-scale particle clustering, while conventional tools such as radial distribution functions are more suitable for studying small-scale clustering. Our primary finding is that particle clustering through shock interaction is particularly prominent in turbulence driven by spherical expansion waves. It manifests itself through a double-peaked distribution of spectral power as a function of Stokes number. The two peaks are associated with two distinct clustering mechanisms; shock interaction for smaller Stokes numbers and the centrifugal sling effect for larger values. The clustering of inertial particles is associated with the formation of caustics. Such caustics can only be captured in the Lagrangian description, which allows us to assess the relative importance of caustics in vortically and compressively forced turbulence. We show that the statistical noise resulting from the limited number of particles in the Lagrangian description can be removed from the particle power spectra, allowing us a more detailed comparison of the residual spectra. We focus on the Epstein drag law relevant for rarefied gases, but show that our findings apply also to the usual Stokes drag.},

This \{{\textbackslash}bf might\} lead to significant systematic effects on cluster cosmological analyses for which only a single observable is generally used. From this pilot study, we conclude that the combination of high resolution SZ, X-ray and lensing data could allow us to identify and correct for these systematic effects. This would constitute a very interesting extension of the NIKA2 SZ Large Program.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07105},
	abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are the largest virialized objects in the Universe. Because mergers of these objects are the most energetic events in the Universe--driving shocks and turbulence that heat the gas and accelerate non-thermal phenomena in ways that are yet to be understood--they are inherently interesting. The galaxy cluster Abell 3395 is at an early stage merger containing two subclusters and is also connected to Abell 3391 via an intercluster filament. In this paper, we study the connection between Abell 3395 and the intercluster filament with NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku data. Since the NuSTAR observation is moderately contaminated by scattered light, we present a novel technique developed for disentangling this background from the intracluster medium emission. We find that the interface of the cluster and the intercluster filament does not show any signs of heated plasma, as was previously thought. This interface has low temperature, high density and low entropy, thus we suggest that the gas is cooling, being enhanced by the turbulent or tidal 'weather' driven during the early stage of the merger. Furthermore, our temperature results from the NuSTAR data are in agreement with that of XMM-Newton, and joint NuSTAR and XMM-Newton analysis for a region with {\textasciitilde}25\% scattered light contamination within 1 sigma. We show that the temperature constraint of the intracluster medium is valid even when the data is contaminated up to {\textasciitilde}25\% for {\textasciitilde}5 keV cluster emission.},

	abstract = {The potential of deep learning based image-to-image translations has recently drawn a lot of attention; one intriguing possibility is that of generating cosmological predictions with a drastic reduction in computational cost. Such an effort requires optimization of neural networks with loss functions beyond low-order statistics like pixel-wise mean square error, and validation of results beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. In order to study learning-based cosmological mappings, we choose a tractable analytical prescription - the Zel'dovich approximation - modeled using U-Net, a convolutional image translation framework. A comprehensive list of metrics is proposed, including higher-order correlation functions, conservation laws, topological indicators, dynamical robustness, and statistical independence of density fields. We find that the U-Net approach does well with some metrics but has difficulties with others. In addition to validating AI approaches using rigorous physical benchmarks, this study motivates advancements in domain-specific optimization schemes for scientific machine learning.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05185},
	abstract = {Galaxy clusters show a variety of intra-cluster medium properties at a fixed mass, among which gas fractions, X-ray luminosity and X-ray surface brightness. In this work we investigate whether the yet-undetermined cause producing clusters of X-ray low surface brightness also affects galaxy properties, namely richness, richness concentration, width and location of the red sequence, colour, luminosity, and dominance of the brightest cluster galaxy. We use SDSS-DR12 photometry and our analysis factors out the mass dependency to derive trends at fixed cluster mass. Clusters of low surface brightness for their mass have cluster richness in spite of their group-like luminosity. Gas-poor, low X-ray surface brightness, X-ray faint clusters for their mass, display 25{\textbackslash}\% lower richness for their mass at \$4.4{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level. Therefore, richness and quantities depending on gas, such as gas fraction, \$M\_\{gas\}\$, and X-ray surface brightness, are covariant at fixed halo mass. In particular, we do not confirm the hint of an anti-correlation of hot and cold baryons at fixed mass put forth in literature. All the remaining optical properties show no covariance at fixed mass, within the sensitivities allowed by our data and sample size. We conclude that X-ray and optical properties are disjoint, the optical properties not showing signatures of those processes involving gas content, apart from the richness-mass scaling relation. The covariance between X-ray surface brightness and richness is useful for an effective X-ray follow-up of low surface brightness clusters because it allows us to pre-select clusters using optical data of survey quality and prevent expensive X-ray observations.},

	abstract = {We present a deep machine learning (ML) approach to constraining cosmological parameters with multi-wavelength observations of galaxy clusters. The ML approach has two components: an encoder that builds a compressed representation of each galaxy cluster and a flexible CNN to estimate the cosmological model from a cluster sample. It is trained and tested on simulated cluster catalogs built from the Magneticum simulations. From the simulated catalogs, the ML method estimates the amplitude of matter fluctuations, sigma\_8, at approximately the expected theoretical limit. More importantly, the deep ML approach can be interpreted. We lay out three schemes for interpreting the ML technique: a leave-one-out method for assessing cluster importance, an average saliency for evaluating feature importance, and correlations in the terse layer for understanding whether an ML technique can be safely applied to observational data. These interpretation schemes led to the discovery of a previously unknown self-calibration mode for flux- and volume-limited cluster surveys. We describe this new mode, which uses the amplitude and peak of the cluster mass PDF as anchors for mass calibration. We introduce the term "overspecialized" to describe a common pitfall in astronomical applications of machine learning in which the ML method learns simulation-specific details, and we show how a carefully constructed architecture can be used to check for this source of systematic error.},

We measure the ICL fraction in four optical ACS/WFC filters (F435W, F475W, F606W, and F814W) and five infrared WFC3/IR bands (F105W, F110W, F125W, F140W, and F160W). The ICL maps are calculated using the free of a priori assumptions algorithm CICLE, and the cluster membership is estimated from photometric properties. We find optical ICL fractions that range between \${\textbackslash}sim\$6{\textbackslash}\% and 19{\textbackslash}\% in nice agreement with the values found in previous works for merging clusters. We also observe an ICL fraction excess between 3800 {\textbackslash}AA and 4800 {\textbackslash}AA, previously identified as a signature of merging clusters at \$0.18{\textless}z{\textless}0.55\$. This excess suggests the presence of an enhanced population of young/low-metallicity stars in the ICL. All indicators thus point to WHL J013719.8-08284 as a disturbed cluster with a significant amount of recently injected stars, bluer than the average stars hosted by the cluster members and likely stripped out from infalling galaxies during the current merging event. Infrared ICL fractions are \${\textbackslash}sim\$50{\textbackslash}\% higher than the optical ones, which could be signature of an older and/or higher-metallicity ICL population that can be associated with the build-up of the BCG, the passive evolution of young stars, previously injected, or preprocessing in infalling groups. Finally, investigating the photometry of the cluster members, we tentatively conclude that WHL J013719.8-08284 fulfills the expected conditions for a fossil system progenitor.},

For the data, we adopt the recently released galaxy group catalog (Y20: {\textbackslash}cite\{yang2020extended\}) with \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}6\$ robustly-identified groups, and construct various galaxy cluster samples for the kSZ measurement. The Y20 catalogue also provides estimation of halo mass, which further improves the kSZ measurement by \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}\%\$. For the analysis method, we derive an optimal estimator of pairwise kSZ through the maximum likelihood analysis. It also handles potential systematic errors self-consistently. The baseline cluster sample, containing the \$1.2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ richest galaxy clusters of typical mass {\textasciitilde}\$ 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}/h\$ at typical redshift \$0.2\$-\$0.5\$, rules out the null hypothesis at \$5{\textbackslash}sigma\$.

We perform various internal checks, with different cluster selection criteria, different sky coverage and redshift range, different CMB maps, different filter sizes, different treatments of potential systematics and the covariance matrix.

Using telescopes at the Canary Island observatories, we conducted the long-term observational program 128- MULTIPLE-16/15B (hereafter LP15), a large and complete optical follow-up campaign of all the unidentified PSZ2 sources in the northern sky, with declinations above \$-15{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ and no correspondence in the first Planck catalogue PSZ1. This paper is the third and last in the series of LP15 results, after Streblyanska et al. (2019) and Aguado-Barahona et al.

We complement these LP15 spectroscopic results with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) archival data and other observations from a previous program (ITP13-08), and present a catalog of 388 clusters and groups of galaxies including estimates of their velocity dispersion. The majority of them (356) are the optical counterpart of a PSZ2 source. A subset of 297 of those clusters is used to construct the \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SZ\}-M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm dyn\}\$ scaling relation, based on the estimated SZ mass from Planck measurements and our dynamical mass estimates. We discuss and correct for different statistical and physical biases in the estimation of the masses, such as the Eddington bias when estimating \$M\_\{SZ\}\$ and the aperture and the number of galaxies used to calculate \$M\_\{dyn\}\$. The SZ-to-dynamical mass ratio for those 297 PSZ2 clusters is \$(1-B) = 0.80{\textbackslash}pm0.04\$ (stat) \${\textbackslash}pm 0.05\$ (sys), with only marginal evidence for a possible mass dependence of this factor.

The unified picture that emerges from our analysis is that the main physical drivers shaping the distribution of matter at all scales are star formation-driven galactic outflows at \$z{\textgreater}2\$ for lower mass halos and AGN jets at \$z{\textless}2\$ in higher mass halos. Feedback suppresses the baryon mass function with time relative to the halo mass function, and it even impacts the halo mass function itself at the {\textasciitilde}20\% level, particularly evacuating the centres and enhancing dark matter just outside halos. At early epochs baryons pile up in the centres of halos, but by late epochs and particularly in massive systems gas has mostly been evacuated from within the inner halo. AGN jets are so efficient at such evacuation that at low redshifts the baryon fraction within \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ halos is only 25\% of the cosmic baryon fraction, mostly in stars.

As a result, 87\% of the baryonic mass in the Universe lies in the IGM at \$z=0\$, with 67\% being in the form of warm-hot IGM (\$T{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm K\$).},

This shift in our scientific approach requires us to consider whether we can trust the black box. Here, we overview methods for an often-overlooked step in the development of ML models: building community trust in the algorithms. Trust is an essential ingredient not just for creating more robust data analysis techniques, but also for building confidence within the astronomy community to embrace machine learning methods and results.},

	abstract = {NenuFAR, the New Extension in Nancay Upgrading LOFAR, is currently in its early science phase. It is in this context that the Cosmic Filaments and Magnetism Pilot Survey is observing sources with the array as it is still under construction - with 57 (56 core, 1 distant) out of a total planned 102 (96 core, 6 distant) mini-arrays online at the time of observation - to get a first look at the low-frequency sky with NenuFAR. One of its targets is the Coma galaxy cluster: a well-known object, host of the prototype radio halo. It also hosts other features of scientific import, including a radio relic, along with a bridge of emission connecting it with the halo. It is thus a well-studied object. In this paper, we show the first confirmed NenuFAR detection of the radio halo and radio relic of the Coma cluster at 34.4 MHz, with associated intrinsic flux density estimates: we find an integrated flux value of 106.3 +- 3.5 Jy for the radio halo, and 102.0 +- 7.4 Jy for the radio relic. These are upper bound values, as they do not include point-source subtraction. We also give an explanation of the technical difficulties encountered in reducing the data, along with steps taken to resolve them. This will be helpful for other scientific projects which will aim to make use of standalone NenuFAR imaging observations in the future.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01673},
	abstract = {Galaxy clusters have a triaxial matter distribution. The weak-lensing signal, an important part in cosmological studies, measures the projected mass of all matter along the line-of-sight, and therefore changes with the orientation of the cluster. Studies suggest that the shape of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the centre of the cluster traces the underlying halo shape, enabling a method to account for projection effects. We use 324 simulated clusters at four redshifts between 0.1 and 0.6 from `The Three Hundred Project' to quantify correlations between the orientation and shape of the BCG and the halo. We find that haloes and their embedded BCGs are aligned, with an average \${\textbackslash}sim\$20 degree angle between their major axes. The bias in weak lensing cluster mass estimates correlates with the orientation of both the halo and the BCG. Mimicking observations, we compute the projected shape of the BCG, as a measure of the BCG orientation, and find that it is most strongly correlated to the weak-lensing mass for relaxed clusters. We also test a 2-dimensional cluster relaxation proxy measured from BCG mass isocontours. The concentration of stellar mass in the projected BCG core compared to the total stellar mass provides an alternative proxy for the BCG orientation. We find that the concentration does not correlate to the weak-lensing mass bias, but does correlate with the true halo mass. These results indicate that the BCG shape and orientation for large samples of relaxed clusters can provide information to improve weak-lensing mass estimates.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11467},
	abstract = {Galaxy clusters grow by accreting galaxies from the field and along filaments of the cosmic web. As galaxies are accreted they are affected by their local environment before they enter (pre-processing), and traverse the cluster potential. Observations that aim to constrain pre-processing are challenging to interpret because filaments comprise a heterogeneous range of environments including groups of galaxies embedded within them and backsplash galaxies that contain a record of their previous passage through the cluster. This motivates using modern cosmological simulations to dissect the population of galaxies found in filaments that are feeding clusters, to better understand their history, and aid the interpretation of observations. We use zoom-in simulations from The ThreeHundred project to track halos through time and identify their environment. We establish a benchmark for galaxies in cluster infall regions that supports the reconstruction of the different modes of pre-processing. We find that up to 45\% of all galaxies fall into clusters via filaments (closer than 1Mpc/h from the filament spine). 12\% of these filament galaxies are long-established members of groups and between 30 and 60\% of filament galaxies at R200 are backsplash galaxies. This number depends on the cluster's dynamical state and sharply drops with distance. Backsplash galaxies return to clusters after deflecting widely from their entry trajectory, especially in relaxed clusters. They do not have a preferential location with respect to filaments and cannot collapse to form filaments. The remaining pristine galaxies (30 - 60\%) are environmentally effected by cosmic filaments alone.},

The linear sizes of the northern and southern relics are \${\textbackslash}sim0.3{\textasciitilde}\$Mpc and \${\textbackslash}sim1.2{\textasciitilde}\$Mpc, respectively, which is consistent with the theoretical expectation that a larger relic is produced in the less massive subcluster side. However, ZwCl1447.2+2619 is unlike other known double radio relic systems, where the larger relics are much more luminous by several factors. In this merger the higher surface brightness of the smaller northern relic makes its total radio luminosity comparable to that of the much larger southern relic. The surface brightness ratio \${\textbackslash}sim0.1\$ between the two radio relics differs significantly from the relation observed in other double radio relic systems. From our radio spectral analysis, we find that both relics signify similar weak shocks with Mach numbers of \$2.9{\textbackslash}pm0.8\$ and \$2.0{\textbackslash}pm0.7\$ for the northern and southern relics, respectively. Moreover, the northern relic is connected to a discrete radio source with an optical counterpart, which indicates the possible presence of cosmic ray injection and re-acceleration. Therefore, we propose that this atypical surface brightness ratio can be explained with the particle acceleration efficiency precipitously dropping in the weak shock regime and/or with re-acceleration of fossil cosmic rays. Our multi-wavelength analysis and numerical simulation suggest that ZwCl1447.2+2619 is a post-merger, which has experienced a near head-on collision \${\textbackslash}sim0.7{\textbackslash}rm{\textasciitilde}Gyr\$ ago.},

	abstract = {We carry out a systematic study of the recently discovered fundamental plane of galaxy clusters (CFP) using a sample of {\textasciitilde}250 simulated clusters from the 300th project, focusing on the stability of the plane against different temperature definitions and its dependence on the dynamical relaxation state of clusters. The CFP is characterised in the form of \$T {\textbackslash}propto M\_s{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha r\_s{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}beta\$, defined with the gas temperature (\$T\$) and the characteristic halo scale radius and mass (\$r\_s\$ and \$M\_s\$) assuming an NFW halo description. We explore two definitions of weighted temperatures, namely mass-weighted and spectroscopic-like temperatures, in three radial ranges: [0.1, 1.0]\$r\_\{200\}\$, [0.15,1.0]\$r\_\{500\}\$, and [50,500]\$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ kpc. We find that 300th clusters at \$z=0\$ lie on a thin plane whose parameters (\${\textbackslash}alpha, {\textbackslash}beta\$) and dispersion (0.015--0.030 dex) depend on the gas temperature definition. The CFP for mass-weighted temperatures is closer to the virial equilibrium expectation (\${\textbackslash}alpha=1, {\textbackslash}beta=-1\$) with a smaller dispersion. When gas temperatures are measured inside 500\$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ kpc, which is close to the median value of \$r\_s\$, the resulting CFP deviates the most from the virial expectation and shifts towards the similarity solution for a secondary infall model (\${\textbackslash}alpha=1.5, {\textbackslash}beta=-2\$). Independently of the temperature definition, we find that clusters at \$z=1\$ form a CFP similar to the virial expectation. At all epochs, the CFP remains well defined throughout the evolution of the cluster population. The CFP of relaxed clusters is always close to the virial expectation, with a milder evolution than for the unrelaxed case. We find that only systems formed over the last 4 Gyr have a CFP that is closer to the self-similar solution. All these findings are compatible with the CFP obtained for a CLASH subsample excluding the hottest clusters with \$T\_X{\textgreater}12\$ keV.},

The targets were selected from X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect surveys, and observed with both the {\textbackslash}textit\{XMM-Newton\} and {\textbackslash}textit\{Chandra\} satellites. For each cluster, a precise gas mass profile was extracted, from which the value of \$r\_\{500\}\$ could be estimated. This allows us to define consistent radial ranges over which the metallicity measurements can be compared. In general, the data are of sufficient quality to extract meaningful metallicity measurements in two radial bins, \$r{\textless}0.3r\_\{500\}\$ and \$0.3{\textless}r/r\_\{500\}{\textless}1.0\$. For the outer bin, the combined measurement for all ten clusters, \$Z/Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} = 0.21 {\textbackslash}pm 0.09\$, represents a substantial improvement in precision over previous results. This measurement is consistent with, but slightly lower than, the average metallicity of 0.315 Solar measured at intermediate-to-large radii in low-redshift clusters. Combining our new high-redshift data with the previous low-redshift results allows us to place the tightest constraints to date on models of the evolution of cluster metallicity at intermediate radii. Adopting a power law model of the form \$Z {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}left(1+z{\textbackslash}right){\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}gamma\$, we measure a slope \${\textbackslash}gamma = -0.5{\textasciicircum}\{+0.4\}\_\{-0.3\}\$, consistent with the majority of the enrichment of the ICM having occurred at very early times and before massive clusters formed, but leaving open the possibility that some additional enrichment in these regions may have occurred since a redshift of 2.},

This result is robust over the full range of cluster stellar masses and redshifts in the sample, indicating that BCGs are special up to a redshift of \$z=1.0\$. However, BCGs with a large separation from the center of the cluster are found to be consistent with being statistical extremes of the cluster member mass distribution.

This allows us to distribute image data between nodes and construct parts of grid space exactly when and where needed. The developed prototype easily handles image data terabytes in size, while generating visibilities at great throughput and accuracy.

We analyze the Mach number distribution in the Dianoga simulations of galaxy clusters performed with the SPH code GADGET-3. The simulations include the effects of radiative cooling, star formation, metal enrichment, supernova and active galactic nuclei feedback. A grid-based shock-finding algorithm is applied in post-processing to the outputs of the simulations. This procedure allows us to explore in detail the distribution of shocked cells and their strengths as a function of cluster mass, redshift and baryonic physics. We also pay special attention to the connection between shock waves and the cool-core/non-cool core (CC/NCC) state and the global dynamical status of the simulated clusters. In terms of general shock statistics, we obtain a broad agreement with previous works, with weak (low-Mach number) shocks filling most of the volume and processing most of the total thermal energy flux. As a function of cluster mass, we find that massive clusters seem more efficient in thermalising the IGM and tend to show larger external accretion shocks than less massive systems. We do not find any relevant difference between CC and NCC clusters. However, we find a mild dependence of the radial distribution of the shock Mach number on the cluster dynamical state, with disturbed systems showing stronger shocks than regular ones throughout the cluster volume.},

In this paper, we present an emulator for the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. The emulator is based on the baryonification model, containing seven free parameters that are connected to the gas profiles and stellar abundances in haloes. We show that with the baryonic emulator, we can not only recover the power spectra of hydro-dynamical simulations at sub-percent precision but also establish a connection between the baryonic suppression of the power spectrum and the gas and stellar fractions in haloes. This connection allows us to predict the expected deviation from a dark-matter-only power spectrum using measured X-ray gas fractions of galaxy groups and clusters. With these measurements, we constrain the suppression to exceed the percent-level at k = 0.1-0.4 h/Mpc and to reach a maximum of 20-28 percent at around k = 7 h/Mpc (68 percent confidence level). As a further step, we also perform a detailed parameter study and we present a minimum set of four baryonic parameters that are required to recover the scale and redshift dependence observed in hydro-dynamical simulations.

	abstract = {Speculations abound that several facets of fully developed turbulent flows are fractals. Although the earlier leading work of Mandelbrot (1974, 1975) suggests that these speculations, initiated largely by himself, are plausible, no effort has yet been made to put them on firmer ground by, resorting to actual measurements in turbulent shear flows. This work is an attempt at filling this gap. In particular, we examine the following questions: (a) Is the turbulent/non-turbulent interface a self-similar fractal, and (if so) what is its fractal dimension ? Does this quantity differ from one class of flows to another? (b) Are constant-property surfaces (such as the iso-velocity and iso-concentration surfaces) in fully developed flows fractals? What are their fractal dimensions? (c) Do dissipative structures in fully developed turbulence form a fractal set? What is the fractal dimension of this set? Answers to these questions (and others to be less fully discussed here) are interesting because they bring the theory of fractals closer to application to turbulence and shed new light on some classical problems in turbulence - for example, the growth of material lines in a turbulent environment. The other feature of this work is that it tries to quantify the seemingly complicated geometric aspects of turbulent flows, a feature that has not received its proper share of attention. The overwhelming conclusion of this work is that several aspects of turbulence can be described roughly by fractals, and that their fractal dimensions can be measured. However, it is not clear how (or whether), given the dimensions for several of its facets, one can solve (up to a useful accuracy) the inverse problem of reconstructing the original set (that is, the turbulent flow itself).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05673},
	abstract = {MeerKAT's large number of antennas, spanning 8 km with a densely packed 1 km core, create a powerful instrument for wide-area surveys, with high sensitivity over a wide range of angular scales. The MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS) is a programme of long-track MeerKAT L-band (900-1670 MHz) observations of 115 galaxy clusters, observed for \${\textbackslash}sim\$6-10 hours each in full polarisation. The first legacy product data release (DR1), made available with this paper, includes the MeerKAT visibilities, basic image cubes at \${\textbackslash}sim\$8" resolution, and enhanced spectral and polarisation image cubes at \${\textbackslash}sim\$8" and 15" resolutions. Typical sensitivities for the full-resolution MGCLS image products are \${\textbackslash}sim\$3-5 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}Jy/beam. The basic cubes are full-field and span 4 deg{\textasciicircum}2. The enhanced products consist of the inner 1.44 deg{\textasciicircum}2 field of view, corrected for the primary beam. The survey is fully sensitive to structures up to \${\textbackslash}sim\$10' scales and the wide bandwidth allows spectral and Faraday rotation mapping. HI mapping at 209 kHz resolution can be done at \$0{\textless}z{\textless}0.09\$ and \$0.19{\textless}z{\textless}0.48\$. In this paper, we provide an overview of the survey and DR1 products, including caveats for usage. We present some initial results from the survey, both for their intrinsic scientific value and to highlight the capabilities for further exploration with these data. These include a primary beam-corrected compact source catalogue of \${\textbackslash}sim\$626,000 sources for the full survey, and an optical/infrared cross-matched catalogue for compact sources in Abell 209 and Abell S295. We examine dust unbiased star-formation rates as a function of clustercentric radius in Abell 209 and present a catalogue of 99 diffuse cluster sources (56 are new), some of which have no suitable characterisation. We also highlight some of the radio galaxies which challenge current paradigms and present first results from HI studies of four targets.},

	abstract = {We present a strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster SDSS J1029+2623 at \$z=0.588\$, one of the few currently known lens clusters with multiple images of a background (\$z=2.1992\$) quasar with a measured time delay. We use archival Hubble Space Telescope multi-band imaging and new Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer follow-up spectroscopy to build an accurate lens mass model, a crucial step towards future cosmological applications. The spectroscopic data enable the secure identification of 57 cluster members and of two nearby perturbers along the line-of-sight. We estimate the inner kinematics of a sub-set of 20 cluster galaxies to calibrate the scaling relations parametrizing the sub-halo mass component. We also reliably determine the redshift of 4 multiply imaged sources, provide a tentative measurement for one system, and report the discovery of a new four-image system. The final catalog comprises 26 multiple images from 7 background sources, spanning a wide redshift range, from 1.02 to 5.06. We present two parametric lens models, with slightly different cluster mass parametrizations. The observed positions of the multiple images are accurately reproduced within approximately \$0''.2\$, the three image positions of the quasar within only \${\textbackslash}sim0''.1\$. We estimate a cluster projected total mass of \$M({\textless}300{\textasciitilde} \{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}) {\textbackslash}sim 2.1 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}{\textasciitilde} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, with a statistical uncertainty of a few percent. Both models, that include a small galaxy close to one of the quasar images, predict magnitude differences and time delays between the quasar images that are consistent with the observations.},

	abstract = {We present our determination of the baryon budget for an X-ray-selected XXL sample of 136 galaxy groups and clusters spanning nearly two orders of magnitude in mass (\$M\_\{500\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) and the redshift range \$0{\textless} z {\textless} 1\$. Our joint analysis is based on the combination of HSC-SSP weak-lensing mass measurements, XXL X-ray gas mass measurements, and HSC and SDSS multiband photometry. We carry out a Bayesian analysis of multivariate mass-scaling relations of gas mass, galaxy stellar mass, stellar mass of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), and soft-band X-ray luminosity, by taking into account the intrinsic covariance between cluster properties, selection effect, weak-lensing mass calibration, and observational error covariance matrix. The mass-dependent slope of the gas mass--total mass (\$M\_\{500\}\$) relation is found to be \$1.29\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.16\}\$, which is steeper than the self-similar prediction of unity, whereas the slope of the stellar mass--total mass relation is shallower than unity, \$0.85\_\{-0.09\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\$. The BCG stellar mass weakly depends on cluster mass with a slope of \$0.49\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\$. The baryon, gas mass, and stellar mass fractions as a function of \$M\_\{500\}\$ agree with the results from numerical simulations and previous observations. We successfully constrain the full intrinsic covariance of the baryonic contents. The BCG stellar mass shows the larger intrinsic scatter at a given halo total mass, followed in order by stellar mass and gas mass. We find a significant positive intrinsic correlation coefficient between total (and satellite) stellar mass and BCG stellar mass and no evidence for intrinsic correlation between gas mass and stellar mass. All the baryonic components show no redshift evolution.},

	title = {The unusually weak and exceptionally steep radio relic in {Abell} 2108},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09225},
	abstract = {Mergers between galaxy clusters often drive shocks into the intra cluster medium (ICM), the eﬀects of which are sometimes visible via temperature and density jumps in the X-ray, and via radio emission from relativistic particles energized by the shock’s passage. Abell 2108 was selected as a likely merger system through comparing the X-ray luminosity to the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal, where this cluster appeared highly X-ray underluminous. Follow up observations conﬁrmed it to be a merging low mass cluster featuring two distinct subclusters, both with a highly disturbed X-ray morphology. Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data in bands 2, 3 \& 4 (covering 120-750 MHz) show an extended radio feature resembling a radio relic, near the location of a temperature discontinuity in the X-rays. We measure a Mach number from the X-ray temperature jump (MX = 1.6 ± 0.2). Several characteristics of radio relics (location and morphology of extended radio emission) are found in Abell 2108, making this cluster one of the few low mass mergers (ML-M = 1.8 ± 0.4 × 1014 M ) likely hosting a radio relic. The radio spectrum is exceptionally steep (α = −2 at the lowest frequencies), and the radio power is very weak (P1.4 GHz = 1 × 1022 W Hz−1). To account for the shock/relic oﬀset, we propose a scenario in which the shock created the relic by re-accelerating a cloud of pre-existing relativistic electrons and then moved away, leaving behind a fading relic. The electron aging timescale derived from the high-frequency steepening in the relic spectrum is consistent with the shock travel time to the observed X-ray discontinuity. However, the lower ﬂux in GMRT band 4 data causing the steepening could be due to instrumental limitations, and deeper radio data are needed to constrain the spectral slope of the relic at high frequencies. A background cluster, 4 arcmin from the merger, may have contributed to the ROSAT and Planck signals, but SZ modeling shows that the merger system is still X-ray underluminous, supporting the use of this approach to identifying merger-disrupted clusters.},

	abstract = {We discuss, using simple analytical models and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, the origin and parameters of turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Any pre-existing tangled magnetic field must decay in a few hundred million years by generating gas motions even if the electric conductivity of the intracluster gas is high. We argue that turbulent motions can be maintained in the intracluster gas and its dynamo action can prevent such a decay and amplify a random seed magnetic field by a net factor of typically 104 in 5 Gyr. Three physically distinct regimes can be identified in the evolution of turbulence and magnetic field in galaxy clusters. First, the fluctuation dynamo will produce microgauss (μG)-strong, random magnetic fields during the epoch of cluster formation and major mergers. At this stage pervasive turbulent flows with rms velocity of about 300 km s−1 can be maintained at scales of 100–200 kpc. The magnetic field is intermittent, has a smaller scale of 20–30 kpc and average strength of 2 μG. Secondly, turbulence will decay after the end of the major merger epoch; we discuss the dynamics of the decaying turbulence and the behaviour of magnetic field in it. Magnetic field and turbulent speed undergo a power-law decay, decreasing by a factor of 2 during this stage, whereas their scales increase by about the same factor. Thirdly, smaller-mass subclusters and cluster galaxies will produce turbulent wakes where magnetic fields will be generated as well. Although the wakes plausibly occupy only a small fraction of the cluster volume, we show that their area-covering factor can be close to unity, and thus they can produce some of the signatures of turbulence along virtually all lines of sight. The latter could potentially allow one to reconcile the possibility of turbulence with ordered filamentary gas structures, as in the Perseus cluster. The turbulent speeds and magnetic fields in the wakes are estimated to be of the order of 300 km s−1 and 2 μG, respectively, whereas the turbulent scales are of the order of 200 kpc for wakes behind subclusters of a mass 3 × 1013 M⊙ and about 10 kpc in the galactic wakes. Magnetic field in the wakes is intermittent and has the scale of about 30 and 1 kpc in the subcluster and galactic wakes, respectively. Random Faraday rotation measure is estimated to be typically 100–200 rad m−2, in agreement with observations. We predict detectable polarization of synchrotron emission from cluster radio haloes at wavelengths 3–6 cm, if observed at sufficiently high resolution.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06940},
	abstract = {During their lifetime, galaxy clusters grow through the accretion of matter from the filaments of the large scale structure and from mergers with other clusters. These mergers release a large amount of energy into the intracluster medium (ICM) through merger shocks and turbulence. These phenomena are associated with the formation of radio sources known as radio relics and radio halos, respectively. Radio relics and halos are unique proxies to study the complex properties of these dynamically active regions of clusters and in general the micro physics of the ICM. Abell 3667 is a spectacular examples of a merging system hosting a large pair of radio relics. Due to its proximity (z=0.0553) and large mass, the system enables the study of these sources to a uniquely high level of detail. We observed Abell 3667 with MeerKAT as part of the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey. We used these data to study the large scale emission of the cluster, including its polarisation and spectral properties. We present the most detailed view of the radio relic system in Abell 3667 to date, with a resolution reaching 3 kpc. The relics are filled with a network of filaments with different spectral and polarisation properties that are likely associated with multiple regions of particle acceleration and local enhancements of the magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field in the space between filaments has strengths close to that expected in unperturbed regions at the same cluster-centric distance. Comparisons with MHD simulations supports the idea of filaments as multiple acceleration sites. Our observations also confirm the presence of an elongated radio halo, developed in the wake of the bullet-like sub-cluster that merged from the South-East. Finally, we associate the process of magnetic draping to a thin polarised radio source surrounding the remnant of the bullet's cool core.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07236},
	abstract = {The structure and star formation activity of a molecular cloud are fundamentally linked to its internal turbulence. However, accurately measuring the turbulent velocity dispersion is challenging due to projection effects and observational limitations, such as telescope resolution, particularly for clouds that include non-turbulent motions, such as large-scale rotation. Here we develop a new method to recover the three-dimensional (3D) turbulent velocity dispersion (\$\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_\{v,3D\}\$) from position-position-velocity (PPV) data. We simulate a rotating, turbulent, collapsing molecular cloud and compare its intrinsic \$\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_\{v,3D\}\$ with three different measures of the velocity dispersion accessible in PPV space: 1) the spatial mean of the 2nd-moment map, \$\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_i\$, 2) the standard deviation of the gradient/rotation-corrected 1st-moment map, \$\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_\{(c-grad)\}\$, and 3) a combination of 1) and 2), called the 'gradient-corrected parent velocity dispersion', \$\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_\{(p-grad)\}=(\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}{\textasciicircum}2\_i+\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}{\textasciicircum}2\_\{(c-grad)\}){\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}\$. We show that the gradient correction is crucial in order to recover purely turbulent motions of the cloud, independent of the orientation of the cloud with respect to the line of sight (LOS). We find that with a suitable correction factor and appropriate filters applied to the moment maps, all three statistics can be used to recover \$\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_\{v,3D\}\$, with method 3 being the most robust and reliable. We determine the correction factor as a function of the telescope beam size for different levels of cloud rotation, and find that for a beam FWHM \$f\$ and cloud radius \$R\$, the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion can best be recovered from the gradient-corrected parent velocity dispersion via \$\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_\{v,3D\}=[(-0.29{\textbackslash}pm0.26)f/R+1.93{\textbackslash}pm0.15]\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_\{(p-grad)\}\$ for \$f/R{\textless}1\$, independent of the level of cloud rotation or LOS orientation.},

The algorithms are tested by applying them to a simulated cluster data set. We illustrate the techniques by using them on a 50 ks Chandra observation of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Generated maps of the object showing abundances in eight different elements, absorbing column density, temperature, ionization time-scale and velocity are presented. Tests show that contour binning reproduces surface brightness considerably better than other methods.

	abstract = {Answers to the metal production of the Universe can be found in galaxy clusters, notably within their intra-cluster medium (ICM). The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) on board the next-generation European X-ray observatory {\textless}i{\textgreater}Athena{\textless}i/{\textgreater} (2030s) will provide the necessary leap forward in spatially-resolved spectroscopy required to disentangle the intricate mechanisms responsible for this chemical enrichment. In this paper, we investigate the future capabilities of the X-IFU in probing the hot gas within galaxy clusters. From a test sample of four clusters extracted from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we present comprehensive synthetic observations of these clusters at different redshifts (up to {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≤ 2) and within the scaled radius {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} performed using the instrument simulator SIXTE. Through 100 ks exposures, we demonstrate that the X-IFU will provide spatially resolved mapping of the ICM physical properties with little to no biases (⪅5\%) and well within statistical uncertainties. The detailed study of abundance profiles and abundance ratios within {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} also highlights the power of the X-IFU in providing constraints on the various enrichment models. From synthetic observations out to {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 2, we have also quantified its ability to track the chemical elements across cosmic time with excellent accuracy, and thereby to investigate the evolution of metal production mechanisms as well as the link to the stellar initial mass-function. Our study demonstrates the unprecedented capabilities of the X-IFU of unveiling the properties of the ICM but also stresses the data analysis challenges faced by future high-resolution X-ray missions such as {\textless}i{\textgreater}Athena{\textless}i/{\textgreater}.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06493},
	abstract = {We have developed a new software to perform the measurement of galaxy cluster pressure profiles from high angular resolution thermal SZ observations. The code allows the user to take into account various features of millimeter observations, such as point spread function (PSF) convolution, pipeline filtering, correlated residual noise, and point source contamination, in a forward modeling approach. One of the key advantages of the code is the possibility to use binned, non-parametric pressure profiles, enabling the detection of pressure features better than smooth functions such as the traditionally used generalized Navarro-Frenk-White profile. Another major upside is the performance of the software, enabling the extraction of the pressure profile and associated confidence intervals via MCMC sampling in times as short as a few minutes. We present the code and its validation on various realistic synthetic maps, of ideal spherical clusters, as well as of realistic, hydrodynamically simulated objects. We plan to publicly release the software in the coming months.},

	abstract = {We search for the signature of shocks in stacked gas pressure profiles of galaxy clusters using data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). Specifically, we stack the recently released Compton-y maps from the 2500 deg{\textasciicircum}2 SPT-SZ survey on the locations of clusters identified in that same dataset. The sample contains 516 clusters with mean mass {\textless}M200m{\textgreater} = 1e14.9 msol and redshift {\textless}z{\textgreater} = 0.55. We analyze in parallel a set of zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations from The Three Hundred project. The SPT-SZ data show two features: (i) a pressure deficit at R/R200m = \$1.08 {\textbackslash}pm 0.09\$, measured at \$3.1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance and not observed in the simulations, and; (ii) a sharp decrease in pressure at R/R200m = \$4.58 {\textbackslash}pm 1.24\$ at \$2.0{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance. The pressure deficit is qualitatively consistent with a shock-induced thermal non-equilibrium between electrons and ions, and the second feature is consistent with accretion shocks seen in previous studies. We split the cluster sample by redshift and mass, and find both features exist in all cases. There are also no significant differences in features along and across the cluster major axis, whose orientation roughly points towards filamentary structure. As a consistency test, we also analyze clusters from the Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter surveys and find quantitatively similar features in the pressure profiles. Finally, we compare the accretion shock radius (Rsh\_acc) with existing measurements of the splashback radius (Rsp) for SPT-SZ and constrain the lower limit of the ratio, Rsh\_acc/Rsp {\textgreater} \$2.16 {\textbackslash}pm 0.59\$.},

	abstract = {In the hierarchical scenario of structure formation, galaxy clusters are the ultimate virialised products in mass and time. Hot baryons in the intracluster medium (ICM) and cold baryons in galaxies inhabit a dark matter dominated halo. Internal processes, accretion, and mergers can perturb the equilibrium, which is established only at later times. However, the cosmic time when thermalisation is effective is still to be assessed. Here we show that massive clusters in the observed universe attained an advanced thermal equilibrium \${\textbackslash}sim{\textasciitilde}1.8{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{Gyr\}\$ ago, at redshift \$z =0.14{\textbackslash}pm0.06\$, when the universe was \$11.7{\textbackslash}pm0.7{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{Gyr\}\$ old. Hot gas is mostly thermalised after the time when cosmic densities of matter and dark energy match. We find in a statistically nearly complete and homogeneous sample of 120 clusters from the \{{\textbackslash}it Planck\} Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample that the kinetic energy traced by the galaxy velocity dispersion is a faithful probe of the gravitational energy since a look back time of at least \${\textbackslash}sim5.4{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{Gyr\}\$, whereas the efficiency of hot gas in converting kinetic to thermal energy, as measured through X-ray observations in the core-excised area within \$r\_\{500\}\$, steadily increases with time. The evolution is detected at the \${\textbackslash}sim 98\$ per cent probability level. Our results demonstrate that halo mass accretion history plays a larger role for cluster thermal equilibrium than radiative physics. The evolution of hot gas is strictly connected to the cosmic structure formation.},

We run the cluster on three resolution levels (1X, 10X, 25X), starting with an effective mass resolution of \$2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, subsequently increasing the particle number to reach \$4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}6M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. The maximum spatial resolution obtained in the simulations is limited by the gravitational softening reaching \${\textbackslash}epsilon=1.0\$ kpc at the highest resolution level, allowing to resolve the hierarchical assembly of the structures in very fine detail. All simulations presented, have been carried out with the SPMHD-code Gadget-3 with a heavily updated SPMHD prescription. The primary focus is to investigate magnetic field amplification in the Intracluster Medium (ICM). We show that the main amplification mechanism is the small scale-turbulent-dynamo in the limit of reconnection diffusion. In our two highest resolution models we start to resolve the magnetic field amplification driven by this process and we explicitly quantify this with the magnetic power-spectra and the magnetic tension that limits the bending of the magnetic field lines consistent with dynamo theory. Furthermore, we investigate the \${\textbackslash}nabla {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}mathbf\{B\}=0\$ constraint within our simulations and show that we achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art AMR or moving-mesh techniques, used in codes such as Enzo and Arepo. Our results show for the first time in a fully cosmological simulation of a galaxy cluster that dynamo action can be resolved in the framework of a modern Lagrangian magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) method, a study that is currently missing in the literature.},

It is an improved version of what we previously proposed in 1991. The transformation x=φ(t) is such that it maps the interval (0,∞) onto (−∞,∞), and that, while the integrand after the transformation decreases double exponentially at large negative t, the points of the formula approaches to zeros of sinωx or cosωx double exponentially at large positive t. Then the trapezoidal formula with an equal mesh size is applied to the integral over (−∞,∞) after the transformation, which gives an efficient quadrature formula for the Fourier-type integrals. The present transformation is improved in the sense that it can integrate a function f(z) with singularities in the finite z-plane more efficiently than the one previously proposed.},

The SPT cluster catalogue counts 677 cluster candidates up to redshift 1.7, it is a nearly mass limited sample, an ideal benchmark to test cluster evolution. We developed a pipeline to first separate the cluster signal from the background and foreground components and then jointly fit a parametric profile model on a combination of Planck and SPT data.

	abstract = {Determining the origin of turbulence in galaxy clusters, and quantifying its transport of heat, is an outstanding problem, with implications for our understanding of their thermodynamic history and structure. As the dilute plasma of the intracluster medium (ICM) is magnetized, heat and momentum travel preferentially along magnetic field lines. This anisotropy triggers a class of buoyancy instabilities that destabilize the ICM, and whose turbulent motions can augment or impede heat transport. We focus on the magneto-thermal instability (MTI), which may be active in the periphery of galaxy clusters. We aim to take a fresh look at the problem and construct a general theory that explains the MTI saturation mechanism and provides scalings and estimates for the turbulent kinetic energy, magnetic energy, and heat flux. We simulate MTI turbulence with a Boussinesq code, SNOOPY, which, in contrast to previous work, allows us to perform an extensive sampling of the parameter space. In two dimensions the saturation mechanism involves an inverse cascade carrying kinetic energy from the short MTI injection scales to larger scales, where it is arrested by the stable entropy stratification; at a characteristic "buoyancy scale", the energy is dumped into large-scale g-modes, which subsequently dissipate. Consequently, the entropy stratification sets an upper limit on the size and strength of turbulent eddies. Meanwhile, the MTI conveys a substantial fraction of heat, despite the tangled geometry of the magnetic field. In a companion paper, these results are extended to three-dimensional flows, and compared to real cluster observations.},

	abstract = {Observations indicate that turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) is supersonic (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turb\}{\textbackslash}gg1\$) and strongly magnetized (\${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}sim0.01-1\$), while in the intracluster medium (ICM) it is subsonic (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turb\}{\textbackslash}lesssim1\$) and weakly magnetized (\${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}sim100\$). Here, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turb\}\$ is the turbulent Mach number and \${\textbackslash}beta\$ is the plasma beta. We study the properties of shocks induced in these disparate environments, including the distribution of the shock Mach number, \$M\_s\$, and the dissipation of the turbulent energy at shocks, through numerical simulations using a high-order accurate code based on the WENO scheme. In particular, we investigate the effects of different modes of the forcing that drives turbulence: solenoidal, compressive, and a mixture of the two. In the ISM turbulence, while the density distribution looks different with different forcings, the velocity power spectrum, \$P\_v\$, on small scales exhibits only weak dependence. Hence, the statistics of shocks depend weakly on forcing either. In the ISM models with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turb\}{\textbackslash}approx10\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}sim0.1\$, the fraction of the turbulent energy dissipated at shocks is estimated to be \${\textbackslash}sim15{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}\%\$, not sensitive to the forcing mode. In contrast, in the ICM turbulence, \$P\_v\$ as well as the density distribution show strong dependence on forcing. The frequency and average Mach number of shocks are greater for compressive forcing than for solenoidal forcing, so is the energy dissipation. The fraction of ensuing shock dissipation is in the range of \${\textbackslash}sim10-35{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}\%\$ in the ICM models with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm turb\}{\textbackslash}approx0.5\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}6\$.

	abstract = {The Planck Collaboration has shown that the number of clusters as a function of their mass and redshift is an extremely powerful tool for cosmological analyses. However, the true cluster mass is not directly measurable. Among the possible approaches, clusters mass could be related to different observables via self similar scaling law. These observables are related to the baryonic components of which a cluster is composed. However, the theoretical relations that allow the use of these proxies often are affected by observational and physical biases, which impacts on the determination of the cluster mass. Fortunately, cosmological simulations are an extremely powerful tool to assess these problems. We present our calibration of the scaling relation between mass and velocity dispersion of galaxy members from the study of the simulated clusters of {\textbackslash}THP\{\} project with mass above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. In order to investigate the presence of a redshift dependence, we analyzed 16 different redshifts between \$z = 0\$ and \$z = 2\$. Finally, we investigated the impact of different AGN feedback models.},

In addition, the CLASH dataset includes lensing convergence maps that can be converted into lensing estimates of the total mass of the cluster. One-dimensional mass profiles are used to derive integrated mass estimates accounting for systematic effects (data processing, modeling, etc.). Two-dimensional analysis of the maps can reveal substructures in the cluster and, therefore, inform us about the dynamical state of each system. Moreover, we are able to study the hydrostatic mass to lensing mass bias, across different morphology and a range of redshift clusters to give more insight on the hydrostatic mass bias.

CL J1226.9+3332 is a massive and high redshift (z = 0.888) cluster that has already been observed at several wavelengths. A joint analysis of the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect at millimeter wavelength with the NIKA2 camera and in X-ray with the XMM-Newton satellite permits the reconstruction of the cluster thermodynamical properties and mass assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. We test the robustness of our mass estimates against different definitions of the data analysis transfer function. Using convergence maps reconstructed from the data of the CLASH program we obtain estimates of the lensing mass, which we compare to the estimated hydrostatic mass. This allows us to measure the hydrostatic-to-lensing mass bias and the associated systematic effects related to the NIKA2 measurement. We obtain M500HSE = (7.65 +- 1.03) 1014 Msun and M500lens = (7.35 +- 0.65) 1014 Msun, which implies a HSE-to-lensing bias consistent with 0 within 20 percent.},

	abstract = {One of the key elements needed to perform the cosmological exploitation of a cluster survey is the relation between the survey observable and the cluster masses.

The calibration of the relation between the Compton parameter \$Y\_\{500\}\$ and the mass \$M\_\{500\}\$ enclosed within radius \$R\_\{500\}\$ is one of the scientific goals of the NIKA2 SZ Large Program (LPSZ). We present an ongoing study to forecast the constraining power of this program, using mock simulated datasets that mimic the large program sample, selection function, and typical uncertainties on \$Y\_\{500\}\$ and \$M\_\{500\}\$. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling that enables taking into account a large panel of systematic effects. Our results show that the LPSZ can yield unbiased estimates of the scaling relation parameters for realistic input parameter values. The relative uncertainties on these parameters is \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the intercept and slope of the scaling relation, and \${\textbackslash}sim 34{\textbackslash}\%\$ for its intrinsic scatter, foreshadowing precise estimates to be delivered by the LPSZ.},

We show that using the cosmological information of the tSZ on top of the primordial CMB one contained in SPT data bring more constraints on cosmological parameters.

	abstract = {The most massive halos of matter in the Universe grow via accretion and merger events throughout cosmic times. These violent processes generate shocks at many scales and induce large-scale bulk and turbulent motions. These processes inject kinetic energy at large scales, which is transported to the viscous dissipation scales, contributing to the overall heating and virialisation of the halo, and acting as a source of non-thermal pressure in the intra-cluster medium. Characterizing the physical properties of these gas motions will help us to better understand the assembly of massive halos, hence the formation and the evolution of these large-scale structures. We base this characterization on the study of the X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect brightness fluctuations. Our work relies on three complementary samples covering a wide range of redshifts, masses and dynamical states of clusters. We present the results of our X-ray analysis for the low redshift sample, X-COP, and a subsample of higher redshift clusters. We investigate the derived properties according to the dynamical state of our clusters, and the possibility of a self-similar behaviour based on the reconstructed gas motions power-spectra and the correlation with various morphological indicators.},

	abstract = {The gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters is a convenient tool to use in the context of cosmological studies. Indeed this quantity allows to constrain the universal baryon fraction \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b/{\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$, as well as other parameters like the matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$, the Hubble parameter \$h\$ or the Equation of State of Dark Energy \$w\$. This gas mass fraction is also sensitive to baryonic effects that need to be taken into account, and that translate into nuisance parameters. Two of them are the depletion factor \${\textbackslash}Upsilon\$, and the hydrostatic mass bias \$B = (1 - b)\$. The first one describes how baryons are depleted in clusters with respect to the universal baryon fraction, while the other encodes the bias coming from the fact that the mass is deduced from X-ray observations under the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium. We will show preliminary results, obtained using the \{{\textbackslash}it Planck\}-ESZ clusters observed by XMM-\{{\textbackslash}it Newton\}, on both cosmological and cluster parameters. We will notably discuss the investigation on a possible redshift dependence of the mass bias, which is considered to be non-existent in hydrodynamic simulations based on \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$-CDM, and compare our results with other studies.},

We calculate that relation in the mass range going from dwarf galaxies to cluster of galaxies. This was done thanks to a modeling of energy transfer via SN and AGN feedback, as well as via dynamical friction of baryon clumps. We show that, in the mass range above galaxy masses (Groups and clusters), the inner slope-mass relation changes its trend. It flattens (towards less cuspy profile) around masses corresponding to groups of galaxies and steepens again for large galaxy cluster masses. The flattening is produced by the AGN outflows (AGN feedback). The one-\$ {\textbackslash}sigma\$ scatter on \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ is approximately constant in all the mass range (\${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}simeq 0.3\$). This is the first paper extending the inner density profile slope-mass relationship to clusters of galaxies, accounting for the role of baryons.

	abstract = {The lack of adequate X-ray observing capability is seriously impeding the progress in understanding the hot phase of circumgalactic medium (CGM), which is predicted to extend to the virial radius of a galaxy or beyond, and thus in acquiring key boundary conditions for studying galaxy evolution. To this end, the Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor ({\textbackslash}textit\{HUBS\}) is proposed. {\textbackslash}textit\{HUBS\} is designed to probe hot CGM by detecting its emission or absorption lines with a non-dispersive X-ray spectrometer of high resolution and high throughput. The spectrometer consists of a \$60{\textbackslash}times60\$ array of microcalorimeters, with each detector providing an energy resolution of \$2{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eV\}\$, and is placed in the focal plane of an X-ray telescope of \$1{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ field-of-view. With such a design, the spectrometer is also expected to enable studies of intra-group medium (IGrM) and the outer region of intra-cluster medium (ICM). To assess the scientific potential of {\textbackslash}textit\{HUBS\}, we created mock observations of galaxies, groups, and clusters at different redshifts with the {\textbackslash}tng simulation. Focusing exclusively on emission studies in this work, we took into account the effects of light cone, Galactic foreground emission, and background AGN contribution in the mock observations. From the observations, we made mock X-ray images and spectra, analyzed them to derive the properties of the emitting gas in each case, and compared the results with the input parameters from the simulation. The results show that {\textbackslash}textit\{HUBS\} is well suited for studying hot CGM at low redshifts. The redshift range is significantly extended for measuring IGrM and ICM.},

	abstract = {We present new LOFAR observations of the massive merging galaxy cluster MACS J0717.5+3745. The cluster hosts the most powerful radio halo known to date. These new observations, in combination with published uGMRT (300\$-\$850 MHz) and VLA (1\$-\$6.5 GHz) data, reveal that the halo is more extended than previously thought, with a largest linear size of \${\textbackslash}sim2.2 {\textbackslash}rm Mpc\$. The halo shows a steep spectrum (\${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{144{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{MHz\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{1.5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{GHz\}\}{\textbackslash}sim-1.4\$) and a steepening (\${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{1.5 {\textbackslash}text\{GHz\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{5.5 {\textbackslash}text\{GHz\}\}{\textbackslash}sim-1.9\$) above 1.5 GHz. We find a strong scattering in spectral index maps on scales of 50\$-\$100 kpc. We suggest that such a strong scattering may be a consequence of the regime where inverse Compton dominate the energy losses of electrons. The spectral index becomes steeper and shows an increased curvature in the outermost regions of the halo. We combined the radio data with {\textbackslash}textit\{Chandra\} observations to investigate the connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of the intracluster medium (ICM). Despite a significant substructure in the halo emission, the radio brightness correlates strongly with the X-ray brightness at all observed frequencies. The radio-versus-X-ray brightness correlation slope steepens at a higher radio frequency (from \$b\_\{144 {\textbackslash}text\{MHz\}\}=0.67{\textbackslash}pm0.05\$ to \$b\_\{3.0 {\textbackslash}text\{GHz\}\}=0.98{\textbackslash}pm0.09\$) and the spectral index shows a significant anti correlation with the X-ray brightness. Both pieces of evidence further support a spectral steepening in the external regions. The compelling evidence for a steep spectral index, the existence of a spectral break above 1.5 GHz, and the dependence of radio and X-ray surface brightness correlation on frequency are interpreted in the context of turbulent reacceleration models. Under this scenario, our results allowed us to constrain that the turbulent kinetic pressure of the ICM is up to 10\%.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of evaluating the power spectrum of the velocity field of the intracluster medium using only information on the plasma density fluctuations, which can be measured today by Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories. We argue that for relaxed clusters there is a linear relation between the rms density and velocity fluctuations across a range of scales, from the largest ones, where motions are dominated by buoyancy, down to small, turbulent scales: , where δρ k /ρ is the spectral amplitude of the density perturbations at wavenumber k, is the mean square component of the velocity field, cs is the sound speed, and η1 is a dimensionless constant of the order of unity. Using cosmological simulations of relaxed galaxy clusters, we calibrate this relation and find η1 ≈ 1 ± 0.3. We argue that this value is set at large scales by buoyancy physics, while at small scales the density and velocity power spectra are proportional because the former are a passive scalar advected by the latter. This opens an interesting possibility to use gas density power spectra as a proxy for the velocity power spectra in relaxed clusters across a wide range of scales.},

	abstract = {The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS) executed during the performance verification phase of the Spectrum- Roentgen-Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA telescope was completed in November 2019. One of the science goals of this survey is to demonstrate the ability of eROSITA to detect samples of clusters and groups at the final depth of the eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Due to the sizeable point-spread function of eROSITA, high redshift clusters of galaxies or compact nearby groups hosting bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be misclassified as point sources by the source detection algorithms. A total of 357 galaxy clusters and groups were identified based on their red sequence in the eFEDS point source catalog. In this work, we examine the multi-wavelength properties of these clusters and groups to understand the potential biases in our selection process and the completeness of the extent-selected sample. We find that the majority of the clusters and groups in the point source sample are indeed under-luminous and compact compared to the extent-selected sample. Their faint X-ray emission, well under the flux limit of the extent-selected eFEDS clusters, and their compact X-ray emission are likely to be the main reason behind this misclassification. In the sample, we confirm that 11\% of the sources host AGN in their brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). By studying their X-ray, optical, and infrared, and radio properties, we establish a method to identify the most extraordinary clusters and groups that host AGNs in their BCGs. We test this method through the SDSS optical spectroscopy successfully on the current point source catalog and find four low mass clusters and groups with active radio-loud AGNs. The method we developed will be used to identify high redshift clusters and AGN dominated groups and low mass clusters misclassified in the future eROSITA All-Sky Survey point source catalogs.},

We extract X-ray observables (Lx, Lbol, T, Mgas, Yx) within R500 for the sample of 542 clusters in the eFEDS field. By applying detection and extent likelihoods, we construct a subsample of 265 clusters with a contamination level of {\textless}10\% (including AGNs and spurious fluctuations) to be utilized in the scaling relation analysis. The selection function based on the state-of-the-art simulations of the eROSITA sky is fully accounted for in our work. We provide the X-ray observables in the core-included {\textless}R500 and core-excised 0.15*R500-R500 apertures for 542 galaxy clusters and groups detected in the eFEDS field. Additionally, we present our best-fit results for the normalization, slope, redshift evolution and intrinsic scatter parameters of the X-ray scaling relations between Lx-T, Lx-Mgas, Lx-Yx, Lbol-T, Lbol-Mgas, Lbol-Yx and Mgas-T. We find that the best-fit slopes significantly deviate from the self-similar model at a {\textgreater}3sigma confidence level however, our results are in good agreement with the simulations including non-gravitational physics and the recent results that take into account selection effects. Strong deviations we find from the self-similar scenario indicate that the non-gravitational effects play an important role in shaping the observed physical state of clusters. This work extends the scaling relations to low mass, low luminosity galaxy cluster and group regime using eFEDS observations, demonstrating eROSITA's ability to measure ICM emission out to R500 with survey-depth exposures and constrain the scaling relations in a wide mass-luminosity-redshift range.},

Contributions to the cooling rate by the individual elements are given, to allow for the creation of cooling curves tailored to speciﬁc abundance requirements. In some situations, it is important to be able to include radiative losses in the hydrodynamics. The enhanced compression ratio can trigger instabilities (such as the Vishniac thin-shell instability) that would otherwise be absent. For gas with temperatures below 104 K, the cooling time becomes very long and does not aﬀect the gas on the timescales that are generally of interest for hydrodynamical simulations of circumstellar plasmas. However, above this temperature, a signiﬁcant fraction of the elements is ionised, and the cooling rate increases by a factor 1000 relative to lower temperature plasmas.},

These data provide an order-of-magnitude improvement in depth and/or angular resolution over previous observations at X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths. We find that the one-dimensional temperature and entropy profiles are consistent with expectations for pure-cooling models. In particular, the entropy profile is well fit by a single power law at all radii, with no evidence for excess entropy in the core. In the inner ∼10 kpc, the cooling time is shorter than any other known cluster by an order of magnitude, while the ratio of the cooling time to freefall time (tcool/tff) approaches unity, signaling that the intracluster medium is unable to resist multiphase condensation on kpc scales. The bulk of the cooling in the inner ∼20 kpc is confined to a low-entropy filament extending northward from the central galaxy, with tcool/tff ∼ 1 over the length of the filament. In this filament, we find evidence for ∼1010 M⊙ in cool (∼104 K) gas (as traced by the [O ii]λλ3726,3729 doublet), which is coincident with the low-entropy filament and absorbing soft X-rays. The bulk of this cool gas is draped around and behind a pair of X-ray cavities, presumably bubbles that have been inflated by radio jets. These data support a picture in which active galactic nucleus feedback is promoting the formation of a multiphase medium via uplift of low-entropy gas, either via ordered or chaotic (turbulent) motions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07326},
	abstract = {The use of galaxy clusters as cosmological probes often relies on understanding the properties and evolution of the intracluster medium (ICM). However, the ICM is a complex plasma, regularly stirred by mergers and feedback, with non-negligible bulk and turbulent motions and a non-thermal pressure component, making it difficult to construct a coherent and comprehensive picture. To this end, we use the FABLE simulations to investigate how the hydrostatic mass bias is affected by cluster dynamical state, mergers, AGN feedback and turbulence. Following in detail a single, massive cluster we find the bias varies significantly over cosmic time, rarely staying at the average value found at a particular epoch. Variations of the bias at a given radius are contemporaneous with periods where outflows dominate the mass flux, either due to mergers or AGN feedback. The \$z=0\$ ensemble median mass bias in FABLE is \${\textbackslash}sim13\$ per cent at \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{500\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim15\$ per cent at \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{200\}\$, but with a large scatter in individual values. In halo centres, we see an increase in temperature and a decrease in non-thermal pressure support with cosmic time as turbulence thermalises, leading to a reduction in the mass bias within \${\textbackslash}sim0.2 R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{200\}\$. When using a fitted pressure profile, instead of the `raw' simulation data, to estimate the bias, we find there can be significant differences, particularly at larger radii and higher redshift. We therefore caution over the use of such fits in future work with the next generation of X-ray and SZ observations.},

A star-bursting compact group, the Blue Infalling Group (BIG), is plunging into the nearby cluster A1367. Previous optical observations reveal rich tidal features in the BIG members, and a long H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ trail behind. Here we report the discovery of a projected \${\textbackslash}sim 250\$ kpc X-ray tail behind the BIG using Chandra and XMM-Newton observations.

The temperature along the tail is \${\textbackslash}sim 1\$ keV, but the apparent metallicity is very low, an indication of the multi-\$T\$ nature of the gas. The X-ray and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ surface brightnesses in the front part of the BIG tail follow the tight correlation established from a sample of stripped tails in nearby clusters, which suggests the multiphase gas originates from the mixing of the stripped interstellar medium (ISM) with the hot intracluster medium (ICM). Because thermal conduction and hydrodynamic instabilities are significantly suppressed, the stripped ISM can be long lived and produce ICM clumps. The BIG provides us a rare laboratory to study galaxy transformation and preprocessing.},

It covers an area of 140 square degrees where 542 galaxy clusters have been detected out to a redshift of 1.3. The eFEDS field is partly embedded in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) S19A data release, which covers 510 square degrees, containing approximately 36 million galaxies. This galaxy catalogue is used to construct a sample of 180 shear-selected galaxy clusters. In the common area to both surveys, about 90 square degrees, we investigate the effects of selection methods in the galaxy cluster detection by comparing the X-ray selected, eFEDS, and the shear-selected, HSC-SSP S19A, galaxy cluster samples. There are 25 shear-selected clusters in the eFEDS footprint. The relation between X-ray bolometric luminosity and weak-lensing mass is investigated, and it is found that the normalization of the bolometric luminosity and mass relation of the X-ray selected and shear-selected samples is consistent within \$1{\textbackslash}sigma\$. Moreover, we found that the dynamical state and merger fraction of the shear-selected clusters is not different from the X-ray selected ones. Four shear-selected clusters are undetected in X-rays. A close inspection reveals that one is the result of projection effects, while the other three have an X-ray flux below the ultimate eROSITA detection limit. Finally, 43\% of the shear-selected clusters lie in superclusters. Our results indicate that the scaling relation between X-ray bolometric luminosity and true cluster mass of the shear-selected cluster sample is consistent with the eFEDS sample. There is no significant population of X-ray underluminous clusters, indicating that X-ray selected cluster samples are complete and can be used as an accurate cosmological probe.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02231},
	abstract = {(Abridged) We explored 18 clusters from LoCuSS at z{\textasciitilde}0.2 with ACReS spectra of {\textasciitilde}1800 cluster members at R{\textless}R200 in a mass-complete sample. The metallicities of SF cluster galaxies with R{\textless}R200 were found to be enhanced with respect to the MZR of coeval field SF galaxies. This metallicity enhancement is limited to lower-mass satellites of the 9 clusters with a passive BCG. Many of the SF galaxies with enhanced metallicities are found in the core regions of the phase-space diagram expected for virialized populations. We find a higher fraction of higher mass SF galaxies at R{\textless}R500 in clusters with active BCGs compared to clusters with passive BCGs, a signal for galactic conformity. In contrast, much higher fractions of AGNs and especially recently quenched galaxies (RQGs) at R{\textless}R500 are found in clusters with passive BCGs in comparison to clusters with active BCGs. We deduce that strangulation is initiated in clusters with passive BCGs when SF satellite galaxies pass R200, by stopping the pristine gas inflow which would otherwise dilute the ISM and would maintain their metallicities at values similar to those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. For galaxies with higher masses which survived to be SF when travelling to R{\textless}R500 of clusters with passive BCGs, we assume that they suffer a rapid quenching of star formation, likely due to AGNs triggered by the increasing RPS toward the cluster center, which can compress the gas and fuel AGNs; these AGNs can rapidly quench and maintain quenched satellite galaxies. On the other hand, we found that surviving SF massive satellite galaxies around active BCGs are less affected by environment when they enter R{\textless}R500, since we observe R{\textless}R500 SF galaxies with higher masses and with metallicities typical of coeval field galaxies. This observed galactic conformity implies that active BCGs must maintain their activity over timescales of at least {\textasciitilde}1Gyr.},

The algorithm uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) in the form of a convolutional neural network and is trained with SZ maps generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Our method can reproduce the details of the aspherical turbulent galaxy clusters with a resolution similar to hydrodynamic simulations while achieving the computational feasibility of semi-analytical maps, allowing us to generate over \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ mock SZ maps in 30 seconds on a laptop. We show that the individual images generated by the model are novel clusters (i.e. not found in the training set) and that the model accurately reproduces the effects of mass and mass accretion rate on the SZ images, such as scatter, asymmetry, and concentration, in addition to modeling merging sub-clusters. This work demonstrates the viability of machine-learning--based methods for producing the number of realistic, high-resolution maps of galaxy clusters necessary to achieve statistical constraints from future SZ surveys.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02228},
	abstract = {Modern weak-lensing observations are becoming increasingly sensitive to baryonic feedback processes which are still poorly understood. So far, this new challenge has been faced either by imposing scale-cuts in the data or by modelling baryonic effects with simple, one-parameter models. In this paper, we rely on a more general, seven-parameter prescription of baryonic feedback effects, which is primarily motivated by observations and has been shown to agree with a plethora of hydrodynamical simulations. By combining weak-lensing data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) with observations of gas around galaxy groups and clusters, we are able to constrain our baryonic model parameters and learn more about feedback and cosmology. In particular, we use galaxy cluster gas (and stellar) fractions from a combination of X-ray data as well as stacked gas profiles measured by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect to provide evidence for baryonic feedback that is stronger than predicted by most hydrodynamical simulations. In terms of the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum, we report a beyond-percent effect at wave-modes above \$k{\textbackslash}sim 0.1-0.4\$ h/Mpc and a maximum suppression of 15-35 percent at \$k{\textgreater}5\$ h/Mpc (68 percent CL). Regarding the cosmological clustering strength, parametrised by the combined parameter \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_8={\textbackslash}sigma\_8({\textbackslash}Omega\_m/0.3){\textasciicircum}\{0.58\}\$, we find the known tension with the Planck satellite data to be reduced from 3.8 to 3.2 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ once baryonic effects are fully included in the analysis pipeline. The tension is further decreased to 2.8 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ when the weak-lensing data is combined with observations from X-ray and the kSZ effect. We conclude that, while baryonic feedback effects become more important in modern weak-lensing surveys, they can be excluded as the primary culprit for the observed \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_8\$-tension.},

	title = {Deep {Chandra} observations of merging galaxy cluster {ZwCl} 2341+0000},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02094},
	abstract = {Knowledge of X-ray shock and radio relic connection in merging galaxy clusters has been greatly extended in terms of both observation and theory over the last decade. ZwCl 2341+0000 is a double-relic merging galaxy cluster; previous studies have shown that half of the S relic is associated with an X-ray surface brightness discontinuity, while the other half not. The discontinuity was believed to be a shock front. Therefore, it is a mysterious case of an only partial shock-relic connection. By using the 206.5 ks deep Chandra observations, we aim to investigate the nature of the S discontinuity. Meanwhile, we aim to explore new morphological and thermodynamical features. In addition, we utilize the GMRT and JVLA images to compute radio spectral index (SI) maps. In the deep observations, the previously reported S surface brightness discontinuity is better described as a sharp change in slope or as a kink, which is likely contributed by the disrupted core of the S subcluster. The radio SI maps show spectral flattening at the SE edge of the S relic, suggesting that the location of the shock front is 640 kpc away from the kink. We update the radio shock Mach number to be \$2.2{\textbackslash}pm0.1\$ and \$2.4{\textbackslash}pm0.4\$ for the S and N radio relics, respectively, based on the injection SI. We also put a 3 sigma lower limit on the X-ray Mach number of the S shock to be {\textgreater}1.6. Meanwhile, the deep observations reveal that the N subcluster is in a perfect cone shape, with a {\textasciitilde}400 kpc linear cold front on each side. This type of conic subcluster has been predicted by simulations but is observed here for the first time. It represents a transition stage between a blunt-body cold front and a slingshot cold front. Strikingly, we found a 400 kpc long gas trail attached to the apex of the cone, which could be due to the gas stripping. In addition, an over-pressured hot region is found in the SW flank of the cluster.},

	abstract = {Diffuse radio emission at the centre of galaxy clusters has been observed both in merging clusters on scales of Mpc, called giant radio haloes, and in relaxed systems with a cool-core on smaller scales, named mini haloes. Giant radio haloes and mini haloes are thought to be distinct classes of sources. However, recent observations have revealed the presence of diffuse radio emission on Mpc scales in clusters that do not show strong dynamical activity. RX J1720.1+2638 is a cool-core cluster, presenting both a bright central mini halo and a fainter diffuse, steep-spectrum emission extending beyond the cluster core that resembles giant radio halo emission. In this paper, we present new observations performed with the LOFAR Low Band Antennas (LBA) at 54 MHz. These observations, combined with data at higher frequencies, allow us to constrain the spectral properties of the radio emission. The large-scale emission presents an ultra-steep spectrum with \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{54\}{\textasciicircum}\{144\}{\textbackslash}sim3.2\$. The radio emission inside and outside the cluster core have strictly different properties, as there is a net change in spectral index and they follow different radio-X-ray surface brightness correlations. We argue that the large-scale diffuse emission is generated by particles re-acceleration after a minor merger. While for the central mini halo we suggest that it could be generated by secondary electrons and positrons from hadronic interactions of relativistic nuclei with the dense cool-core gas, as an alternative to re-acceleration models.},

	abstract = {Four decades ago, the firm detection of an Fe-K emission feature in the X-ray spectrum of the Perseus cluster revealed the presence of iron in its hot intracluster medium (ICM). With more advanced missions successfully launched over the last 20 years, this discovery has been extended to many other metals and to the hot atmospheres of many other galaxy clusters, groups, and giant elliptical galaxies, as evidence that the elemental bricks of life - synthesized by stars and supernovae - are also found at the largest scales of the Universe. Because the ICM, emitting in X-rays, is in collisional ionisation equilibrium, its elemental abundances can in principle be accurately measured. These abundance measurements, in turn, are valuable to constrain the physics and environmental conditions of the Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae that exploded and enriched the ICM over the entire cluster volume. On the other hand, the spatial distribution of metals across the ICM constitutes a remarkable signature of the chemical history and evolution of clusters, groups, and ellipticals. Here, we summarise the most significant achievements in measuring elemental abundances in the ICM, from the very first attempts up to the era of XMM-Newton, Chandra, and Suzaku and the unprecedented results obtained by Hitomi. We also discuss the current systematic limitations of these measurements and how the future missions XRISM and Athena will further improve our current knowledge of the ICM enrichment.},

Our measures extend to \$R\_\{500\}\$ and are corrected for a systematic error plaguing previous outskirt estimates. Our profiles flatten out at large radii, admittedly not a new result, however the radial range and representative nature of our sample extends its import well beyond previous findings. We find no evidence of segregation between cool-core and non-cool-core systems beyond \${\textbackslash}sim 0.3 R\_\{500\}\$, implying that, as was found for thermodynamic properties (Ghirardini et al, 2019), the physical state of the core does not affect global cluster properties. Our mean abundance within \$R\_\{500\}\$ shows a very modest scatter, \${\textless} \$15\%, suggesting the enrichment process must be quite similar in all these massive systems. This is a new finding and has significant implications on feedback processes. Together with results from thermodynamic properties presented in a previous X-COP paper, it affords a coherent picture where feedback effects do not vary significantly from one system to another. By combing ICM with stellar measurements we have found the amount of Fe diffused in the ICM to be about ten times higher than that locked in stars. Although our estimates suggest, with some strength, that the measured iron mass in clusters is well in excess of the predicted one, systematic errors prevent us from making a definitive statement. Further advancements will only be possible when systematic uncertainties, principally those associated to stellar masses, both within and beyond \$R\_\{500\}\$, can be reduced.},

(2012). We use the pseudo-entropy ratio to separate the Cool-Core (CC) cluster population, where the central gas density tends to be relatively higher, cooler and more metal rich, from the Non-Cool-Core systems. The average, redshift-independent, metal abundance measured in the 3 radial bins decrease moving outwards, with a mean metallicity in the core that is even 3 (two) times higher than the value of 0.16 times the solar abundance in Anders \& Grevesse (1989) estimated at r{\textgreater}0.4 R500 in CC (NCC) objects. We find that the values of the emission-weighted metallicity are well-fitted by the relation \$Z(z) = Z\_0 (1+z){\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}gamma\}\$ at given radius. A significant scatter, intrinsic to the observed distribution and of the order of 0.05-0.15, is observed below 0.4 R500. The nominal best-fit value of \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ is significantly different from zero in the inner cluster regions (\${\textbackslash}gamma = 1.6 {\textbackslash}pm 0.2\$) and in CC clusters only. These results are confirmed also with a bootstrap analysis, which provides a still significant negative evolution in the core of CC systems (P{\textgreater}99.9 per cent). No redshift-evolution is observed when regions above the core (r {\textgreater} 0.15 R500) are considered. A reasonable good fit of both the radial and redshift dependence is provided from the functional form \$Z(r,z)=Z\_0 (1+(r/0.15 R500){\textasciicircum}2){\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}beta\} (1+z){\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}gamma\}\$, with \$(Z\_0, {\textbackslash}beta, {\textbackslash}gamma) = (0.83 {\textbackslash}pm 0.13, 0.55 {\textbackslash}pm 0.07, 1.7 {\textbackslash}pm 0.6)\$ in CC clusters and \$(0.39 {\textbackslash}pm 0.04, 0.37 {\textbackslash}pm 0.15, 0.5 {\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$ for NCC systems.

	abstract = {We present the forward cosmological analysis of an \$XMM\$ selected sample of galaxy clusters out to a redshift of unity. Following our previous 2018 study based on the dn/dz quantity alone, we perform an upgraded cosmological analysis of the same XXL C1 cluster catalogue (178 objects), with a detailed account of the systematic errors. We follow the ASpiX methodology: the distribution of the observed X-ray properties of the cluster population is analysed in a 3D observable space (count rate, hardness ratio, redshift) and modelled as a function of cosmology. Compared to more traditional methods, ASpiX allows the inclusion of clusters down to a few tens of photons. We obtain an improvement by a factor of 2 compared to the previous analysis by letting the normalisation of the M-T relation and the evolution of the L-T relation free. Adding constraints from the XXL cluster 2-point correlation function and the BAO from various surveys decreases the uncertainties by 23 and 53 \% respectively, and 62\% when adding both. Switching to the scaling relations from the Subaru analysis, and letting free more parameters, our final constraints are \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ = \$0.99{\textasciicircum}\{+0.14\}\_\{-0.23\}\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$ = 0.296 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.034 (\$S\_8 = 0.98{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.21\}\$) for the XXL sample alone. Finally, we combine XXL ASpiX, the XXL cluster 2-point correlation function and the BAO, with 11 free parameters, allowing for the cosmological dependence of the scaling relations in the fit. We find \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ = \$0.793{\textasciicircum}\{+0.063\}\_\{-0.12\}\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$ = 0.364 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.015 (\$S\_8 = 0.872{\textasciicircum}\{+0.068\}\_\{-0.12\}\$), but still compatible with Planck CMB at 2.2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$. The results obtained by the ASpiX method are promising; further improvement is expected from the final XXL cosmological analysis involving a cluster sample twice as large.

	abstract = {The ASTRO-H mission was designed and developed through an international collaboration of JAXA, NASA, ESA, and the CSA. It was successfully launched on February 17, 2016, and then named Hitomi. During the in-orbit verification phase, the on-board observational instruments functioned as expected. The intricate coolant and refrigeration systems for soft X-ray spectrometer (SXS, a quantum micro-calorimeter) and soft X-ray imager (SXI, an X-ray CCD) also functioned as expected. However, on March 26, 2016, operations were prematurely terminated by a series of abnormal events and mishaps triggered by the attitude control system. These errors led to a fatal event: the loss of the solar panels on the Hitomi mission. The X-ray Astronomy Recovery Mission (or, XARM) is proposed to regain the key scientific advances anticipated by the international collaboration behind Hitomi. XARM will recover this science in the shortest time possible by focusing on one of the main science goals of Hitomi,“Resolving astrophysical problems by precise high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy”.$^{\textrm{1}}$ This decision was reached after evaluating the performance of the instruments aboard Hitomi and the mission’s initial scientific results, and considering the landscape of planned international X-ray astrophysics missions in 2020’s and 2030’s. Hitomi opened the door to high-resolution spectroscopy in the X-ray universe. It revealed a number of discrepancies between new observational results and prior theoretical predictions. Yet, the resolution pioneered by Hitomi is also the key to answering these and other fundamental questions. The high spectral resolution realized by XARM will not offer mere refinements; rather, it will enable qualitative leaps in astrophysics and plasma physics. XARM has therefore been given a broad scientific charge: “Revealing material circulation and energy transfer in cosmic plasmas and elucidating evolution of cosmic structures and objects”. To fulfill this charge, four categories of science objectives that were defined for Hitomi will also be pursued by XARM; these include (1) Structure formation of the Universe and evolution of clusters of galaxies; (2) Circulation history of baryonic matters in the Universe; (3) Transport and circulation of energy in the Universe; (4) New science with unprecedented high resolution X-ray spectroscopy. In order to achieve these scientific objectives, XARM will carry a 6 \&times; 6 pixelized X-ray micro-calorimeter on the focal plane of an X-ray mirror assembly, and an aligned X-ray CCD camera covering the same energy band and a wider field of view. This paper introduces the science objectives, mission concept, and observing plan of XARM.},

	abstract = {This White Paper, submitted to the recent ESA call for science themes to define its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformational leap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) How does ordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2) How do black holes grow and shape the Universe? Hot gas in clusters, groups and the intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local Universe. To understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation and assembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physical properties and evolution. This requires spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy with a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolving power compared to currently planned facilities. Feedback from supermassive black holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxy evolution models, but it is not well understood. X-ray observations can uniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes and determine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. Due to the effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requires knowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmic time, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. X-ray emission is the most reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed must improve by a factor {\textasciitilde}100 over current facilities to perform a full census into the early Universe. The Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (Athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution, spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionize our understanding of the Hot and Energetic Universe. These capabilities will also provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.},

For addressing these two issues, Athena+ will provide transformational capabilities in terms of angular resolution, effective area, spectral resolution, grasp, that will make it the most powerful X-ray observatory ever flown. Such an observatory, when opened to the astronomical community, will be used for virtually all classes of astrophysical objects, from high-z gamma-ray bursts to the closest planets in our solar neighborhood.

The catalogue contains 1227 entries, making it over six times the size of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Early SZ (ESZ) sample and the largest SZ-selected catalogue to date. It contains 861 confirmed clusters, of which 178 have been confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-up observations, and a further 683 are previously-known clusters.

	abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted “base ΛCDM” in this paper). From the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} temperature data combined with {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Mpc{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, a matter density parameter Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with {\textless}i{\textgreater}n{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of {\textless}i{\textgreater}τ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base ΛCDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} observations with other astrophysical data we find {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑ {\textless}i{\textgreater}m{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}ν{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with {\textbar} Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textbar} {\textless} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base ΛCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0.002{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless} 0.11, consistent with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 2013 results and consistent with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} (BKP) data. Adding the BKP {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0.002{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a {\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}i/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}φ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) ∝ {\textless}i{\textgreater}φ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} potential. The addition of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to {\textless}i{\textgreater}w{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = −1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base ΛCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base ΛCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

The programme, described in detail in this paper, aims to study the ultimate products of structure formation in time and mass. It is composed of a census of the most recent objects to have formed (Tier-1: 0.05 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.2; 2 x 10e14 M\_sun {\textless} M\_500 {\textless} 9 x 10e14 M\_sun), together with a sample of the highest-mass objects in the Universe (Tier-2: z {\textless} 0.6; M\_500 {\textgreater} 7.25 x 10e14 M\_sun). The programme will yield an accurate vision of the statistical properties of the underlying population, measure how the gas properties are shaped by collapse into the dark matter halo, uncover the provenance of non-gravitational heating, and resolve the major uncertainties in mass determination that limit the use of clusters for cosmological parameter estimation. We will acquire X-ray exposures of uniform depth, designed to obtain individual mass measurements accurate to 15-20\% under the hydrostatic assumption. We present the project motivations, describe the programme definition, and detail the ongoing multi-wavelength observational (lensing, SZ, radio) and theoretical effort that is being deployed in support of the project.},

	abstract = {Galaxy cluster mergers are a powerful laboratory for testing cosmological and astrophysical models. However, interpreting individual merging clusters depends crucially on their merger configuration, defined by the masses, velocities, impact parameters, and orientation of the merger axis with respect to the plane of the sky. In this work, we investigate the impact of merger parameters on the X-ray emitting intracluster medium and gravitational lensing maps using a suite of idealised simulations of binary cluster mergers performed using the GAMER-2 code. As a test case, we focus on modeling the Bullet Cluster-like merging system Abell 2146, in which deep {\textbackslash}textit\{Chandra\} X-ray and lensing observations revealed prominent merger shocks as well as the mass distribution and substructures associated with this merging cluster. We identify the most interesting parameter combinations, and evaluate the effects of various parameters on the properties of merger shocks observed by deep {\textbackslash}textit\{Chandra\} and lensing observations. We show that due gravitational compression of the cluster halos during the merger, previous mass estimates from weak lensing are too high. The plane of the merger is tilted further from the plane of the sky than estimated previously, up to \$30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ from the plane of the sky. We discuss the applicability of our results to multi-wavelength observations of merging galaxy clusters and their use as probes of cosmology and plasma physics.},

	abstract = {Model fitting is possibly the most extended problem in science. Classical approaches include the use of least-squares fitting procedures and maximum likelihood methods to estimate the value of the parameters in the model. However, in recent years, Bayesian inference tools have gained traction. Usually, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are applied to inference problems, but they present some disadvantages, particularly when comparing different models fitted to the same dataset. Other Bayesian methods can deal with this issue in a natural and effective way. We have implemented an importance sampling algorithm adapted to Bayesian inference problems in which the power of the noise in the observations is not known a priori. The main advantage of importance sampling is that the model evidence can be derived directly from the so-called importance weights -- while MCMC methods demand considerable postprocessing. The use of our adaptive target, adaptive importance sampling (ATAIS) method is shown by inferring, on the one hand, the parameters of a simulated flaring event which includes a damped oscillation \{\vphantom{\}}and, on the other hand, real data from the Kepler mission. ATAIS includes a novel automatic adaptation of the target distribution. It automatically estimates the variance of the noise in the model. ATAIS admits parallelisation, which decreases the computational run-times notably. We compare our method against a nested sampling method within a model selection problem.},

We highlight some noteworthy objects in the sample, including potentially projected systems, clusters with strong lensing features, clusters with active central galaxies or star formation, and systems of multiple clusters that may be physically associated.

Direct measurements of the gas velocities from the widths and shifts of X-ray emission lines were recently provided for the central region of the Perseus Cluster of galaxies by Hitomi, and upcoming high-resolution X-ray microcalorimeters onboard XRISM and Athena are expected to extend these studies to many more systems. In the mean time, several other direct and indirect methods have been proposed for estimating the velocity structure in the ICM, ranging from resonant scattering to X-ray surface brightness fluctuation analysis, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, or using optical line emitting nebulae in the brightest cluster galaxies as tracers of the motions of the ambient plasma. Here, we review and compare the existing estimates of the velocities of the hot baryons, as well as the various overlapping physical processes that drive motions in the ICM, and discuss the implications of these measurements for constraining the viscosity and identifying the source of turbulence in clusters of galaxies.},

The turbulence in turn amplifies weak seed magnetic fields of any origin. Supercomputer simulations show that the turbulence is subsonic inside clusters/groups of galaxies, whereas it is transonic or mildly supersonic in filaments. Based on a turbulence dynamo model, we then estimate that the average magnetic field strength would be a few microgauss inside clusters/groups, approximately 0.1 microgauss around clusters/groups, and approximately 10 nanogauss in filaments. Our model presents a physical mechanism that transfers the gravitation energy to the turbulence and magnetic field energies in the large scale structure of the universe.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01671},
	abstract = {Massive molecular gas has been discovered in giant elliptical galaxies at the centers of galaxy clusters. To reveal its role in AGN feedback in those galaxies, we construct a semi-analytic model of gas circulation. This model especially focuses on the massive molecular gas (interstellar cold gas on a scale of {\textasciitilde}10 kpc) and the circumnuclear disk ({\textasciitilde}{\textless} 0.5 kpc). We consider the destruction of the interstellar cold gas by star formation and the gravitational instability for the circumnuclear disk. Our model can reproduce the basic properties of the interstellar cold gas and the circumnuclear disk such as their masses. We also find that the circumnuclear disk tends to stay at the boundary between stable and unstable states. This works as an 'adjusting valve' that regulates mass accretion toward the supermassive black hole. On the other hand, the interstellar cold gas serves as a 'fuel tank' in the AGN feedback. Even if the cooling of the galactic hot gas is prevented, the interstellar cold gas can sustain the AGN activities for {\textasciitilde}{\textgreater} 0.5 Gyr. We also confirm that the small entropy of the hot gas ({\textasciitilde}{\textless} 30 keV cm{\textasciicircum}2) or the short cooling time ({\textasciitilde}{\textless} 1 Gyr) is a critical condition for the existence of the massive molecular gas in the galaxy. The dissipation time of the interstellar cold gas may be related to the critical cooling time.},

	abstract = {The gas in galaxy clusters is heated by shock compression through accretion (outer shocks) and mergers (inner shocks). These processes additionally produce turbulence. To analyse the relation between the thermal and turbulent energies of the gas under the influence of non-adiabatic processes, we performed numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation in a box of 152 Mpc comoving size with radiative cooling, UV background, and a subgrid scale model for numerically unresolved turbulence. By smoothing the gas velocities with an adaptive Kalman filter, we are able to estimate bulk flows towards cluster cores. This enables us to infer the velocity dispersion associated with the turbulent fluctuation relative to the bulk flow. For haloes with masses above 1013 M⊙, we find that the turbulent velocity dispersions averaged over the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) and the intracluster medium (ICM) are approximately given by powers of the mean gas temperatures with exponents around 0.5, corresponding to a roughly linear relation between turbulent and thermal energies and transonic Mach numbers. However, turbulence is only weakly correlated with the halo mass. Since the power-law relation is stiffer for the WHIM, the turbulent Mach number tends to increase with the mean temperature of the WHIM. This can be attributed to enhanced turbulence production relative to dissipation in particularly hot and turbulent clusters.},

Here, we investigate whether these scaling laws extend to lower-mass objects in dark-matter filaments. We perform a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a filament using an adaptive filtering technique for the resolved velocity component and a subgrid-scale model to account for the unresolved component. We then compute the mean turbulent and thermal energies for all halos in the zoom-in region and compare different definitions of halo averages. Averaging constrained by density and temperature thresholds is favored over averages solely based on virial spheres. We find no clear trend for the turbulent velocity dispersion versus halo mass, but significant correlation and a scaling law with exponent \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$ between the turbulent velocity dispersion and thermal energy that agrees with a nearly constant turbulent Mach number, similar to more massive objects.

	abstract = {Turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM) is driven by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) jets, by mergers, and in the wakes of infalling galaxies. It not only governs gas motion but also plays a key role in the ICM thermodynamics. Turbulence can help seed thermal instability by generating density fluctuations, and mix the hot and cold phases together to produce intermediate temperature gas (\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}7\${\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$) with short cooling times. We conduct high resolution (\$384{\textasciicircum}3\$--\$768{\textasciicircum}3\$ resolution elements) idealised simulations of the multiphase ICM and study the effects of turbulence strength, characterised by \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{turb\}\}\$ (\$0.001\$--\$1.0\$), the ratio of turbulent forcing power to the net radiative cooling rate. We analyse density and temperature distribution, amplitude and nature of gas perturbations, and probability of transitions across the temperature phases. We also study the effects of mass and volume-weighted thermal heating and weak ICM magnetic fields. For low \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{turb\}\}\$, the gas is distribution is bimodal between the hot and cold phases. The mixing between different phases becomes more efficient with increasing \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{turb\}\}\$, producing larger amounts of the intermediate temperature gas. Strong turbulence (\$f\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{turb\}\}{\textbackslash}geq0.5\$) generates larger density fluctuations and faster cooling, The rms logarithmic pressure fluctuation scaling with Mach number \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}ln\{{\textbackslash}bar\{P\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}approx{\textbackslash}ln(1+b{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}gamma{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}{\textasciicircum}4)\$ is unaffected by thermal instability and is the same as in hydro turbulence. In contrast, the density fluctuations characterised by \${\textbackslash}sigma\_s{\textasciicircum}2\$ are much larger, especially for \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}{\textbackslash}lesssim0.5\$. In magnetohydrodynamic runs, magnetic fields provide significant pressure support in the cold phase but do not have any strong effects on the diffuse gas distribution, and nature and amplitude of fluctuations.},

	abstract = {Structure formation in our Universe creates non-Gaussian random fields that will soon be observed over almost the entire sky by the Euclid satellite, the Vera-Rubin observatory, and the Square Kilometre Array. An unsolved problem is how to analyze such non-Gaussian fields best, e.g. to infer the physical laws that created them. This problem could be solved if a parametric non-Gaussian sampling distribution for such fields were known, as this distribution could serve as likelihood during inference. We therefore create a sampling distribution for non-Gaussian random fields. Our approach is capable of handling strong non-Gaussianity, while perturbative approaches such as the Edgeworth expansion cannot. To imitate cosmological structure formation, we enforce our fields to be (i) statistically isotropic, (ii) statistically homogeneous, and (iii) statistically independent at large distances. We generate such fields via a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique and find that even strong non-Gaussianity is not necessarily visible to the human eye. We also find that sampled marginals for pixel pairs have an almost generic Gauss-like appearance, even if the joint distribution of all pixels is markedly non-Gaussian. This apparent Gaussianity is a consequence of the high dimensionality of random fields. We conclude that vast amounts of non-Gaussian information can be hidden in random fields that appear nearly Gaussian in simple tests, and that it would be short-sighted not to try and extract it.},

We present high-quality measurements of hydrostatic masses and intracluster gas fraction out to the virial radius for a sample of 13 nearby clusters with available {\textless}i{\textgreater}XMM-Newton{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data. We compare our hydrostatic gas fractions with the expected universal gas fraction to constrain the level of non-thermal pressure support. We find that hydrostatic masses require little correction and infer a median non-thermal pressure fraction of ∼6\% and ∼10\% at {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}200{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, respectively. Our values are lower than the expectations of hydrodynamical simulations, possibly implying a faster thermalization of the gas. If instead we use the mass calibration adopted by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} team, we find that the gas fraction of massive local systems implies a mass bias 1 − {\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.85 ± 0.05 for Sunyaev–Zeldovich-derived masses, with some evidence for a mass-dependent bias. Conversely, the high bias required to match {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} cosmic microwave background and cluster count cosmology is excluded by the data at high significance, unless the most massive halos are missing a substantial fraction of their baryons.},

	abstract = {The on-going X-ray all-sky survey with the eROSITA instrument will yield large galaxy cluster samples, which will bring strong constraints on cosmological parameters. In particular, the survey holds great promise to investigate the tension between CMB and low-redshift measurements. The current bottleneck preventing the full exploitation of the survey data is the systematics associated with the relation between survey observable and halo mass. Numerous recent studies have shown that gas mass and core-excised X-ray luminosity exhibit very low scatter at fixed mass. We propose a new method to reconstruct these quantities from low photon count data and validate the method using extensive eROSITA-like simulations. We find that even near the detection threshold of {\textasciitilde}50 counts the core-excised luminosity and the gas mass can be recovered with 20-30\% precision, which is substantially less than the scatter of the full integrated X-ray luminosity at fixed mass. When combined with an accurate calibration of the absolute mass scale (e.g. through weak gravitational lensing), our technique reduces the systematics on cosmological parameters induced by the mass calibration.},

	abstract = {We conduct numerical experiments to determine the density probability distribution function (PDF) produced in supersonic, isothermal, self-gravitating turbulence of the sort that is ubiquitous in star-forming molecular clouds. Our experiments cover a wide range of turbulent Mach number and virial parameter, allowing us for the first time to determine how the PDF responds as these parameters vary, and we introduce a new diagnostic, the dimensionless star formation efficiency versus density (\${\textbackslash}epsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}(s)\$) curve, which provides a sensitive diagnostic of the PDF shape and dynamics. We show that the PDF follows a universal functional form consisting of a log-normal at low density with two distinct power law tails at higher density; the first of these represents the onset of self-gravitation, and the second reflects the onset of rotational support. Once the star formation efficiency reaches a few percent, the PDF becomes statistically steady, with no evidence for secular time-evolution at star formation efficiencies from about five to 20 percent. We show that both the Mach number and the virial parameter influence the characteristic densities at which the log-normal gives way to the first power-law, and the first to the second, and we extend (for the former) and develop (for the latter) simple theoretical models for the relationship between these density thresholds and the global properties of the turbulent medium.},

	abstract = {Previous X-ray studies of the Perseus Cluster, consisting of 85 Suzaku pointings along eight azimuthal directions, revealed a particularly steep decrease in the projected temperature profile near the virial radius ({\textasciitilde}r200) towards the northwest (NW). To further explore this shock candidate, another 4 Suzaku observations on the NW edge of the Perseus Cluster have been obtained. These deeper data were designed to provide the best possible control of systematic uncertainties in the spectral analysis. Using the combined Suzaku observations, we have carefully investigated this interesting region by analyzing the spectra of various annuli and extracting projected thermodynamic profiles. We find that the projected temperature profile shows a break near r200, indicating a shock with M = 1.9+-0.3. Corresponding discontinuities are also found in the projected emission measure and the density profiles at the same location. This evidence of a shock front so far away from the cluster center is unprecedented, and may provide a first insight into the properties of large-scale virial shocks which shape the process of galaxy cluster growth.},

In particular, we show that spectroscopic surveys with high redshift resolution are affected by small scales already on large angular scales, i.e. at low multipoles. Therefore, when considering the angular power spectrum with spectroscopic redshift resolution, it is important to account for non-linearities relevant on small scales even at low multipoles. This may also motivate the use of the correlation function instead of the angular power spectrum. These effects, which are very relevant for bin auto-correlations, but not so important for cross-correlations, are quantified in detail.},

	abstract = {The galaxy cluster Abell 3266 is one of the X-ray brightest in the sky and is a well-known merging system. Using the ability of the eROSITA telescope onboard SRG (Spectrum R{\textbackslash}"ontgen Gamma) to observe a wide field with a single pointing, we analyse a new observation of the cluster out to a radius of R\_200. The X-ray images highlight substructures present in the cluster, including the northeast-southwest merger seen in previous ASCA, Chandra and XMM-Newton data, a merging group towards the northwest and filamentary structures between the core and one or more groups towards the west. We compute spatially-resolved spectroscopic maps of the thermodynamic properties of the cluster, including the metallicity. The merging subclusters are seen as low entropy material within the cluster. The filamentary structures could be the rims of a powerful AGN outburst, or most likely material stripped from the western group(s) as they passed through the cluster core. Seen in two directions is a pressure jump at a radius of 1.1 Mpc consistent with a shock with a Mach number of {\textasciitilde}1.5-1.7. The eROSITA data confirm that the cluster is not a simple merging system, but is made up of several subclusters which are merging or will shortly merge. For the first time we find a radio halo associated with the system detected in GLEAM data. We compute a hydrostatic mass from the eROSITA data, finding good agreement with a previous XMM-Newton result. With this pointing we detect several extended sources, where we find for seven of them secure associations between z=0.36-1.0; i.e., background galaxy groups and clusters, highlighting the power of eROSITA to find such systems.},

	abstract = {Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a crucial component of the current paradigms of star formation, dynamo theory, particle transport, magnetic reconnection and evolution of structure in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. Despite the importance of turbulence to astrophysical fluids, a full theoretical framework based on solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations remains intractable. Observations provide only limited line-of-sight information on densities, temperatures, velocities and magnetic field strengths and therefore directly measuring turbulence in the ISM is challenging. A statistical approach has been of great utility in allowing comparisons of observations, simulations and analytic predictions. In this review article we address the growing importance of MHD turbulence in many fields of astrophysics and review statistical diagnostics for studying interstellar and interplanetary turbulence. In particular, we will review statistical diagnostics and machine learning algorithms that have been developed for observational data sets in order to obtain information about the turbulence cascade, fluid compressibility (sonic Mach number), and magnetization of fluid (Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic Mach number). These techniques have often been tested on numerical simulations of MHD turbulence, which may include the creation of synthetic observations, and are often formulated on theoretical expectations for compressible magnetized turbulence. We stress the use of multiple techniques, as this can provide a more accurate indication of the turbulence parameters of interest. We conclude by describing several open-source tools for the astrophysical community to use when dealing with turbulence.},

	abstract = {Cosmological probes based on galaxy clusters rely on cluster number counts and large-scale structure information. X-ray cluster surveys are well suited for this purpose, since they are far less affected than optical surveys by projection effects, and cluster properties can be predicted with good accuracy. The XMM Cluster Archive Super Survey, X-CLASS, is a serendipitous search of X-ray-detected galaxy clusters in 4176 XMM-Newton archival observations until August 2015. All observations are clipped to exposure times of 10 and 20 ks to obtain uniformity and they span {\textasciitilde}269 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ across the high-Galactic latitude sky (\${\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textgreater} 20{\textasciicircum}o\$). The main goal of the survey is the compilation of a well-selected cluster sample suitable for cosmological analyses. We describe the detection algorithm, the visual inspection, the verification process and the redshift validation of the cluster sample, as well as the cluster selection function computed by simulations. We also present the various metadata that are released with the catalogue, along with the redshifts of 124 clusters obtained with a dedicated multi-object spectroscopic follow-up programme. With this publication we release the new X-CLASS catalogue of 1646 well-selected X-ray-detected clusters over a wide sky area, along with their selection function. The sample spans a wide redshift range, from the local Universe up to z{\textasciitilde}1.5, with 982 spectroscopically confirmed clusters, and over 70 clusters above z=0.8. Because of its homogeneous selection and thorough verification, the cluster sample can be used for cosmological analyses, but also as a test-bed for the upcoming eROSITA observations and other current and future large-area cluster surveys. It is the first time that such a catalogue is made available to the community via an interactive database which gives access to a wealth of supplementary information, images, and data.},

	abstract = {Studies of cluster mass and velocity anisotropy profiles are useful tests of dark matter models, and of the assembly history of clusters of galaxies. These studies might be affected by unknown systematics caused by projection effects. We aim at testing observational methods for the determination of mass and velocity anisotropy profiles of clusters of galaxies. Particularly, we focus on the MAMPOSSt technique (Mamon et al. 2013). We use results from two semi-analytic models of galaxy formation coupled with high-resolution N-body cosmological simulations, the catalog of De Lucia \& Blaizot (2007) and the FIRE catalog based on the new GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly model. We test the reliability of the Jeans equation in recovering the true mass profile when full projected phase-space information is available. We examine the reliability of the MAMPOSSt method in estimating the true mass and velocity anisotropy profiles of the simulated halos when only projected phase-space information is available, as in observations. The spherical Jeans equation provides a reliable tool for the determination of cluster mass profiles, also for subsamples of tracers separated by galaxy color. Results are equally good for prolate and oblate clusters. Using only projected phase-space information, MAMPOSSt provides estimates of the mass profile with a standard deviation of 35-69 \%, and a negative bias of 7-17 \%, nearly independent of radius, and that we attribute to the presence of interlopers in the projected samples. The bias changes sign, that is, the mass is over-estimated, for prolate clusters with their major axis aligned along the line-of-sight. MAMPOSSt measures the velocity anisotropy profiles accurately in the inner cluster regions, with a slight overestimate in the outer regions, both for the whole sample of observationally-identified cluster members and separately for red and blue galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of the radial profiles of the mass and galaxy number density around Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-selected clusters using both weak lensing and galaxy counts. The clusters are selected from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 5 and the galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 dataset. With signal-to-noise of 62 (43) for galaxy (weak lensing) profiles over scales of about \$0.2-20h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ Mpc, these are the highest precision measurements for SZ-selected clusters to date. Because SZ selection closely approximates mass selection, these measurements enable several tests of theoretical models of the mass and light distribution around clusters. Our main findings are: 1. The splashback feature is detected at a consistent location in both the mass and galaxy profiles and its location is consistent with predictions of cold dark matter N-body simulations. 2. The full mass profile is also consistent with the simulations; hence it can constrain alternative dark matter models that modify the mass distribution of clusters. 3. The shapes of the galaxy and lensing profiles are remarkably similar for our sample over the entire range of scales, from well inside the cluster halo to the quasilinear regime. This can be used to constrain processes such as quenching and tidal disruption that alter the galaxy distribution inside the halo, and scale-dependent features in the transition regime outside the halo. We measure the dependence of the profile shapes on the galaxy sample, redshift and cluster mass. We extend the Diemer {\textbackslash}\& Kravtsov model for the cluster profiles to the linear regime using perturbation theory and show that it provides a good match to the measured profiles. We also compare the measured profiles to predictions of the standard halo model and simulations that include hydrodynamics. Applications of these results to cluster mass estimation and cosmology are discussed.},

We made use of an optimised Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) map reconstructed from the two data sets and tailored for the detection of the SZ effect, taking advantage of both Planck coverage of large scales and the ACT higher spatial resolution. Our average pressure profile covers a radial range going from 0.04xR\_500 in the central parts to 2.5xR\_500 in the outskirts. In this way, it improves upon previous pressure-profile reconstruction based on SZ measurements. It is compatible, as well as competitive, with constraints derived from joint X-ray and SZ analysis.

	abstract = {We present the analysis of XMM-Newton observations of two X-ray luminous cool core clusters, RXCJ1504.1-0248 and Abell 1664. The Reflection Grating Spectrometer reveals a radiative cooling rate of \$180{\textbackslash}pm 40{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and \$34{\textbackslash}pm 6{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in RXCJ1504.1-0248 and Abell 1664 for gas above 0.7 keV, respectively. These cooling rates are higher than the star formation rates observed in the clusters, and support simultaneous star formation and molecular gas mass growth on a timescale of 3\${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ yr or longer. At these rates, the energy of the X-ray cooling gas is inadequate to power the observed UV/optical line-emitting nebulae, which suggests additional strong heating. No significant residual cooling is detected below 0.7 keV in RXCJ1504.1-0248. By simultaneously fitting the first and second order spectra, we place an upper limit on turbulent velocity of 300 km\${\textbackslash}rm s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at 90 per cent confidence level for the soft X-ray emitting gas in both clusters. The turbulent energy density is considered to be less than 8.9 and 27 per cent of the thermal energy density in RXCJ1504.1-0248 and Abell 1664, respectively. This means it is insufficient for AGN heating to fully propagate throughout the cool core via turbulence. We find the cool X-ray component of Abell 1664 (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.8 keV) is blueshifted from the systemic velocity by 750\${\textasciicircum}\{+800\}\_\{-280\}\$ km\${\textbackslash}rm s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. This is consistent with one component of the molecular gas in the core and suggests a similar dynamical structure for the two phases. We find that an intrinsic absorption model allows the cooling rate to increase to \$520{\textbackslash}pm 30{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in RXCJ1504.1-0248.},

	abstract = {Galaxy clusters are considered to be gigantic reservoirs of cosmic rays (CRs). Some of the clusters are found with extended radio emission, which provides evidence for the existence of magnetic fields and CR electrons in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). The mechanism of radio halo (RH) emission is still under debate, and it has been believed that turbulent reacceleration plays an important role. In this paper, we study the reacceleration of CR protons and electrons in detail by numerically solving the Fokker-Planck equation, and show how radio and gamma-ray observations can be used to constrain CR distributions and resulting high-energy emission for the Coma cluster. We take into account the radial diffusion of CRs and follow the time evolution of their one-dimensional distribution, by which we investigate the radial profile of the CR injection that is consistent with the observed RH surface brightness. We find that the required injection profile is non-trivial, depending on whether CR electrons have the primary or secondary origin. Although the secondary CR electron scenario predicts larger gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, it is in tension with the observed RH spectrum. In either scenario, we find that galaxy clusters can make a sizable contribution to the all-sky neutrino intensity if the CR energy spectrum is nearly flat.},

	abstract = {It is generally taken for granted that our Universe is free of antimatter objects and domains. This certitude has recently been challenged by the possible detection of antihelium nuclei by AMS-02. Should the observation be confirmed, the existence of nearby antistars would make a plausible hypothesis to explain the origin of the antinuclei. In this paper, we use the 10-year Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) gamma-ray source catalog to set constraints on the abundance of antistars around the Sun. We identify in the catalog 14 antistar candidates not associated with any objects belonging to established gamma-ray source classes and with a spectrum compatible with baryon-antibaryon annihilation. We use them along with an estimate of the LAT sensitivity to antistars to set upper limits on the local antistar fraction f¯∗ with respect to normal stars. We provide parametric limits as a function of the closest antistar mass, velocity, and surrounding matter density. We also employ a novel Monte Carlo method to set limits for a few hypotheses about the antistar population. For a population with properties equivalent to those of regular stars concentrated in the Galactic disk, we obtain f¯∗{\textless}2.5×10−6 at 95\% confidence level, which is 20 times more constraining than limits previously available. For a primordial population of antistars distributed in the Galactic halo, we obtain new local upper limits which decrease as a function of antistar mass M from f¯∗{\textless}0.2 at 95\% confidence level for M=1 M⊙ to f¯∗{\textless}1.6×10−4 at 95\% confidence level for M=10 M⊙. By combining these limits with existing microlensing constraints for lighter objects in the Magellanic Clouds, we infer that a primordial population of halo antistars must have a density lower than O(10−5 pc−3) to O(10−2 pc−3) depending on their masses. Our limits can constrain models for the origin and propagation of antinuclei in cosmic rays.},

	abstract = {Both simulations and observations have shown that turbulence is a pervasive phenomenon in cosmic scenarios, yet it is particularly difficult to model numerically due to its intrinsically multiscale character which demands high resolutions. Additionally, turbulence is tightly connected to the dynamical state and the formation history of galaxies and galaxy clusters, producing a diverse phenomenlogy which requires large samples of such structures to attain robust conclusions. In this work, we use an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) cosmological simulation to explore the generation and dissipation of turbulence in galaxy clusters, in connection to its assembly history. We find that major mergers, and more generally accretion of gas, is the main process driving turbulence in the ICM. We have especially focused on solenoidal turbulence, which can be quantified through enstrophy. Our results seem to confirm a scenario for its generation which involves baroclinicity and compression at the external (accretion) and internal (merger) shocks, followed by vortex stretching downstream of them. We have also looked at the infall of mass to the cluster beyond its virial boundary, finding that gas follows trajectories with some degree of helicity, as it has already developed some vorticity in the external shocks.},

	abstract = {Large samples of galaxy clusters provide knowledge of both astrophysics in the most massive virialised environments and the properties of the cosmological model that defines our Universe. However, an important issue that affects the interpretation of galaxy cluster samples is the role played by the selection waveband and the potential for this to introduce a bias in the physical properties of clusters thus selected. We aim to investigate waveband-dependent selection effects in the identification of galaxy clusters by comparing the X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM) Ultimate Extra-galactic Survey (XXL) and Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) CAMIRA cluster samples identified from a common 22.6 deg2 sky area. We compare 150 XXL and 270 CAMIRA clusters in a common parameter space defined by X-ray aperture brightness and optical richness. We find that 71/150 XXL clusters are matched to the location of a CAMIRA cluster, the majority of which (67/71) display richness values N{\textgreater}15 that exceed the CAMIRA catalogue richness threshold. We find that 67/270 CAMIRA clusters are matched to the location of an XXL cluster (defined within XXL as an extended X-ray source). Of the unmatched CAMIRA clusters, the majority display low X-ray fluxes consistent with the lack of an XXL counterpart. However, a significant fraction (64/107) CAMIRA clusters that display high X-ray fluxes are not asociated with an extended source in the XXL catalogue. We demonstrate that this disparity arises from a variety of effects including the morphological criteria employed to identify X-ray clusters and the properties of the XMM PSF.},

	abstract = {Thermal gas in the center of galaxy clusters can show substantial motions that generate surface brightness and temperature discontinuities known as cold fronts. The motions may be triggered by minor or off-axis mergers that preserve the cool-core of the system. The dynamics of the thermal gas can also generate radio emission from the intra-cluster medium (ICM) and impact the evolution of clusters radio sources. We study the central region of Abell 1775, a system in an ambiguous dynamical state at \$z=0.072\$ which is known to host an extended head-tail radio galaxy, with the aim of investigating the connection between thermal and non-thermal components in its center. We made use of a deep (100 ks) Chandra observation accompanied by LOFAR 144 MHz, GMRT 235 MHz and 610 MHz, and VLA 1.4 GHz radio data. We find a spiral-like pattern in the X-ray surface brightness that is mirrored in the temperature and pseudo-entropy maps. Additionally, we characterize an arc-shaped cold front in the ICM. We interpret these features in the context of a slingshot gas tail scenario. The structure of the head-tail radio galaxy "breaks" at the position of the cold front, showing an extension that is detected only at low frequencies, likely due to its steep and curved spectrum. We speculate that particle re-acceleration is occurring in the outer region of this tail, that in total covers a projected size of \${\textbackslash}sim800\$ kpc. We also report the discovery of revived fossil plasma with ultra-steep spectrum radio emission in the cluster core together with a central diffuse radio source that is bounded by the arc-shaped cold front. The results reported in this work demonstrate the interplay between thermal and non-thermal components in the cluster center and the presence of ongoing particle re-acceleration in the ICM on different scales.},

	abstract = {Nested sampling is an important tool for conducting Bayesian analysis in Astronomy and other fields, both for sampling complicated posterior distributions for parameter inference, and for computing marginal likelihoods for model comparison. One technical obstacle to using nested sampling in practice is the requirement that prior distributions be provided in the form of bijective transformations from the unit hyper-cube to the target prior density. For many applications - particularly when using the posterior from one experiment as the prior for another - such a transformation is not readily available. In this letter we show that parametric bijectors trained on samples from a desired prior density provide a general-purpose method for constructing transformations from the uniform base density to a target prior, enabling the practical use of nested sampling under arbitrary priors. We demonstrate the use of trained bijectors in conjunction with nested sampling on a number of examples from cosmology.},

In this paper we develop a SFB power spectrum estimator that allows the measurement of the largest angular and radial modes with the next generation of galaxy surveys. The code measures the pseudo-SFB power spectrum, and takes into account mask, selection function, pixel window, and shot noise. We show that the local average effect is significant only in the largest-scale mode, and we provide an analytical covariance matrix. By imposing boundary conditions at the minimum and maximum radius encompassing the survey volume, the estimator does not suffer from the numerical instabilities that have proven challenging in the past. The estimator is demonstrated on simplified Roman-like, SPHEREx-like, and Euclid-like mask and selection functions. For intuition and validation, we also explore the SFB power spectrum in the Limber approximation. We release the associated public code written in Julia.},

	abstract = {We report on the possibility of studying the properties of cosmic diffuse baryons by studying self-gravitating clumps and filaments connected to galaxy clusters. While filaments are challenging to detect with X-ray observations, the higher density of clumps make them visible and a viable tracer to study the thermodynamical properties of baryons undergoing accretion along cosmic web filaments onto galaxy clusters. We developed new algorithms to identify these structures in a set of non-radiative high-resolution simulations of galaxy clusters, cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters. We show that the density and temperature of clumps are independent of the mass of the cluster where they reside. We detected a positive correlation between the filament temperature and the host cluster mass. Density and Temperature of clumps and filaments tend to correlate. Both decrease moving outward. We observe that clumps are hotter, more massive and more luminous if identified closer to the cluster center. Clumps and filaments contribute to {\textasciitilde}17 (1) per cent of the gas mass (volume) outside R500,c, with clumps contributing a factor of 2 more. Especially in the outermost cluster regions ({\textasciitilde}3*R500,c or beyond) X-ray observations might already have the chance of locating filaments based on the distribution of clumps, and by studying the thermodynamics of diffuse baryons before they are processed by the dynamical interaction with the host intracluster medium.},

This is the first such analysis to marginalize over an empirical, data-driven prior on the overall accuracy of X-ray temperature measurements, while our restriction to the most relaxed, massive clusters also minimizes astrophysical systematics. For a cosmological-constant model with \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.3\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}Lambda\} = 0.7\$, we find \$H\_0 = 67.3{\textasciicircum}\{+21.3\}\_\{-13.3\}\$ km/s/Mpc, limited by the temperature calibration uncertainty (compared to the statistically limited constraint of \$H\_0 = 72.3{\textasciicircum}\{+7.6\}\_\{-7.6\}\$ km/s/Mpc). The intrinsic scatter in the X-ray/SZ pressure ratio is found to be \$13 {\textbackslash}pm 4\$ per cent (\$10 {\textbackslash}pm 3\$ per cent when two clusters with significant galactic dust emission are removed from the sample), consistent with being primarily due to triaxiality and projection. We discuss the prospects for reducing the dominant systematic limitation to this analysis, with improved X-ray calibration and/or precise measurements of the relativistic SZ effect providing a plausible route to per cent level constraints on \$H\_0\$.},

Using archival data of the Abell 85 cluster of galaxies taken with Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope, we show that using careful data processing can unveil the diffuse light within the cluster, the intracluster light. We reach surface brightness limits of \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{limit\}\$(3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$, 10"x10") = 30.9 mag/arcsec\${\textasciicircum}2\$, and \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{i\}{\textasciicircum}\{limit\}\$(3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$, 10"x10") = 29.7 mag/arcsec\${\textasciicircum}2\$. We measured the radial surface brightness profiles of the brightest cluster galaxy out to the intracluster light (radius \${\textbackslash}sim215\$ kpc), for the g and i bands. We found that both the surface brightness and the color profiles become shallower beyond \${\textbackslash}sim75\$ kpc suggesting that a distinct component, the intracluster light, starts to dominate at that radius. The color of the profile at \${\textbackslash}sim100\$ kpc suggests that the buildup of the intracluster light of Abell 85 occurs by the stripping of massive (\${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) satellites.

	abstract = {SPIDERS is the spectroscopic follow-up effort of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) project for the identification of X-ray selected galaxy clusters. We present our catalogue of 2740 visually inspected galaxy clusters as a part of the SDSS Data Release 16 (DR16). Here we detail the target selection, our methods for validation of the candidate clusters, performance of the survey, the construction of the final sample, and a full description of what is found in the catalogue. Of the sample, the median number of members per cluster is approximately 10, with 818 having 15 or greater. We find that we are capable of validating over 99\% of clusters when 5 redshifts are obtained below \$z{\textless}0.3\$ and when 9 redshifts are obtained above \$z{\textgreater}0.3\$. We discuss the improvements of this catalogue's identification of cluster using 33,340 redshifts, with \${\textbackslash}Delta z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{phot\}\} / {\textbackslash}Delta z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{spec\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 100\$, over other photometric and spectroscopic surveys, as well as present an update to previous (\${\textbackslash}sigma - L\_\{X\}\$) and (\${\textbackslash}sigma - {\textbackslash}lambda\$) relations. Finally, we present our cosmological constraints derived using the velocity dispersion function.},

	abstract = {Large amounts of deep optical images will be available in the near future, allowing statistically significant studies of low surface brightness structures such as intracluster light (ICL) in galaxy clusters. The detection of these structures requires efficient algorithms dedicated to this task, where traditional methods suffer difficulties. We present our new Detection Algorithm with Wavelets for Intracluster light Studies (DAWIS), developed and optimised for the detection of low surface brightness sources in images, in particular (but not limited to) ICL. DAWIS follows a multiresolution vision based on wavelet representation to detect sources, embedded in an iterative procedure called synthesis-by-analysis approach to restore the complete unmasked light distribution of these sources with very good quality. The algorithm is built so sources can be classified based on criteria depending on the analysis goal; we display in this work the case of ICL detection and the measurement of ICL fractions. We test the efficiency of DAWIS on 270 mock images of galaxy clusters with various ICL profiles and compare its efficiency to more traditional ICL detection methods such as the surface brightness threshold method. We also run DAWIS on a real galaxy cluster image, and compare the output to results obtained with previous multiscale analysis algorithms. We find in simulations that in average DAWIS is able to disentangle galaxy light from ICL more efficiently, and to detect a greater quantity of ICL flux due to the way it handles sky background noise. We also show that the ICL fraction, a metric used on a regular basis to characterise ICL, is subject to several measurement biases both on galaxies and ICL fluxes. In the real galaxy cluster image, DAWIS detects a faint and extended source with an absolute magnitude two orders brighter than previous multiscale methods.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03517},
	abstract = {Vast cavities in the intergalactic medium are excavated by radio galaxies. The cavities appear as such in X-ray images because the external medium has been swept up, leaving a hot but low density bubble surrounding the radio lobes. We explore here the predicted thermal X-ray emission from a large set of high-resolution three dimensional simulations of radio galaxies driven by supersonic jets. We assume adiabatic non-relativistic hydrodynamics with injected straight and precessing jets of supersonic gas emitted from nozzles. Images of X-ray Bremsstrahlung emission tend to generate oval cavities in the soft keV bands and leading arcuate structures in hard X-rays. However, the cavity shape is sensitive to the jet-ambient density contrast, varying from concave-shaped at \${\textbackslash}eta = 0.1\$ to convex for \${\textbackslash}eta = 0.0001\$ where \${\textbackslash}eta\$ is the jet/ambient density ratio. We find lateral ribs in the soft X-rays in certain cases and propose this as an explanation for those detected in the vicinity of Cygnus{\textbackslash},A. In bi-lobed or X-shaped sources and in curved or deflected jets, the strongest X-ray emission is not associated with the hotspot but with the relic lobe or deflection location. This is because the hot high-pressure and dense high-compression regions do not coincide. Directed toward the observer, the cavity becomes a deep round hole surrounded by circular ripples. With short radio-mode outbursts with a duty cycle of 10{\textbackslash}\% , the intracluster medium simmers with low Mach number shocks widely dissipating the jet energy in between active jet episodes.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03176},
	abstract = {Stars form in molecular clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM) with a turbulent kinematic state. Newborn stars therefore should retain the turbulent kinematics of their natal clouds. Gaia DR2 and APOGEE-2 surveys in combination provide three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D velocities of young stars in the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. Using the full 6D measurements, we compute the velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the stars in six different groups within the Orion Complex. We find that the motions of stars in all diffuse groups exhibit strong characteristics of turbulence. Their first-order VSFs have a power-law exponent ranging from \${\textbackslash}sim0.2-0.5\$ on scales of a few to a few tens of pc, generally consistent with Larson's relation. On the other hand, dense star clusters, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), have experienced rapid dynamical relaxation, and have lost the memory of the initial turbulent kinematics. The VSFs of several individual groups and the whole Complex all show features supporting local energy injection from supernovae. The measured strength of turbulence depends on the location relative to the supernova epicenters and the formation history of the groups. Our detection of turbulence traced by young stars introduces a new method of probing the turbulent kinematics of the ISM. Unlike previous gas-based studies with only projected measurements accessible to observations, we utilize the full 6D information of stars, presenting a more complete picture of the 3D interstellar turbulence.},

We develop a new procedure in order to tackle the analysis challenge that is estimating the intracluster medium (ICM) properties of low-mass and high-redshift clusters with \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}150\$ X-ray counts. One of the dominant sources of uncertainty on the ICM density profile estimated with a standard X-ray analysis with such shallow X-ray data is due to the systematic uncertainty associated with the ICM temperature obtained through the analysis of the background-dominated X-ray spectrum. We show that we can decrease the uncertainty on the density profile by a factor \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}5\$ with a joint deprojection of the X-ray surface brightness profile measured by \$Chandra\$ and the SZ integrated Compton parameter available in the SPT cluster catalog. We apply this technique to the whole sample of 67 clusters in order to track the evolution of the ICM core density during cluster growth. We confirm that the evolution of the gas density profile is well modeled by the combination of a fixed core and a self-similarly evolving non-cool core profile. We show that the fraction of cool-cores in this sample is remarkably stable with redshift although clusters have gained a factor \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}4\$ in total mass over the past \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}9\$ Gyr. This new sample combined with our new X-ray/SZ analysis procedure and extensive multi-wavelength data will allow us to address fundamental shortcomings in our current understanding of cluster formation and evolution at \$z {\textgreater} 1\$.},

	abstract = {The role of the environment on the formation of S0 galaxies is still not well understood, specifically in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. We study eight low-redshift clusters, analyzing galaxy members up to cluster-centric distances \${\textbackslash}sim2.5{\textbackslash},R\_\{200\}\$. We perform 2D photometric bulge-disk decomposition in the \$g\$-, \$r\$- and \$i\$-bands from which we identify 469 double-component galaxies. We analyze separately the colors of the bulges and the disks and their dependence on the projected cluster-centric distance and on the local galaxy density. For our sample of cluster S0 galaxies, we find that bulges are redder than their surrounding disks, show a significant color-magnitude trend, and have colors that do not correlate with environment metrics. On the other hand, the disks associated with our cluster S0s become significantly bluer with increasing cluster-centric radius, but show no evidence for a color-magnitude relation. The disk color-radius relation is mainly driven by galaxies in the cluster core at \$0{\textbackslash}leq R/ R\_\{200\}{\textless}0.5\$. No significant difference is found for the disk colors of backsplash and infalling galaxies in the projected phase space. Beyond \$R\_\{200\}\$, the disk colors do not change with the local galaxy density, indicating that the colors of double-component galaxies are not affected by pre-processing. A significant color-density relation is observed for single-component disk-dominated galaxies beyond \$R\_\{200\}\$. We conclude that the formation of cluster S0 galaxies is primarily driven by cluster core processes acting on the disks, while evidence of pre-processing is found for single-component disk-dominated galaxies.

Our first model, CNN\$\_{\textbackslash}text\{1D\}\$, infers cluster mass directly from the distribution of member galaxy line-of-sight velocities. Our second model, CNN\$\_{\textbackslash}text\{2D\}\$, extends the input space of CNN\$\_{\textbackslash}text\{1D\}\$ to learn on the joint distribution of galaxy line-of-sight velocities and projected radial distances. We train each model as a regression over cluster mass using a labeled catalog of realistic mock cluster observations generated from the MultiDark simulation and UniverseMachine catalog. We then evaluate the performance of each model on an independent set of mock observations selected from the same simulated catalog. The CNN models produce cluster mass predictions with lognormal residuals of scatter as low as \$0.132\$ dex, greater than a factor of 2 improvement over the classical \$M\$-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ power-law estimator. Furthermore, the CNN model reduces prediction scatter relative to similar machine learning approaches by up to \$17{\textbackslash}\%\$ while executing in drastically shorter training and evaluation times (by a factor of 30) and producing considerably more robust mass predictions (improving prediction stability under variations in galaxy sampling rate by \$30{\textbackslash}\%\$).},

The data cover \${\textbackslash}sim3{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ{\textbackslash}times 3{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ area around the cluster with a typical exposure time of more than 20 ks. The stability of the instrumental background and operation of the {\textbackslash}textit\{SRG\} Observatory in the scanning mode provided us with an excellent data set for studies of the diffuse emission up to a distance of \${\textbackslash}sim 1.5R\_\{200\}\$ from the Coma center. In this study, we discuss the rich morphology revealed by the X-ray observations (also in combination with the SZ data) and argue that the most salient features can be naturally explained by a recent (on-going) merger with the NGC 4839 group. In particular, we identify a faint X-ray bridge connecting the group with the cluster, which is convincing proof that NGC 4839 has already crossed the main cluster. The gas in the Coma core went through two shocks, first through the shock driven by NGC 4839 during its first passage through the cluster some Gyr ago, and, more recently, through the "mini-accretion shock" associated with the gas settling back to quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium in the core. After passing through the primary shock, the gas should spend much of the time in a rarefaction region, where radiative losses of electrons are small, until the gas is compressed again by the mini-accretion shock. Unlike "runway" merger shocks, the mini-accretion shock does not feature a rarefaction region downstream and, therefore, the radio emission can survive longer. Such a two-stage process might explain the formation of the radio halo in the Coma cluster.},

We investigate this scenario for NGC 3311, the brightest galaxy of the Hydra I cluster, a massive early-type galaxy with multiple structural components, including a low-velocity dispersion core and an extended stellar halo. We use MUSE observations to map the stellar populations of NGC 3311 out to 2 effective radii to trace its mass assembly back in time. Using a customized and extended version of the state-of-the-art single stellar population models EMILES, and a newly developed parametric fully Bayesian framework, we model the observed spectra using full-spectrum fitting and produce 2D maps of the stellar velocity dispersion, age, total metallicity, \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-element, sodium abundance, and the initial mass function (IMF) slope. The core, which we identify as a red nugget, dominates the light budget within \$R{\textbackslash}lesssim 1.5\$ kpc, has a relatively small velocity dispersion (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_*{\textbackslash}approx 180\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), is old (ages\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 11\$ Gyr), metal-rich ([Z/H]\${\textbackslash}sim0.2\$ and [Na/Fe]\${\textbackslash}sim0.4\$), and has a bottom-heavy IMF (with slope \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_b{\textbackslash}sim2.4\$). In the outer region, stars become increasingly hotter, younger, metal and sodium poorer, \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-element richer, and the IMF slope becomes Chabrier-like with increasing galactocentric distances. The multiple structural components in NGC 3311 confirm the expectations of the two-phase formation scenario for NGC 3311, where red nuggets are formed first in a very short, high-z star formation episode, and later grow in size by the extended mass assembly of satellites. Interestingly, the outer stellar population has an overabundant [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe], most likely because NGC 3311, located at the center of the galaxy cluster, accreted stars from rapidly quenched satellites.

With a resolution of 0.02", this radio image shows two kiloparsec-scale bipolar jets emanating from the active galactic nucleus of the Abell 85 BCG. The galaxy core appears as a single entity on the new radio map. It has been assumed that the Abell 85 BCG contained a binary black hole in its core. However, Chandra X-ray data and the new high-resolution radio map show no evidence that the Abell 85 BCG harbors a binary black hole. The assumption that this galaxy contains a binary black hole was based on the analysis of its optical surface brightness profile obtained under poor seeing conditions. We demonstrate how the well-known blurring effects of atmospheric seeing can mimic the effects of a binary supermassive black hole (SMBH). Likewise, SDSS J004150.75-091824.3 was postulated to be "a third" SMBH associated with the BCG.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11085},
	abstract = {AGN feedback is responsible for maintaining plasma in global thermal balance in extended halos of elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters. Local thermal instability in the hot gas leads to the formation of precipitating cold gas clouds that feed the central supermassive black holes, thus heating the hot gas and maintaining global thermal equilibrium. We perform three dimensional MHD simulations of self-regulated AGN feedback in a Perseus-like galaxy cluster with the aim of understanding the impact of the feedback physics on the turbulence properties of the hot and cold phases of the ICM. We find that, in general, the cold phase velocity structure function (VSF) is steeper than the prediction from Kolmogorov's theory. We attribute the physical origin of the steeper slope of the cold phase VSF to the driving of turbulent motions primarily by the gravitational acceleration acting on the ballistic clouds. We demonstrate that, in the pure hydrodynamical case, the precipitating cold filaments may be the dominant agent driving turbulence in the hot ICM. The arguments in favor of this hypothesis are that: (i) the cold phase mass dominates over hot gas mass in the inner cool core; (ii) hot and cold gas velocities are spatially correlated; (iii) both the cold and hot phase velocity distributions are radially biased. We show that, in the MHD case, the turbulence in the ambient hot medium (excluding the jet cone regions) can also be driven by the AGN jets. The driving is then facilitated by enhanced coupling due to magnetic fields of the ambient gas and the AGN jets. In the MHD case, turbulence may thus be driven by a combination of AGN jet stirring and filament motions. We conclude that future observations, including those from high spatial and spectral resolution X-ray missions, may help to constrain self-regulated AGN feedback by quantifying the multi-temperature VSF in the ICM.},

	abstract = {Self-interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) models have the potential to solve the small-scale problems that arise in the Cold Dark Matter paradigm. Simulations are a powerful tool for studying SIDM in the context of astrophysics, but it is numerically challenging to study differential cross-sections that favour small-angle scattering (as in light-mediator models). Here we present a novel approach to model frequent scattering based on an effective drag force, which we have implemented into the N-body code Gadget-3. In a range of test problems we demonstrate that our implementation accurately models frequent scattering. Our implementation can be used to study differences between SIDM models that predict rare and frequent scattering. We simulate core formation in isolated dark matter haloes, as well as major mergers of galaxy clusters. We find that SIDM models with rare and frequent interactions cannot be mapped onto one another. In particular, frequent interactions are able to produce larger offsets between the distribution of galaxies and dark matter in equal-mass mergers.},

By formulating the mass estimation problem within this simulation-based inference framework, we are able to quantify the uncertainties on the inferred masses in a straightforward and robust way. We generate a realistic mock catalogue emulating the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Legacy spectroscopic observations (the main galaxy sample) for redshifts \$z {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.09\$ and explicitly illustrate the challenges posed by interloper (non-member) galaxies for cluster mass estimation from actual observations. Our approach constitutes the first optimal machine learning-based exploitation of the information content of the full 3D projected phase-space distribution, including both the virialized and infall cluster regions, for the inference of dynamical cluster masses. We also present, for the first time, the application of a simulation-based inference machinery to obtain dynamical masses of around \$800\$ galaxy clusters found in the SDSS Legacy Survey, and show that the resulting mass estimates are consistent with mass measurements from the literature.},

Our results suggest that Kinetic Field Theory contains a complete resummation of Standard Perturbation Theory in this regime. We further show that the exact free-streaming solution of Kinetic Field Theory can not be recovered in any finite order of Standard Perturbation Theory.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02850},
	abstract = {Galaxy cluster outskirts are described by complex velocity fields induced by diffuse material collapsing towards filaments, gas and galaxies falling into clusters, and gas shock processes triggered by substructures. A simple scenario that describes the large-scale tidal fields of the cosmic web is not able to fully account for this variety, nor for the differences between gas and collisionless dark matter. We have studied the filamentary structure in zoom-in resimulations centred on 324 clusters from The ThreeHundred project, focusing on differences between dark and baryonic matter. This paper describes the properties of filaments around clusters out to five \$R\_\{200\}\$, based on the diffuse filament medium where haloes had been removed. For this, we stack the remaining particles of all simulated volumes to calculate the average profiles of dark matter and gas filaments. We find that filaments increase their thickness closer to nodes and detect signatures of gas turbulence at a distance of \${\textbackslash}sim 2 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}rm\{Mpc\}\$ from the cluster. These are absent in dark matter. Both gas and dark matter collapse towards filament spines at a rate of \${\textbackslash}sim 200 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}rm\{km {\textasciitilde} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\} \$. We see that gas preferentially enters the cluster as part of filaments, and leaves the cluster centre outside filaments. We further see evidence for an accretion shock just outside the cluster. For dark matter, this preference is less obvious. We argue that this difference is related to the turbulent environment. This indicates that filaments act as highways to fuel the inner regions of clusters with gas and galaxies.},

	abstract = {Exploring the power spectrum of fluctuations and velocities in the 
intracluster medium (ICM) can help us to probe the gas physics of galaxy
clusters. Using high-resolution 3D plasma simulations, we study the
statistics of the velocity field and its intimate relation with the ICM
thermodynamic perturbations. The normalization of the ICM spectrum
(related to density, entropy, or pressure fluctuations) is linearly tied
to the level of large-scale motions, which excite both gravity and sound
waves due to stratification. For a low 3D Mach number M {\textasciitilde} 0.25, gravity
waves mainly drive entropy perturbations, which are traced by
preferentially tangential turbulence. For M{\textgreater} 0.5, sound waves start
to significantly contribute and pass the leading role to compressive
pressure fluctuations, which are associated with isotropic (or slightly
radial) turbulence. Density and temperature fluctuations are then
characterized by the dominant process: isobaric (low M), adiabatic (high
M), or isothermal (strong conduction). Most clusters reside in the
intermediate regime, showing a mixture of gravity and sound waves, hence
drifting toward isotropic velocities. Remarkably, regardless of the
regime, the variance of density perturbations is comparable to the 1D
Mach number, M1D {\textasciitilde} δρ/ρ. This linear relation
allows us to easily convert between gas motions and ICM perturbations
(δρ/ρ{\textless} 1), which can be exploited by the available
Chandra, XMM data and by the forthcoming Astro-H mission. At
intermediate and small scales (10-100 kpc), the turbulent velocities
develop a tight Kolmogorov cascade. The thermodynamic perturbations
(which can be generally described by log-normal distributions) act as
effective tracers of the velocity field, in broad agreement with the
Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin advection theory. The cluster radial
gradients and compressive features induce a flattening in the cascade of
the perturbations. Thermal conduction, on the other hand, acts to damp
the thermodynamic fluctuations, washing out the filamentary structures
and steepening the spectrum, while leaving the velocity cascade
unaltered. The ratio of the velocity and density spectrum thus inverts
the downtrend shown by the non-diffusive models, as it widens up to {\textasciitilde}5.
This new key diagnostic can robustly probe the presence of conductivity
in the ICM. We produce X-ray images of the velocity field, showing how
future missions (e.g. Astro-H, Athena) can detect velocity dispersions
of a few 100 km s-1 (M{\textgreater} 0.1 in massive clusters), allowing
us to calibrate the linear relation and to constrain relative
perturbations down to just a few percent.},

In particular, we investigate the scaling relations between mass, luminosity and temperature of galaxy groups and clusters in the absence of radiative processes. Theoretical expectations are derived from a polytropic model of the intracluster medium and compared with the results of high-resolution adiabatic gasdynamical simulations. It is shown that, in addition to the well-known relation between the mass and concentration of the dark matter halo, the effective polytropic index of the gas also varies systematically with cluster mass, and therefore neither the dark matter nor the gas profiles are exactly self-similar. It is remarkable, though, that the effects of concentration and polytropic index tend to cancel each other, leading to scaling relations whose logarithmic slopes roughly match the predictions of the most basic self-similar models. We provide a phenomenological fit to the relation between polytropic index and concentration, as well as a self-consistent scheme to derive the non-linear scaling relations expected for any cosmology and the best-fit normalizations of the M-T, L-T and F-T relations appropriate for a Lambda-CDM universe. The predicted scaling relations reproduce observational data reasonably well for massive clusters, where the effects of cooling and star formation are expected to play a minor role.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02001},
	abstract = {Radio relics in galaxy clusters are extended synchrotron sources produced by cosmic-ray electrons in the \${\textbackslash}mu\$G magnetic field. Many relics are found in the cluster periphery and have a cluster-centric, narrow arc-like shape, which suggests that the electrons are accelerated or re-accelerated by merger shock fronts propagating outward in the intracluster plasma. In the X-ray, some relics do exhibit such shocks at the location of the relic, but many do not. We explore the possibility that radio relics trace not the shock fronts but the shape of the underlying distribution of seed relativistic electrons, lit up by a recent shock passage. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations of cluster mergers and include bubbles of relativistic electrons injected by jets from the central AGN or from an off-center radio galaxy. We show that the merger-driven gas motions (a) can advect the bubble cosmic rays to very large radii, and (b) spread the relativistic seed electrons preferentially in tangential direction -- along the gravitational equipotential surfaces -- producing extended, filamentary or sheet-like regions of intracluster plasma enriched with aged cosmic rays, which resemble radio relics. Once a shock front passes across such a region, the sharp radio emission edges would trace the sharp boundaries of these enriched regions rather than the front. We also show that these elongated cosmic ray features are naturally associated with magnetic fields stretched tangentially along their long axis, which could help explain the high polarization of relics.},

The program is complemented by the ClusterGEN code, capable of producing mock galaxy clusters under the assumption of spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium. The code is written in Fortran and we plan to make it publicly available. Its technical aspects will be presented elsewhere. We demonstrate the potential of the method in an ideal situation by analysing a set of synthetic, isolated and spherically-symmetric dark matter halos, focusing on the statistical degeneracies between model parameters.

	abstract = {The study of velocity fields of the hot gas in galaxy clusters can help to unravel details of microphysics on small-scales and to decipher the nature of feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Likewise, magnetic fields as traced by Faraday rotation measurements (RMs) inform about their impact on gas dynamics as well as on cosmic ray production and transport. We investigate the inherent relationship between large-scale gas kinematics and magnetic fields through non-radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the creation, evolution and disruption of AGN jet-inflated lobes in an isolated Perseus-like galaxy cluster, with and without pre-existing turbulence. In particular, we connect cluster velocity measurements with mock RM maps to highlight their underlying physical connection, which opens up the possibility of comparing turbulence levels in two different observables. For single jet outbursts, we find only a local impact on the velocity field, i.e. the associated increase in velocity dispersion is not volume-filling. Furthermore, in a setup with pre-existing turbulence, this increase in velocity dispersion is largely hidden. We use mock X-ray observations to show that at arcmin resolution, the velocity dispersion is therefore dominated by existing large-scale turbulence and is only minimally altered by the presence of a jet. For the velocity structure of central gas uplifted by buoyantly rising lobes, we find fast, coherent outflows with low velocity dispersion. Our results highlight that projected velocity distributions show complex structures which pose challenges for the interpretation of observations.},

	abstract = {Radio synchrotron emission from the bridges of low-density gas connecting galaxy clusters and groups is a challenge for particle acceleration processes. In this work, we analyse the Coma radio bridge using new LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) observations at 144 MHz. LOFAR detects the bridge and its substructures with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. We find that the radio emission peaks on the NGC 4839 group. Towards the halo, in front of the NGC 4839 group, the radio brightness decreases and streams of radio emission connect the NGC 4839 group to the radio relic. Using X-ray observations, we find that thermal and non-thermal plasma are moderately correlated with a sub-linear scaling. We use archival radio data at 326 MHz to constrain the spectral index in the bridge, and quantify the distribution of particles and magnetic field at different frequencies. We find that the spectrum is steeper than \$-1.4 {\textbackslash}pm 0.2\$, and that the emission could be clumpier at 326 MHz than at 144 MHz. Using cosmological simulations and a simplified approach to compute particle acceleration, we derive under which conditions turbulent acceleration of mildly relativistic electrons could generate the radio emission in the bridge. Assuming that the initial energy ratio of the seed electrons is \$3 {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ with respect to the thermal gas, we are able to reproduce the observed luminosity. Our results suggest that the seed electrons released by radiogalaxies in the bridge and the turbulence generated by the motion of gas and galaxies are essential to produce the radio emission.},

	abstract = {We explore stellar population properties separately in the bulge and the disk of double-component cluster galaxies to shed light on the formation of lenticular galaxies in dense environments. We study eight low-redshift clusters from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field (SAMI) Galaxy Survey, using 2D photometric bulge-disk decomposition in the \$g\$, \$r\$ and \$i\$-bands to characterize galaxies. For 192 double-component galaxies with \$M\_\{*\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{10{\textasciitilde}\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ we estimate the color, age and metallicity of the bulge and the disk. The analysis of the \$g-i\$ colors reveals that bulges are redder than their surrounding disks with a median offset of 0.12\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.02 mag, consistent with previous results. To measure mass-weighted age and metallicity we investigate three methods: (i) one based on galaxy stellar mass weights for the two components, (ii) one based on flux weights and (iii) one based on radial separation. The three methods agree in finding 62\% of galaxies having bulges that are 2-3 times more metal-rich than the disks. Of the remaining galaxies, 7\% have bulges that are more metal-poor than the disks, while for 31\% the bulge and disk metallicities are not significantly different. We observe 23\% of galaxies being characterized by bulges older and 34\% by bulges younger with respect to the disks. The remaining 43\% of galaxies have bulges and disks with statistically indistinguishable ages. Redder bulges tend to be more metal-rich than the disks, suggesting that the redder color in bulges is due to their enhanced metallicity relative to the disks instead of differences in stellar population age.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03264},
	abstract = {The nature of the intense X-ray emission from powerful extragalactic jets at large (\${\textgreater}1\$ kpc) scale is still debated. The scenario that invokes the inverse Compton scattering of the CMB by electrons is challenged by the lack of gamma-ray emission in the GeV band. An alternative assumes synchrotron emission by a distinct population of ultra-high energy electrons. Here we present a concrete attempt to apply this scenario, exploring the specific model in which the ultra-high energy electrons are accelerated in a shear layer surrounding the jet. We limit the study to non-relativistic flows and particle acceleration is treated by a Fokker-Planck equation. The strict spatial coincidence between low energy (radio, optical) and X-ray emission prompts us to assume that the required population of pre-accelerated particles is provided by a shock responsible for the acceleration of the electrons emitting at low frequencies. We apply the model to the emission of the principal knots of the jets of PKS 0637-752 and PKS 1136-135, two of the best studied objects. For the set of fiducial parameters adopted, the condition that the jet power does not exceeds a limiting value of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{48\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ constrains the magnetic field above \$10\$ \${\textbackslash}mu\$G and indicates moderate beaming (\${\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash}simeq 2\$) for PKS 0637-752. For both sources, the requirement that acceleration of the electrons proceeds faster than radiative cooling can be met if the magnetic turbulence in the shear layer follows a Kolmogorov spectrum, \$I(k){\textbackslash}propto k{\textasciicircum}\{-q\}\$ with \$q=5/3\$, but cannot satisfied in the Bohm-like case (\$q=1\$).},

	abstract = {An overview is presented of the main properties of the interstellar medium. Evidence is summarized that the interstellar medium is highly turbulent, driven on different length scales by various energetic processes. Large-scale turbulence determines the formation of structures like filaments and shells in the diffuse interstellar medium. It also regulates the formation of dense, cold molecular clouds. Molecular clouds are now believed to be transient objects that form on timescales of order 107yrs in regions where HI gas is compressed and cools. Supersonic turbulence in the compressed HI slab is generated by a combination of hydrodynamical instabilities, coupled with cooling. Turbulent dissipation is compensated by the kinetic energy input of the inflow. Molecular hydrogen eventually forms when the surface density in the slab reaches a threshold value of ∼1021cm−2 at which point further cooling triggers the onset of star formation by gravitational collapse. A few Myrs later, the newly formed stars and resulting supernovae will disperse their molecular surrounding and generate new expanding shells that drive again turbulence in the diffuse gas and trigger the formation of a next generation of cold clouds. Although a consistent scenario of interstellar medium dynamics and star formation is emerging many details are still unclear and require more detailed work on microphysical processes as well as a better understanding of supersonic, compressible turbulence.

Résumé
Les propriétés principales du milieu interstellaire sont présentées. Les preuves sont réunies pour montrer que le milieu interstellaire est hautement turbulent, et que l'énergie lui est fournie à différentes échelles par divers processus. La turbulence à grande échelle détermine la formation des structures, comme les filaments et coquilles du milieu interstellaire diffus. Elle régule aussi la formation des nuages moléculaires froids et denses. Les nuages moléculaires sont considérés aujourd'hui comme des objets transitoires qui se forment sur des échelles de temps de 107ans, dans des régions où le gaz HI est comprimé et se refroidit. La turbulence supersonique dans la couche HI comprimée est engendrée par une combinaison d'instabilités hydrodynamiques et de refroidissement. La dissipation turbulente est compensée par l'apport d'énergie cinétique du flux de gaz. Enfin l'hydrogène moléculaire se forme, lorsque la densité de surface dans la couche atteint le seuil de ∼1021cm−2 ; alors le refroidissement déclenche la formation d'étoiles par effondrement gravitationnel. Quelques millions d'années plus tard, les nouvelles étoiles formées et les explosions de supernovae qui en résultent dispersent le milieu moléculaire environnant, et engendrent de nouvelles bulles en expansion, qui à nouveau créent de la turbulence dans le gaz diffus, et déclenchent la formation d'une nouvelle génération de nuages froids. Bien qu'un scénario cohérent de la dynamique du milieu interstellaire et de la formation d'étoiles émerge, bien des détails sont encore obscurs, et demandent plus de travail sur les processus microphysiques, et aussi une meilleure compréhension de la turbulence supersonique et compressible.

This study, which utilizes new, deep data from Chandra and Hubble, along with ground-based spectroscopy from Gemini and Magellan, improves significantly on previous studies in both depth and angular resolution, allowing us to directly compare to clusters at z{\textasciitilde}0. We find that the temperature, density, and entropy profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM) are very similar among the four clusters, and share similar shapes to clusters at z{\textasciitilde}0. Specifically, we find no evidence for deviations from self similarity in the temperature profile over the radial range 10kpc {\textless} r {\textless} 1Mpc, implying that the processes responsible for preventing runaway cooling over the past {\textgreater}6 Gyr are, at least roughly, preserving self similarity. We find typical metallicities of {\textasciitilde}0.3 Zsun in the bulk of the ICM, rising to {\textasciitilde}0.5 Zsun in the inner {\textasciitilde}100 kpc, and reaching {\textasciitilde}1 Zsun at r {\textless} 10kpc. This central excess is similar in magnitude to what is observed in the most relaxed clusters at z{\textasciitilde}0, suggesting that both the global metallicity and the central excess that we see in cool core clusters at z{\textasciitilde}0 were in place very early in the cluster lifetime and, specifically, that the central excess is not due to late-time enrichment by the central galaxy. Consistent with observations at z{\textasciitilde}0, we measure a diversity of stellar populations in the central brightest cluster galaxies of these four clusters, with star formation rates spanning a factor of {\textasciitilde}500, despite the similarity in cooling time, cooling rate, and central entropy. These data suggest that, while the details vary dramatically from system to system, runaway cooling has been broadly regulated in relaxed clusters over the past 6 Gyr.},

	abstract = {Methods. Using proﬁles of the gas temperature, density, and pressure that have been spatially resolved out to median values of 0.9R500, 1.8R500, and 2.3R500, respectively, we are able to recover the hydrostatic gravitating mass proﬁle with several methods and using diﬀerent mass models.
Results. The hydrostatic masses are recovered with a relative (statistical) median error of 3\% at R500 and 6\% at R200. By using several diﬀerent methods to solve the equation of the hydrostatic equilibrium, we evaluate some of the systematic uncertainties to be of the order of 5\% at both R500 and R200. A Navarro-Frenk-White proﬁle provides the best-ﬁt in 9 cases out of 13; the remaining 4 cases do not show a statistically signiﬁcant tension with it. The distribution of the mass concentration follows the correlations with the total mass predicted from numerical simulations with a scatter of 0.18 dex, with an intrinsic scatter on the hydrostatic masses of 0.15 dex. We compare them with the estimates of the total gravitational mass obtained through X-ray scaling relations applied to YX, gas fraction, and YS Z, and from weak lensing and galaxy dynamics techniques, and measure a substantial agreement with the results from scaling laws, from WL at both R500 and R200 (with diﬀerences below 15\%), from cluster velocity dispersions. Instead, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant tension with the caustic masses that tend to underestimate the hydrostatic masses by 40\% at R200. We also compare these measurements with predictions from alternative models to the cold dark matter, like the emergent gravity and MOND scenarios, conﬁrming that the latter underestimates hydrostatic masses by 40\% at R1000, with a decreasing tension as the radius increases, and reaches ∼15\% at R200, whereas the former reproduces M500 within 10\%, but overestimates M200 by about 20\%.
Conclusions. The unprecedented accuracy of these hydrostatic mass proﬁles out to R200 allows us to assess the level of systematic errors in the hydrostatic mass reconstruction method, to evaluate the intrinsic scatter in the NFW c − M relation, and to robustly quantify diﬀerences among diﬀerent mass models, diﬀerent mass proxies, and diﬀerent gravity scenarios.},

We present JoXSZ, the ﬁrst publicly available code designed to jointly ﬁt SZ and X-ray data coming from various instruments to derive the thermodynamic proﬁles of galaxy clusters. JoXSZ follows a fully Bayesian forward-modelling approach, accounts for the SZ calibration uncertainty, and for the X-ray background level systematic. It improves upon most current and not publicly available analyses because it adopts the correct Poisson-Gauss expression for the joint likelihood, makes full use of the information contained in the observations, even in the case of missing values within the datasets, has a more inclusive error budget, and adopts a consistent temperature in the various parts of the code, allowing for diﬀerences between X-ray and SZ gas-mass weighted temperatures when required by the user. JoXSZ accounts for beam smearing and data analysis transfer function, accounts for the temperature and metallicity dependencies of the SZ and X-ray conversion factors, adopts ﬂexible parametrisation for the thermodynamic proﬁles, and on user request, allows either adopting or relaxing the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE). When HE holds, JoXSZ uses a physical (positive) prior on the radial derivative of the enclosed mass and derives the mass proﬁle and overdensity radii r∆. For these reasons, JoXSZ goes beyond simple SZ and electron density ﬁts. We illustrate the use of JoXSZ by combining Chandra and NIKA data of the high-redshift cluster CL J1226.9+3332. The code is written in Python, it is fully documented, and the users are free to customise their analysis in accordance with their needs and requirements. JoXSZ is publicly available on GitHub.},

Combining all cluster observables in a consistent way will help us to understand their global properties and their internal structure. Aims. We provide proof of the concept that the projected gravitational potential of galaxy clusters can directly be reconstructed from X-ray observations. We also show that this joint analysis can be used to locally test the validity of the equilibrium assumptions in galaxy clusters. Methods. We used a newly developed reconstruction method, based on Richardson-Lucy deprojection, that allows reconstructing projected gravitational potentials of galaxy clusters directly from X-ray observations. We applied this algorithm to the well-studied cluster Abell 1689 and compared the gravitational potential reconstructed from X-ray observables to the potential obtained from gravitational lensing measurements. [...] Results. Assuming spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium, the potentials recovered from gravitational lensing and from X-ray emission agree very well beyond 500 kpc. Owing to the fact that the Richardson-Lucy deprojection algorithm allows deprojecting each line of sight independently, this result may indicate that non-gravitational effects and/or asphericity are strong in the central regions of the clusters. Conclusions. We demonstrate the robustness of the potential reconstruction method based on the Richardson-Lucy deprojection algorithm and show that gravitational lensing and X-ray emission lead to consistent gravitational potentials. Our results illustrate the power of combining galaxy-cluster observables in a single, non-parametric, joint reconstruction of consistent cluster potentials that can be used to locally constrain the physical state of the gas.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, galaxy clusters have been expected to retain all the material accreted since their formation epoch. For this reason, their matter content should be representative of the Universe as a whole, and thus their baryon fraction should be close to the Universal baryon fraction Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}b{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/ Ω{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. We make use of the sample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to investigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the cluster population. Since it spans a wide range of mass (10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}−10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}15{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) and redshift (0.05−1.1) and benefits from a large set of multiwavelength data, the XXL-100-GC sample is ideal for measuring the global baryon budget of massive halos. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a mass-temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements for a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the weak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially lower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses. Our best-fit relation between gas fraction and mass reads {\textless}i{\textgreater}f{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}gas,500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.055{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-0.006{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+0.007{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}14{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}){\textless}sup{\textgreater}0.21{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-0.10{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+0.11{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. The baryon budget of galaxy clusters therefore falls short of the Universal baryon fraction by about a factor of two at {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}500,MT{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. Our measurements require a hydrostatic bias 1−{\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}WL{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.72{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-0.07{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+0.08{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} to match the gas fraction obtained using lensing and hydrostatic equilibrium, which holds independently of the instrument considered. Comparing our gas fraction measurements with the expectations from numerical simulations, we find that our results favour an extreme feedback scheme in which a significant fraction of the baryons are expelled from the cores of halos. This model is, however, in contrast with the thermodynamical properties of observed halos, which might suggest that weak-lensing masses are overestimated. In light of these results, we note that a mass bias 1−{\textless}i{\textgreater}b{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.58 as required to reconcile {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck {\textless}i/{\textgreater}cosmic microwave background and cluster counts should translate into an even lower baryon fraction, which poses a major challenge to our current understanding of galaxy clusters.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of spatially-extended, non-thermal-like emission components in Chandra X-ray spectra for five of a sample of seven massive, merging galaxy clusters with powerful radio halos. The emission components can be fitted by power-law models with mean photon indices in the range 1.5 {\textless} Gamma {\textless} 2.0. A control sample of regular, dynamically relaxed clusters, without radio halos but with comparable mean thermal temperatures and luminosities, shows no compelling evidence for similar components. Detailed X-ray spectral mapping reveals the complex thermodynamic states of the radio halo clusters. Our deepest observations, of the Bullet Cluster 1E 0657-56, demonstrate a spatial correlation between the strongest power-law X-ray emission, highest thermal pressure, and brightest 1.34GHz radio halo emission in this cluster. We confirm the presence of a shock front in the 1E 0657-56 and report the discovery of a new, large-scale shock front in Abell 2219. We explore possible origins for the power-law X-ray components. These include inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by relativistic electrons in the clusters; bremsstrahlung from supra-thermal electrons energized by Coulomb collisions with an energetic, nonthermal proton population; and synchrotron emission associated with ultra-relativistic electrons. Interestingly, we show that the power-law signatures may also be due to complex temperature and/or metallicity structure in clusters particularly in the presence of metallicity gradients. In this case, an important distinguishing characteristic between the radio halo clusters and control sample of predominantly cool-core clusters is the relatively low central X-ray surface brightness of the former.},

	abstract = {Cette thèse est consacrée au développement d'un modèle End-to-End pour le spectrocalorimètre X-IFU qui observera à partir de 2028 l'Univers en rayons X avec une précision jamais atteinte auparavant. Ce travail s'est essentiellement organisé en deux parties. J'ai dans un premier temps étudié la dynamique des parties les plus internes des binaires X de faible masse à l'aide de deux sondes particulières que sont les sursauts X et les oscillations quasi-périodiques au kHz (kHz QPOs). En me basant sur les données d'archive du satellite Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer et sur des méthodes d'analyse spécifiquement développées dans ce but, j'ai notamment pu mettre en évidence pour la première fois une réaction du premier sur le second, confirmant le lien très  étroit entre ces oscillations et les parties les plus internes du système. Le temps de rétablissement du système suite aux sursauts entre  également en conflit dans la plupart des cas avec l'augmentation supposée du taux d'accrétion suite à ces explosions. Au travers d'une analyse spectro-temporelle complète  des deux kHz QPOs de 4U 1728-34, j'ai également pu confirmer l'incompatibilité des spectres de retard des deux QPOs qui suggère une origine différente de ces deux oscillations. L'étude de leurs spectres de covariance, obtenus pour la première fois dans cette thèse, a quant à elle mis en évidence le rôle central de la couche de Comptonisation et potentiellement celui d'une zone particulièrement compacte de la couche limite pour l'émission des QPOs. Dans le second volet de ma thèse, j'ai développé un simulateur End-to-End pour l'instrument X-IFU  permettant de représenter l'ensemble du processus menant à une observation scientifique en rayons X, de l'émission des photons par une source jusqu'à leur mesure finale à bord du satellite. J'ai notamment mis en place des outils permettant la comparaison précise de plusieurs matrices de détecteurs en prenant en compte les effets de la reconstruction du signal brut issu des électroniques de lecture. Cette étude a mis en évidence l'intérêt de configurations hybrides, contenant une sous-matrice de petits pixels capables d'améliorer par un ordre de grandeur la capacité de comptage de l'instrument. Une solution alternative consisterait à défocaliser le miroir lors de l'observation de sources ponctuelles brillantes. Situées au coeur de la performance du X-IFU, j'ai également comparé de manière exhaustive différentes méthodes de reconstruction des signaux bruts issus des détecteurs X-IFU. Ceci a permis de montrer qu'à faible coût en termes de puissance de calcul embarquée, une amélioration significative de la résolution en énergie finale de l'instrument pouvait  être obtenue à l'aide d'algorithmes plus sophistiqués. En tenant compte des contraintes de calibration, le candidat le plus prometteur apparaît aujourd'hui être l'analyse dans l'espace de résistance. En me servant de la caractérisation des performances des différents types de pixels, j'ai également mis en place une méthode de simulation rapide et modulable de l'ensemble de l'instrument permettant d'obtenir des observations synthétiques à long temps d'exposition de sources X très complexes, représentatives des futures capacités du X-IFU. Cet outil m'a notamment permis d'étudier la sensibilité de cet instrument aux effets de temps mort et de confusion, mais également d'estimer sa future capacité à distinguer différents régimes de turbulence dans les amas de galaxies et de mesurer leur profil d'abondance et de température. A plus long terme ce simulateur pourra servir à l'étude d'autres cas scientifiques, ainsi qu'à l'analyse d'effets à l'échelle de l'ensemble du plan de détection tels que la diaphonie entre pixels.},

	abstract = {Uninhibited radiative cooling in clusters of galaxies would lead to excessive mass accretion rates contrary to observations. One of the key proposals to offset radiative energy losses is thermal conduction from outer, hotter layers of cool core (CC) clusters to their centers. However, thermal conduction is sensitive to magnetic field topology. In CC clusters where temperature decreases inwards, the heat buoyancy instability (HBI) leads to magnetic fields ordered preferentially in the direction perpendicular to that of gravity, which significantly reduces the level of conduction below the classical Spitzer-Braginskii value. However, the CC clusters are rarely in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Sloshing motions due to minor mergers and stirring motions induced by cluster galaxies or active galactic nuclei can significantly perturb the gas. The turbulent cascade can then affect the topology of the magnetic field and the effective level of thermal conduction. We perform three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the effect of turbulence on the properties of the anisotropic thermal conduction in CC clusters. We show that very weak subsonic motions, well within observational constraints, can randomize the magnetic field and significantly boost effective thermal conduction beyond the saturated values expected in the pure unperturbed HBI case. We find that the turbulent motions can essentially restore the conductive heat flow to the CC to level comparable to the theoretical maximum of ∼1/3 Spitzer for a highly tangled field. Runs with radiative cooling show that the cooling catastrophe can be averted and the cluster core stabilized; however, this conclusion may depend on the central gas density. Above a critical Froude number, these same turbulent motions also eliminate the tangential bias in the velocity and magnetic field that is otherwise induced by the trapped g-modes, and possibly allow significant turbulent heat diffusion. Our results can be tested with future radio polarization measurements and have implications for efficient metal dispersal in clusters.},

	abstract = {We present Hitomi observations of N132D, a young, X-ray bright, O-rich core-collapse supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Despite a very short observation of only 3.7 ks, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) easily detects the line complexes of highly ionized S K and Fe K with 16-17 counts in each. The Fe feature is measured for the first time at high spectral resolution. Based on the plausible assumption that the Fe K emission is dominated by He-like ions, we find that the material responsible for this Fe emission is highly redshifted at {\textasciitilde}800 km/s compared to the local LMC interstellar medium (ISM), with a 90\% credible interval of 50-1500 km/s if a weakly informative prior is placed on possible line broadening. This indicates (1) that the Fe emission arises from the supernova ejecta, and (2) that these ejecta are highly asymmetric, since no blue-shifted component is found. The S K velocity is consistent with the local LMC ISM, and is likely from swept-up ISM material. These results are consistent with spatial mapping that shows the He-like Fe concentrated in the interior of the remnant and the S tracing the outer shell. The results also show that even with a very small number of counts, direct velocity measurements from Doppler-shifted lines detected in extended objects like supernova remnants are now possible. Thanks to the very low SXS background of {\textasciitilde}1 event per spectral resolution element per 100 ks, such results are obtainable during short pointed or slew observations with similar instruments. This highlights the power of high-spectral-resolution imaging observations, and demonstrates the new window that has been opened with Hitomi and will be greatly widened with future missions such as the X-ray Astronomy Recovery Mission (XARM) and Athena.},

	abstract = {The Hitomi SXS spectrum of the Perseus cluster, with \${\textbackslash}sim\$5 eV resolution in the 2-9 keV band, offers an unprecedented benchmark of the atomic modeling and database for hot collisional plasmas. It reveals both successes and challenges of the current atomic codes. The latest versions of AtomDB/APEC (3.0.8), SPEX (3.03.00), and CHIANTI (8.0) all provide reasonable fits to the broad-band spectrum, and are in close agreement on best-fit temperature, emission measure, and abundances of a few elements such as Ni. For the Fe abundance, the APEC and SPEX measurements differ by 16\%, which is 17 times higher than the statistical uncertainty. This is mostly attributed to the differences in adopted collisional excitation and dielectronic recombination rates of the strongest emission lines. We further investigate and compare the sensitivity of the derived physical parameters to the astrophysical source modeling and instrumental effects. The Hitomi results show that an accurate atomic code is as important as the astrophysical modeling and instrumental calibration aspects. Substantial updates of atomic databases and targeted laboratory measurements are needed to get the current codes ready for the data from the next Hitomi-level mission.},

	abstract = {Thanks to its high spectral resolution ({\textasciitilde}5 eV at 6 keV), the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) on board Hitomi enables us to measure the detailed structure of spatially resolved emission lines from highly ionized ions in galaxy clusters for the first time. In this series of papers, using the SXS we have measured the velocities of gas motions, metallicities and the multi-temperature structure of the gas in the core of the Perseus cluster. Here, we show that when inferring physical properties from line emissivities in systems like Perseus, the resonant scattering (RS) effect should be taken into account. In the Hitomi waveband, RS mostly affects the FeXXV He\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line (\$w\$) - the strongest line in the spectrum. The flux measured by Hitomi in this line is suppressed by a factor {\textasciitilde}1.3 in the inner {\textasciitilde}30 kpc, compared to predictions for an optically thin plasma; the suppression decreases with the distance from the center. The \$w\$ line also appears slightly broader than other lines from the same ion. The observed distortions of the \$w\$ line flux, shape and distance dependence are all consistent with the expected effect of the resonant scattering in the Perseus core. By measuring the ratio of fluxes in optically thick (\$w\$) and thin (FeXXV forbidden, He\${\textbackslash}beta\$, Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$) lines, and comparing these ratios with predictions from Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, the velocities of gas motions have been obtained. The results are consistent with the direct measurements of gas velocities from line broadening described elsewhere in this series, although the systematic and statistical uncertainties remain significant. Further improvements in the predictions of line emissivities in plasma models, and deeper observations with future X-ray missions will enable RS measurements to provide powerful constraints on the amplitude and anisotropy of clusters gas motions.},

	abstract = {The present paper investigates the temperature structure of the X-ray emitting plasma in the core of the Perseus cluster using the 1.8--20.0 keV data obtained with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) onboard the Hitomi Observatory. A series of four observations were carried out, with a total effective exposure time of 338 ks and covering a central region \${\textbackslash}sim7'\$ in diameter. The SXS was operated with an energy resolution of \${\textbackslash}sim\$5 eV (full width at half maximum) at 5.9 keV. Not only fine structures of K-shell lines in He-like ions but also transitions from higher principal quantum numbers are clearly resolved from Si through Fe. This enables us to perform temperature diagnostics using the line ratios of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, and to provide the first direct measurement of the excitation temperature and ionization temperature in the Perseus cluster. The observed spectrum is roughly reproduced by a single temperature thermal plasma model in collisional ionization equilibrium, but detailed line ratio diagnostics reveal slight deviations from this approximation. In particular, the data exhibit an apparent trend of increasing ionization temperature with increasing atomic mass, as well as small differences between the ionization and excitation temperatures for Fe, the only element for which both temperatures can be measured. The best-fit two-temperature models suggest a combination of 3 and 5 keV gas, which is consistent with the idea that the observed small deviations from a single temperature approximation are due to the effects of projection of the known radial temperature gradient in the cluster core along the line of sight. Comparison with the Chandra/ACIS and the XMM-Newton/RGS results on the other hand suggests that additional lower-temperature components are present in the ICM but not detectable by Hitomi SXS given its 1.8--20 keV energy band.},

	abstract = {Extending the earlier measurements reported in Hitomi collaboration (2016, Nature, 535, 117), we examine the atmospheric gas motions within the central 100{\textasciitilde}kpc of the Perseus cluster using observations obtained with the Hitomi satellite. After correcting for the point spread function of the telescope and using optically thin emission lines, we find that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the hot gas is remarkably low and mostly uniform. The velocity dispersion reaches maxima of approximately 200{\textasciitilde}km{\textasciitilde}s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ toward the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) and toward the AGN inflated north-western `ghost' bubble. Elsewhere within the observed region, the velocity dispersion appears constant around 100{\textasciitilde}km{\textasciitilde}s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We also detect a velocity gradient with a 100{\textasciitilde}km{\textasciitilde}s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ amplitude across the cluster core, consistent with large-scale sloshing of the core gas. If the observed gas motions are isotropic, the kinetic pressure support is less than 10{\textbackslash}\% of the thermal pressure support in the cluster core. The well-resolved optically thin emission lines have Gaussian shapes, indicating that the turbulent driving scale is likely below 100{\textasciitilde}kpc, which is consistent with the size of the AGN jet inflated bubbles. We also report the first measurement of the ion temperature in the intracluster medium, which we find to be consistent with the electron temperature. In addition, we present a new measurement of the redshift to the brightest cluster galaxy NGC{\textasciitilde}1275.},

In the mixing-heating mechanism the ICM is heated by mixing of hot bubble gas with the ICM. This mixing is caused by vortices that are formed during the inflation process of the bubble. Sound waves and turbulence are also excited by the vortices, but they contribute less than 20 per cents to the heating of the ICM. Shocks that are excited by the jets contribute even less.},

Our analysis of these observations shows a smooth radial gradient of the [N II]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$6583/\${\textbackslash}text\{H\} {\textbackslash}alpha\$ line ratio, suggesting a change in the ionization mechanism and source across the nebula, while the dispersion profile shows a general decrease with increasing distance from the AGN at up to \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ kpc. The velocity map shows no visible general trend or rotation, indicating that filaments are not falling uniformly onto the galaxy, nor being pulled out from it.

The maximum energy density in turbulent motions on that scale is therefore low. If dissipated as heat the turbulent energy will be radiated away in less than 80 Myr and cannot spread across the core. A higher velocity is needed to prevent a cooling collapse. Gravity waves are shown to travel too slowly in a radial direction. Here we investigate propagation of energy by sound waves. The energy travels at about 1000 km/s and can cross the core in a cooling time. We show that the displacement velocity amplitude of the gas required to carry the power is consistent with the Hitomi result and that the inferred density and temperature variations are consistent with Chandra observations.},

The {\textbackslash}emph\{Hitomi\} spectrum -- which involves the sum of diffuse cluster emission and the point-like central Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) -- does not show any excess at \$E {\textbackslash}sim 3.5 \{{\textbackslash}rm keV\}\$, giving an apparent inconsistency with previous observations of excess diffuse emission. We point out that 2009 {\textbackslash}emph\{Chandra\} data reveals a strong dip in the AGN spectrum at \$E = (3.54 {\textbackslash}pm 0.02) \{{\textbackslash}rm keV\}\$ (cluster frame) -- the identical energy to the diffuse excess observed by {\textbackslash}emph\{XMM-Newton\}.

	abstract = {High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with Hitomi was expected to resolve the origin of the faint unidentified E=3.5 keV emission line reported in several low-resolution studies of various massive systems, such as galaxies and clusters, including the Perseus cluster. We have analyzed the Hitomi first-light observation of the Perseus cluster. The emission line expected for Perseus based on the XMM-Newton signal from the large cluster sample under the dark matter decay scenario is too faint to be detectable in the Hitomi data. However, the previously reported 3.5 keV flux from Perseus was anomalously high compared to the sample-based prediction. We find no unidentified line at the reported high flux level. Taking into account the XMM measurement uncertainties for this region, the inconsistency with Hitomi is at a 99\% significance for a broad dark-matter line and at 99.7\% for a narrow line from the gas. We do not find anomalously high fluxes of the nearby faint K line or the Ar satellite line that were proposed as explanations for the earlier 3.5 keV detections. We do find a hint of a broad excess near the energies of high-n transitions of Sxvi (E=3.44 keV rest-frame) -- a possible signature of charge exchange in the molecular nebula and another proposed explanation for the unidentified line. While its energy is consistent with XMM pn detections, it is unlikely to explain the MOS signal. A confirmation of this interesting feature has to wait for a more sensitive observation with a future calorimeter experiment.},

We model the relations between radius, gas temperature, density and pressure using a combination of power-laws, also evaluating the intrinsic scatter in these relations. We show that the gas pressure is remarkably well correlated to the density, with very small scatter. Also, the temperature correlates with gas density with similar scatter. The slopes of these relations have values that show a clear transition from the inner cluster regions to the outskirts. This transition occurs at the radius \$r\_t = 0.19({\textbackslash}pm0.04)R\_\{500\}\$ and electron density \$n\_t = (1.91{\textbackslash}pm0.21){\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} E{\textasciicircum}2 (z)\$. We find that above 0.2 \$R\_\{500\}\$ the radial thermodynamic profiles are accurately reproduced by a well defined and physically motivated framework, where the dark matter follows the NFW potential and the gas is represented by a polytropic equation of state. By modeling the gas temperature dependence upon both the gas density and radius, we propose a new method to reconstruct the hydrostatic mass profile based only on the quite inexpensive measurement of the gas density profile.},

A high-resolution numerical simulation of X-ray cluster formation by Norman and Bryan predicts cluster-wide turbulence with v\_turb {\textasciitilde} 300-600 {\textasciitilde}km/s and eddy scales l\_outer {\textasciitilde} 100-500 kpc, the larger numbers being characteristic of turbulence near the virial radius, while the smaller numbers pertain to the core. The simulation also predicts the existence of ordered bulk flows in the core with v {\textasciitilde} 400 km/s on scales of several hundred kpc. In this paper we consider the observability of such fluid motions via the distortions it induces in the CMB via the kinematic SZ effect, as well as via Doppler broadening and shifting of metal lines in the X-ray spectrum.

	abstract = {Future X-ray observations of galaxy clusters by high spectral resolution missions will provide spatially resolved measurements of the energy and width for the brightest emission lines in the intracluster medium (ICM) spectrum. In this paper we discuss various ways of using these high-resolution data to constrain velocity power spectrum in galaxy clusters. We argue that variations of these quantities with the projected distance R in cool core clusters contain important information on the velocity ﬁeld length scales (i.e. the size of energy-containing eddies) in the ICM. The effective length leff along the line of sight, which provides dominant contribution to the line ﬂux, increases with R, allowing one to probe the amplitude of the velocity variations at different spatial scales. In particular, we show that the width of the line as a function of R is closely linked to the structure function of the 3D velocity ﬁeld. Yet another easily obtainable proxy of the velocity ﬁeld length scales is the ratio of the amplitude of the projected velocity ﬁeld (line energy) variations to the dispersion of the velocity along the line of sight (line width). Finally the projected velocity ﬁeld can be easily converted into 3D velocity ﬁeld, especially for clusters like Coma with an extended ﬂat core in the surface brightness. Under assumption of a homogeneous isotropic Gaussian 3D velocity ﬁeld we derived simple expressions relating the power spectrum of the 3D velocity ﬁeld (or structure function) and the observables. We illustrate the sensitivity of these proxies to changes in the characteristics of the power spectrum for a simple isothermal β-model of a cluster. The uncertainties in the observables, caused by the stochastic nature of the velocity ﬁeld, are estimated by making multiple realizations of the random Gaussian velocity ﬁeld and evaluating the scatter in observables. If large-scale motions are present in the ICM these uncertainties may dominate the statistical errors of line width and shift measurements.},

The resulting 2D spectra are converted to 3D power spectra of gas density ﬂuctuations. Our independent analyses of the XMM–Newton and Chandra observations are in excellent agreement and provide the most sensitive measurements of surface brightness and density ﬂuctuations for a hot cluster. We ﬁnd that the characteristic amplitude of the volume ﬁlling density ﬂuctuations relative to the smooth underlying density distribution varies from 7–10 per cent on scales of ∼500 kpc down to ∼5 per cent on scales of ∼30 kpc. On smaller spatial scales, projection effects smear the density ﬂuctuations by a large factor, precluding strong limits on the ﬂuctuations in 3D. On the largest scales probed (hundreds of kpc), the dominant contributions to the observed ﬂuctuations most likely arise from perturbations of the gravitational potential by the two most massive galaxies in Coma, NGC4874 and NGC4889, and the low-entropy gas brought to the cluster by an infalling group. Other plausible sources of X-ray surface brightness ﬂuctuations are discussed, including turbulence, metal abundance variations and unresolved sources. Despite a variety of possible origins for density ﬂuctuations, the gas in the Coma cluster core is remarkably homogeneous on scales from ∼500 to ∼30 kpc.},

In this paper we study these fluctuations in M87/Virgo to establish whether sound waves/shocks, bubbles, or uplifted cold gas dominate the structure. We exploit the strong dependence of the emissivity on density and temperature in different energy bands to distinguish between these processes. Using simulations we demonstrate that our analysis recovers the leading type of fluctuation even in the presence of projection effects and temperature gradients. We confirm the isobaric nature of cool filaments of gas entrained by buoyantly rising bubbles, extending to 7′ to the east and southwest, and the adiabatic nature of the weak shocks at 40″ and 3′ from the center. For features of ∼5–10 kpc, we show that the central 4′ × 4′ region is dominated by cool structures in pressure equilibrium with the ambient hotter gas while up to 30\% of the variance in this region can be ascribed to adiabatic fluctuations. The remaining part of the central 14′ × 14′ region, excluding the arms and shocks described above, is dominated by apparently isothermal fluctuations (bubbles) with a possible admixture (at the level of ∼30\%) of adiabatic (sound waves) and by isobaric structures. Larger features, of about 30 kpc, show a stronger contribution from isobaric fluctuations. The results broadly agree with a model based on feedback from an active galactic nucleus mediated by bubbles of relativistic plasma.},

In this review we focus on observations in the X-ray band. X-ray surveys with the ROSAT satellite, supplemented by follow-up studies with ASCA and Beppo-SAX, have allowed an assessment of the evolution of the space density of clusters out to z{\textasciitilde}1, and the evolution of the physical properties of the intra-cluster medium out to z{\textasciitilde}0.5. With the advent of Chandra and Newton-XMM, and their unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution, these studies have been extended beyond redshift unity and have revealed the complexity of the thermodynamical structure of clusters. The properties of the intra-cluster gas are significantly affected by non-gravitational processes including star formation and Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. Convincing evidence has emerged for modest evolution of both the bulk of the X-ray cluster population and their thermodynamical properties since redshift unity. Such an observational scenario is consistent with hierarchical models of structure formation in a flat low density universe with Omega\_m=0.3 and sigma\_8=0.7-0.8 for the normalization of the power spectrum. Basic methodologies for construction of X-ray-selected cluster samples are reviewed and implications of cluster evolution for cosmological models are discussed.},

	abstract = {The most successful cosmological models to date envision structure formation as a hierarchical process in which gravity is constantly drawing lumps of matter together to form increasingly larger structures. Clusters of galaxies currently sit atop this hierarchy as the largest objects that have had time to collapse under the influence of their own gravity. Thus, their appearance on the cosmic scene is also relatively recent. Two features of clusters make them uniquely useful tracers of cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest things whose masses we can reliably measure because they are the largest objects to have undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial equilibrium. Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to determine the amount of structure in the universe on scales of 10{\textasciicircum}14 to 10{\textasciicircum}15 solar masses, and comparisons of the present-day cluster mass distribution with the mass distribution at earlier times can be used to measure the rate of structure formation, placing important constraints on cosmological models. Second, clusters are essentially ``closed boxes'' that retain all their gaseous matter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active galactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are so deep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore contains a wealth of information about the processes associated with galaxy formation, including the efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars and the effects of the resulting feedback processes on galaxy formation. This article reviews our theoretical understanding of both the dark-matter component and the baryonic component of clusters. (Abridged)},

	abstract = {Galaxy clusters, the largest clearly defined objects in our Universe, are ideal laboratories to study in detail the cosmic evolution of the intergalactic intracluster medium (ICM) and the cluster galaxy population. For the ICM, which is heated to X-ray radiating temperatures, X-ray spectroscopy is the most important tool to obtain insight into the structure and astrophysics of galaxy clusters. The ICM is also the hottest plasma that can be well studied under thermal equilibrium conditions. In this review we recall the basic principles of the interpretation of X-ray spectra from a hot, tenuous plasma and we illustrate the wide range of scientific applications of X-ray spectroscopy. The determination of galaxy cluster masses, the most important prerequisite for using clusters in cosmological studies, rest crucially on a precise spectroscopic determination of the ICM temperature distribution. The study of the thermal structure of the ICM provides a very interesting fossil record of the energy release during galaxy formation and evolution, giving important constraints on galaxy formation models. The temperature and pressure distribution of the ICM gives us important insight into the process of galaxy cluster merging and the dissipation of the merger energy in form of turbulent motion. Cooling cores in the centers of about half of the cluster population are interesting laboratories to investigate the interplay between gas cooling, star- and black hole formation and energy feedback, which is diagnosed by means of X-ray spectroscopy. The element abundances deduced from X-ray spectra of the ICM provide a cosmic history record of the contribution of different supernovae to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements and their spatial distribution partly reflects important transport processes in the ICM. Some discussion of plasma diagnostics for conditions out of thermal equilibrium and an outlook on the future prospects of X-ray spectroscopic cluster studies complete our review.},

We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting cluster, their mass function and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions, the thermodynamical and non-thermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intra-cluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and thus can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. We put particular emphasis on examining assumptions and limitations of the widely used self-similar model of clusters. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in non-standard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.},

	abstract = {Des découvertes inédites dans le domaine de l'astronomie en rayons X nécessitent une nouvelle génération d'instruments, pouvant observer le ciel en combinant des hautes résolutions spatiales et spectrales. Ce besoin constitue le fondement du X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) de la mission Athena de l'ESA, dont le lancement est prévu en 2031. La complexité de la chaîne de détection du X-IFU nécessite un suivi de ses perturbations instrumentales. Des simulations bout-à-bout, reproduisant les observations en rayons X de l'émission des photons d'une source représentative à leur détection, sont un outil de choix pour ces études. Dans la première partie de cette thèse, j'utilise ces simulateurs pour quantifier l'effet de la diaphonie entre les pixels, pour dériver une spécification sur la connaissance du bruit de fond instrumental, ou encore pour estimer la sensibilité spectrale de l'instrument. Mes résultats confirment que le X-IFU atteindra ses exigences en taux de comptage pour des sources étendues brillantes. Ils démontrent aussi qu'une bonne connaissance des raies spectrales, ainsi que du niveau bruit de fond instrumental (à mieux que 2\%) est indispensable pour éviter des erreurs systématiques dans le traitement des données. L'analyse des performances doit cependant être couplée à des études de faisabilité des objectifs scientifiques du X-IFU. Cela concerne particulièrement les observations de sources étendues, qui feront appel à tout le potentiel de l'instrument. La deuxième partie de ce travail analyse les capacités du X-IFU à caractériser les propriétés physiques et chimiques du milieu intra-amas, ainsi que sa turbulence. Pour obtenir des simulations représentatives, des modèles ou d'autres simulations numériques sont utilisés comme point de départ de ces études. Mes résultats montrent la puissance du X-IFU à mesurer les propriétés des amas de galaxies, même à haut redshift (z {\textasciitilde} 2) et sur des temps d'exposition de 100ks. Je présente également une nouvelle façon d'aborder les biais sur les diagnostics spectraux. Elle permettra d'optimiser les observations de la turbulence dans les amas. Enfin, pour remplir ses objectifs scientifiques, le X-IFU nécessitera une calibration très précise. La troisième partie de cette thèse aborde différents points de la calibration du X-IFU, notamment la connaissance de son échelle de gain, de son efficacité quantique et de son bruit de fond instrumental. Je démontre que de nouvelles méthodes de correction de gain et de surveillance du niveau de bruit de fond instrumental sont nécessaires pour vérifier les spécifications attendues. Ces résultats permettent d'optimiser l'architecture de l'instrument (par ex., sources modulées de rayons X, stratégies de corrections) et de mieux préparer ses phases de calibration au sol et en vol. Les études de calibration se feront aussi et surtout par des essais en conditions représentatives, comme dans le banc cryogénique développé et caractérisé à l'IRAP au cours de ma thèse.},

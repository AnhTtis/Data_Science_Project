\section{Introduction}

We provide some additional material in support of the main paper. 
The content is organised as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sec.~\ref{sec:dataset_splits} provides a description of the proposed datasets for the evaluation of NCD methods for point cloud semantic segmentation;
    \item Sec.~\ref{sec:eums_3D} reports the implementation details of EUMS$^\dag$, our adaptation for 3D point cloud data of the method proposed by Zhao et al.~\cite{zhao2022novel} (originally designed for NCD in 2D image semantic segmentation);
    \item Sec.~\ref{sec:supplementary_qualitative} shows a collection of additional qualitative results produced with \ourmethod on all the different splits of  SemanticPOSS-$n^i$ and SemanticKITTI-$n^i$.
\end{itemize}

abstract = {We have investigated the stability properties of a linear radio frequency ion trap with cylindrical electrodes. Inside the region of stability for an ideal trap we found a number of instabilities similar to those experimentally observed in three-dimensional traps. They arise from higher order contributions to the ideal quadrupole trapping potential. The static potential for axial confinement shifts the radial ion oscillation frequencies and leads to additional instabilities.}

For each cluster size, the experimental values of the charge transfer cross-section σ(v) are ﬁtted with an universal parametric curve with two independent parameters σm and vm, the maximum cross-section and the corresponding velocity. For small size clusters (n ≤ 15), the σ(v) characteristic parameters show strong variations with the number of atoms in the cluster. Abrupt dips observed for n = 10 and n = 22 are attributed to electronic properties. Charge transfer patterns observed for various collisional systems present similarities, which appear more sensitive to cluster quantum size eﬀects than to collision energy defects. In their whole, the σm and vm parameters show diﬀerences in both their size evolution and their absolute values discussed in term of projectile and target electronic structures.},

Radiative lifetimes and the principal rotational constants are included. Observations in the gas phase, in molecular beams, and in rare-gas and diatomic molecule matrices are evaluated, and several thousand references are cited. The types of measurement surveyed include conventional and laser-based absorption and emission techniques, laser absorption with mass analysis, and photoelectron spectroscopy.}",

	abstract = {A cloud of ultracold atoms confined in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) has a temperature greater than that of a low-density vapour in the same light field. It has been observed (Drewsen M. et al., Appl. Phys. B, 59 (1994) 283) that this temperature excess is proportional to the cube root of the total number of trapped atoms (N1/3). We present an explanation for this effect in terms of the scattering which arises when photons spontaneously emitted by atoms have an appreciable probability of being reabsorbed within the cloud. This hypothesis has been tested by time-of-flight measurements of the temperature of clouds of atoms released from a MOT into 1-dimensional and 3-dimensional optical molasses in the σ+-σ- and lin ⊥ lin configuration.}

abstract = {A classical collective behavior is observed in the spatial distributions of a cloud of optically trapped neutral atoms. They include extended uniform-density ellipsoids, rings of atoms around a small central ball, and clumps of atoms orbiting a central core. The distributions depend sensitively on the number of atoms and the alignment of the laser beams. Abrupt bistable transitions between different distributions are seen. This system is studied in detail, and much of this behavior can be explained by the incorporation of long-range interactions between the atoms in the equation of equilibrium. It is shown how attenuation and multiple scattering of the incident photons lead to these interactions.},

	abstract = {The prospect of cooling matter down to temperatures that are close to absolute zero raises intriguing questions about how chemical reactivity changes under these extreme conditions. Although some types of chemical reaction still occur at 1 μK, they can no longer adhere to the conventional picture of reactants passing over an activation energy barrier to become products. Indeed, at ultracold temperatures, the system enters a fully quantum regime, and quantum mechanics replaces the classical picture of colliding particles. In this Review, we discuss recent experimental and theoretical developments that allow us to explore chemical reactions at temperatures that range from 100 K to 500 nK. Although the field is still in its infancy, exceptional control has already been demonstrated over reactivity at low temperatures.},

We calculate the integral elastic cross-section and the resonant charge-transfer cross-section by the quantum mechanical molecular orbital close-coupling method, and then obtain kia for temperatures by averaging the cross-sections over a Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution. The experiments are conducted in an ion–neutral hybrid trap, where the Rb+ ions are created by photo-ionization of the cold atoms in a magneto-optic trap (MOT) and accumulated in the linear Paul ion trap. The total ion–atom collision rate kia is measured by monitoring the uorescence reduction of the steady-state MOT atoms by sequentially introducing photo-ionization and ion–atom collisions. The ion–atom collision energy Ecol ≈ Ti is modi ed by changing Ti due to Ti being more than six orders of magnitude larger than the Ta of cold atoms. The temperature of ions Ti is obtained by comparing the time-of- ight mass spectrometry of Rb+ from experimental results to that obtained by SIMION simulation. The equilibrium steady Ti is modi ed by changing the initial root-mean-squared position of the ion cloud, and the kia are measured with Ecol from 8000 to 16 000 K. Both the theoretical and experimental results show that kia increases with Ecol. More speci cally, the measured kia increases rapidly with the enlargement of Ecol near 10 000 K. The theoretical calculation results show that kia increases slowly with Ecol. The speci c difference may be due to the in uence of the ratio of excited states fe on the trend of kia at different Ecol.},

	abstract = {Cold chemical reactions between laser-cooled Ca{\textasciicircum}+ ions and Rb atoms were studied in an ion-atom hybrid trap. Reaction rate constants were determined in the range of collision energies {\textless}E\_\{coll\}{\textgreater}/k\_B = 20 mK-20 K. The lowest energies were achieved in experiments using single localized Ca{\textasciicircum}+ ions. Product branching ratios were studied using resonant-excitation mass spectrometry. The dynamics of the reactive processes in this system (non-radiative and radiative charge transfer as well as radiative association leading to the formation of CaRb{\textasciicircum}+ molecular ions) have been analyzed using high-level quantum-chemical calculations of the potential energy curves of CaRb{\textasciicircum}+ and quantum-scattering calculations for the radiative channels. For the present low-energy scattering experiments, it is shown that the energy dependence of the reaction rate constants is governed by long-range interactions in line with the classical Langevin model, but their magnitude is determined by short-range non-adiabatic and radiative couplings which only weakly depend on the asymptotic energy. The quantum character of the collisions is predicted to manifest itself in the occurrence of narrow shape resonances at well-defined collision energies. The present results highlight both universal and system-specific phenomena in cold ion-neutral reactive collisions.},

The product distribution after the collision can be estimated by making use of the distorted wave Born approximation. We ﬁnd that the inelastic collisions lead predominantly to small changes in the binding energy of the molecular ion.},

              F
              ), cannot be applied to clusters because energy levels are always discrete in a system of finite size. We propose an alternative definition whereby clusters can be considered metallic when the gap between occupied and unoccupied states at E
              F
              is consistently smaller than or equal to the Kubo band gap δ. We use the experimental findings of photoelectron spectroscopy of anionic clusters to analyze band gaps of various cluster families. Monovalent clusters (alkali and noble metals) grossly follow the shell structure pattern, producing band gaps smaller than δ for most cluster sizes, with some exceptional sizes exhibiting electronic shell closure or symmetry-induced band gaps. Among the bivalent metals, only mercury shows consistent band gap closure with increasing cluster size, that is a simple insulator-metal transition. Other bivalent elements such as Zn and Mg exhibit a much more complicated behavior. We also briefly discuss complex cluster families such as aluminum and transition metals.},

The dependence of the photoionization cross-section from different intermediate states populated in the ﬁrst step and ionized in the second step are discussed, including results on the photoionization cross-sections measured above the ﬁrst ionization threshold. Results based on different polarizations of the exciting and the ionizing dye lasers are also discussed. Examples are provided, illustrating the photoionization cross-sections measured using thermionic diode ion detector, atomic beam apparatus in conjunction with a time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer and DC/RF glow discharge cell as an optogalvanic detection.},

	abstract = {By photoionizing samples of laser-cooled atoms with laser light tuned just above the ionization limit, plasmas can be created with electron and ion temperatures below 10 K. These ultracold neutral plasmas have extended the temperature bounds of plasma physics by two orders of magnitude. Table-top experiments, using many of the tools from atomic physics, allow for the study of plasma phenomena in this new regime with independent control over the density and temperature of the plasma through the excitation process. Characteristic of these systems is an inhomogeneous density profile, inherited from the density distribution of the laser-cooled neutral atom sample. Most work has dealt with unconfined plasmas in vacuum, which expand outward at velocities of order 100 m/s, governed by electron pressure, and with lifetimes of order 100 μs, limited by stray electric fields. Using detection of charged particles and optical detection techniques, a wide variety of properties and phenomena have been observed, including expansion dynamics, collective excitations in both the electrons and ions, and collisional properties. Through three-body recombination collisions, the plasmas rapidly form Rydberg atoms, and clouds of cold Rydberg atoms have been observed to spontaneously avalanche ionize to form plasmas. Of particular interest is the possibility of the formation of strongly coupled plasmas, where Coulomb forces dominate thermal motion and correlations become important. The strongest impediment to strong coupling is disorder-induced heating, a process in which Coulomb energy from an initially disordered sample is converted into thermal energy. This restricts electrons to a weakly coupled regime and leaves the ions barely within the strongly coupled regime. This review will give an overview of the field of ultracold neutral plasmas, from its inception in 1999 to current work, including efforts to increase strong coupling and effects on plasma properties due to strong coupling.},

They represent a new frontier in the study of neutral plasmas, which traditionally deals with much hotter systems, but they also blur the boundaries of plasma, atomic, condensed matter, and low temperature physics. Modeling these plasmas challenges computational techniques and theories of non-equilibrium systems, so the ﬁeld has attracted great interest from the theoretical and computational physics communities. By varying laser intensities and wavelengths it is possible to accurately set the initial plasma density and energy, and charged-particle-detection and optical diagnostics allow precise measurements for comparison with theoretical predictions.},

	abstract = {Three-body electron-ion recombination in a molecular ambient gas is investigated theoretically. The limited success attained by a classical treatment is lost when necessary account is taken of the discreteness of the negative energy levels of the recombining electron. Thus the three-body recombination coefficientscalculated in carbon dioxide and in water vapour differ from those measured by Warman et a1 and Sennhauser er al, being much lower and falling off far more steeply with increase in temperature. It is noted that the ions involved in the laboratory study, (CO:), and H30+(H20),,are open to dissociative recombination and it is pointed out that this process and three-body recombination supplement one another with striking consequences. The mechanism is in two stages: firstly, collisions between the electrons and the ambient gas molecules populate the Rydberg levels; secondly, the electrons in the Rydberg levels participate in radiationless transitions leading to dissociation in the same way as free electrons. A suitably descriptive name for the mechanism is collisional dissociatiue recombination. Detailed calculations give gas-density-dependent recombination coefficients in quite good agreement with those measured.},

The calculations use electronic energies and autoionization widths of valence states obtained from ab initio R-matrix calculations with the corresponding potential curves calibrated using available spectroscopic data. Six valence states open to dissociation are included in the ﬁnal calculations. Excellent agreement with the measured cross sections is obtained for the low-energy DR, up to 3 eV and, for the ﬁrst time, the peak observed in the cross section at high energy is accounted for. The importance of the various dissociative states at different electron energies, as well as the direct and indirect processes, is discussed. Compared to previous theoretical studies, the inclusion of a third dissociative state of 2 symmetry and the larger autoionization width of the B 2 state are found to be particularly important for the agreement with experiment.},

In contrast to our previous study for NO, but similar to the case of O2, the forward-scattered CO+ yields show a broader angular distribution at the higher collision energy. Typically, the Franck−Condon-region charge transfer, energy resonant charge transfer, and intimate collision are three diﬀerent mechanisms in which the intimate collision experiences an intermediate complex, and this mechanism usually plays an essential role in the thermal-energy reactions. However, the present observations indicate that this mechanism, concerning the intermediate (Ar−CO)+, is still of utmost importance in a relatively high collision-energy range.},

            New facilities such as the National Ignition Facility and the Linac Coherent Light Source have pushed the frontiers of high energy-density matter. These facilities offer unprecedented opportunities for exploring extreme states of matter, ranging from cryogenic solid-state systems to hot, dense plasmas, with applications to inertial-confinement fusion and astrophysics. However, significant gaps in our understanding of material properties in these rapidly evolving systems still persist. In particular, non-equilibrium transport properties of strongly-coupled Coulomb systems remain an open question. Here, we study ion-ion temperature relaxation in a binary mixture, exploiting a recently-developed dual-species ultracold neutral plasma. We compare measured relaxation rates with atomistic simulations and a range of popular theories. Our work validates the assumptions and capabilities of the simulations and invalidates theoretical models in this regime. This work illustrates an approach for precision determinations of detailed material properties in Coulomb mixtures across a wide range of conditions.},

As this surface includes diagonal adiabatic and relativistic corrections to the fixed nuclei electronic energies, the remaining discrepancies between our calculated and experimental data should be due to the neglect of non-adiabatic coupling to excited electronic states in the calculations. To account for this, our calculated energy values were adjusted empirically by a simple correction formula. Based on our understanding of the adiabatic approximation, we suggest two new approaches to account for the off-diagonal adiabatic correction, which should work; however, they have not been tested yet for

The BO-PES is improved by the inclusion of relativistic effects and adiabatic corrections. It is discussed how non-adiabatic effects on rotation and vibration can be simulated by corrections to the moving nuclear masses. The importance of the appropriate analytic fit to the computed points of the PES for the subsequent computation of the rovibronic spectrum is addressed. Some recent extensions of the computed PES in the energy region above the barrier to linearity are reviewed. This involves a large set of input geometries and the correct treatment of the dissociation asymptotics, including the coupling with the first excited singlet state.

Prior to this study, spectroscopic information necessary for state preparation, readout, and analysis of systematic errors was not available. We have developed a powerful technique for broadband, high-resolution survey spectroscopy of molecular ions that combines cavity-enhanced direct frequency-comb spectroscopy with velocity-modulation spectroscopy (vms) and used this to measure four bands in HfF+ over a 1000 cmÀ1 bandwidth near 800 nm. Additionally, we performed targeted scans with cw-laser vms to ﬁnd 15 additional bands from 9950 to 14600 cmÀ1. We present a detailed analysis of these bands to obtain high-precision rovibrational constants, K-doublings, and isotope splittings for eight electronic states. We also use our results to improve theoretical predictions and discuss implications of our measurements to the eEDM experiments. These results demonstrate the application of frequency-comb and cw-vms for broadband, high-resolution spectroscopy of molecular ions.},

In a demonstration experiment, we have examined an Fe II transition near 260 nm, attaining a linewidth of about 250 MHz. The method is well suited to measure transition frequencies and hyperﬁne structure. It could also be used to measure small isotope shifts in isotope-enriched samples.},

	abstract = {On the basis of both experiment and theory, accurate rotational− vibrational line positions and energy levels, with associated critically reviewed labels and uncertainties, are reported for the ground electronic state of the H3+ molecular ion. An improved MARVEL algorithm is used to determine the validated experimental levels and their self-consistent uncertainties from a set of 1610 measured transitions and associated uncertainties, coming from 26 sources. 1410 transitions have been validated for ortho-H3+ and para-H3+, 78 belong to ﬂoating components of the spectroscopic network (SN) investigated and thus left unvalidated, while 122 measured transitions had to be excluded from the MARVEL analysis for one reason or another. The spectral range covered by the experiments is 7−16 506 cm−1 . Altogether 13 vibrational band origins are reported, the highest J value, where J stands for the rotational quantum number, for which energy levels are validated is 12. The MARVEL energy levels are checked against ones determined from accurate variational nuclear motion computations employing the best available adiabatic ab initio potential energy surface and exact kinetic energy operators. The number of validated and thus recommended experimental-quality rovibrational energy levels is 652, of which 259 belong to ortho-H3+ and 393 to para-H3+. There are 105 further energy levels within ﬂoating components of the SN. The variational computations have been performed both without and with a simple nonadiabatic correction, whereby nonadiabaticity is modeled by the use of a non-nuclear vibrational mass. The lists of validated lines and levels for H3+ are deposited in the Supporting Information to this paper.},

Consisting of three identical fermions, its properties are profoundly inﬂuenced by the requirements of exchange symmetry, most notably the nonexistence of its ground rotational state. Spectroscopy of H3+ is often used to infer the relative abundances of its two nuclear spin modiﬁcations, ortho- and para-H3+, which are important in areas as diverse as electron dissociative recombination and deuterium fractionation in cold interstellar clouds. In this paper, we explore in detail the impact of exchange symmetry on the states of H3+, with a particular focus on the state degeneracies necessary for converting spectral transition intensities to relative abundances. We address points of confusion in the literature surrounding these issues and discuss the implications for proton-transfer reactions of H3+ at low temperatures.},

Several Nþ2 transitions have been observed with much higher precision than previously possible, and transitions that were blended in earlier Doppler-limited experiments are now resolved. The full-width at half-maximum of the observed Lamb dips is \$ 40 MHz, and appears to be dominated by a broadening due to the velocity modulation. Future extension of this technique into the mid-infrared should enable significant improvements in the sensitivity and resolution of vibrational spectroscopy of molecular ions.},

The ground state equilibrium structure of Hþ3 is an equilateral triangle, but near the energies of \$ 9913 cmÀ1, the so called barrier to linearity, it begins to sample linear conﬁgurations for which theoretical calculations are challenging because of the singularity of the Hamiltonian. We present here a continuation of the spectroscopy of Hþ3 above the barrier to linearity using a Ti:sapphire laser based high sensitivity spectrometer which allowed us to observe the spectrum with near shot-noise limited sensitivity. 121 new lines have been recorded from the near infrared 10 300 cmÀ1–13 700 cmÀ1 entering the visible region bringing the total number of transitions above 10 000 cmÀ1 to 143. The observed spectrum is compared with theoretical predictions. The remaining discrepancies mostly due to vibrational and rotational non-adiabatic effects are discussed.},

              Femtochemistry techniques have been instrumental in accessing the short time scales necessary to probe transient intermediates in chemical reactions. In this study, we took the contrasting approach of prolonging the lifetime of an intermediate by preparing reactant molecules in their lowest rovibronic quantum state at ultralow temperatures, thereby markedly reducing the number of exit channels accessible upon their mutual collision. Using ionization spectroscopy and velocity-map imaging of a trapped gas of potassium-rubidium (KRb) molecules at a temperature of 500 nanokelvin, we directly observed reactants, intermediates, and products of the reaction

At the same time, theoretical work has made progress in tackling these problems and accurately describing quantum effects in complex systems, and in proposing viable options to control chemical reactions at ultralow energies. Through tutorials on both the theoretical and experimental aspects of research in cold and ultracold molecular collisions, this book provides advanced undergraduate students, graduate students and researchers with the foundations needed to understand this exciting field.}",

              Quantum control of chemical reactions is an important goal in chemistry and physics. Ultracold chemical reactions are often controlled by preparing the reactants in specific quantum states. Here we demonstrate spin-controlled atom–ion inelastic (spin-exchange) processes and chemical (charge-exchange) reactions in an ultracold Rb-Sr
              +
              mixture. The ion’s spin state is controlled by the atomic hyperfine spin state via spin-exchange collisions, which polarize the ion’s spin parallel to the atomic spin. We achieve {\textasciitilde} 90\% spin polarization due to the absence of strong spin-relaxation channel. Charge-exchange collisions involving electron transfer are only allowed for (RbSr)
              +
              colliding in the singlet manifold. Initializing the atoms in various spin states affects the overlap of the collision wave function with the singlet molecular manifold and therefore also the reaction rate. Our observations agree with theoretical predictions.},

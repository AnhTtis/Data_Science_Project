    "abstract": "We have produced cold ($\\leq$ mK) polyatomic cations $^{87}$Rb$_N^+$ ($N$ = 2, 3,$\\ldots$,18 ) in the two-step CW-laser photoionization of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms in the ion-atom hybrid trap. The resulting reaction products were directly observed using a combination of time-of-flight mass spectrometry and resonant-excitation mass spectrometry. Furthermore, we experimentally verified the cascade generation and cascade dissociation of this series of polyatomic cations by controlling the duration of ion-atom interaction and the storage times of ions in the ion trap. The methods we developed for assembling and detecting homonuclear polyatomic cations can be applied to any experiment in an ion-atom hybrid trap. This research lays the foundation for studying cold-controlled ion-atom chemistry and the evolution of the interstellar medium, as well as exploring atomically precise metal clusters and physics from a few-body to many-body perspective.",

The source code of all machine learning models, of the generation of synthetic
crystals, of the optimized simulation of diffractograms, and of the distributed
computing architecture can be found on
\url{https://github.com/aimat-lab/ML4pXRDs} (v1.0). The used machine learning models are further
discussed in detail in the Supplementary Information.

The ICSD data used to evaluate the models \added{(database version 2021, June 15)} belongs to FIZ Karlsruhe, from which academic and non-academic licenses are available. \added{The RRUFF mineral database (access date: 2022, Jan 12) for the evaluation on experimental data can be obtained from \url{https://rruff.info/}.}

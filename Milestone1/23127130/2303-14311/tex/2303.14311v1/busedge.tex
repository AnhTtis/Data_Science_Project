\redX{-- Drive-by sensing, transit systems can act as sustainable sensors for the city for monitoring road conditions~\cite{mohannericell}, public service infrastructure~\cite{Ye-2021-128891}, HD map updates~\cite{Bu-2022-133236} etc. -- Edge execution necessary because single bus with 7 cameras at 5 fps captures a million frames everyday.  -- US has half a million school buses alone~\cite{schoolbuses}. Too much data for cloud.  -- Edge devices are resource constrained, along with latency, memory also becomes important. -- Jetson devices have 8 to 16 GB RAM shared between GPU and CPU cores, and for ML on multiple streams, spatial downsampling is necessary. --- In the considered scenario, VP is fixed, so we can cache saliency S. -- Our results on Busedge Accessibility shows we consume xx memory which yy times less than baseline, while real-time performance improvement of \green{aa} sAP.}

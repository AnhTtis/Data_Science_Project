    \textbf{User study interface.} (Top) We present users with multiple images from each scene, that show it from multiple angles. (Bottom) We ask users to rate the scene on a scale from $1{-}5$ by asking them about the 3D structure completeness (question 1) and the overall perceptual quality (question 2).}

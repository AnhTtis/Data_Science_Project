% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

%Heart murmurs provide valuable information about mechanical activity of the heart, and thus, are clinically significant measure which aid in diagnosis of various heart valve diseases. 
This work leverages deep learning (DL) techniques in order to do automatic and accurate heart murmur detection from phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings.  Two public PCG datasets (CirCor Digiscope 2022 dataset and PCG 2016 dataset) from Physionet online database are utilized to train and test three custom neural networks (NN): a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), and a convolutional RNN (C-RNN). Under our proposed method, we first do pre-processing on both datasets in order to prepare the data for the NNs. Key pre-processing steps include the following: denoising, segmentation, re-labeling of noise-only segments, data normalization, and time-frequency analysis of the PCG segments using wavelet scattering transform. We note that the segmentation step results in a number of noise-only segments; thus, we re-label the noise-only segments. Further, we do exhaustive search to find optimal segment length (which turns out to be 4 sec). 

To evaluate the performance of the three NNs we have implemented, we conduct four experiments, first three using PCG 2022 dataset, and fourth using PCG 2016 dataset. It turns out that our custom 1D-CNN outperforms other two NNs (LSTM-RNN and C-RNN) as well as the state-of-the-art. 
%in terms of accuracy, weighted accuracy, F1-score, and area under receive operating charactertic (AUROC) curve. 
Specifically, for experiment E1 (murmur detection using original PCG 2022 dataset), our 1D-CNN model achieves an accuracy of 82.28\%, weighted accuracy of 83.81\%, F1-score of 65.79\%, and and area under receive operating charactertic (AUROC) curve of 90.79\%. 
For experiment E2 (mumur detection using PCG 2022 dataset with unknown class removed), our 1D-CNN model achieves an accuracy of 87.05\%, F1-score of 87.72\%, and AUROC of 94.4\%. 
For experiment E3 (murmur detection using PCG 2022 dataset with re-labeling of segments), our 1D-CNN model achieves an accuracy of 82.86\%, weighted accuracy of 86.30\%, F1-score of 81.87\%, and AUROC of 93.45\%. 
For experiment E4 (abnormal PCG detection using PCG 2016 dataset), our 1D-CNN model achieves an accuracy of 96.30\%, F1-score of 96.29\% and AUROC of 98.17\%.

%we also abnormal PCG detection. relatively shallow 1D-CNN that consists of 4 convolutional layers and 4 fully connected layers. Specifically, our 1D-CNN does murmur detection with an accuracy of 79\%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.84. Furthermore, the experiments were repeated excluding the low-quality recordings (annotated in CirCor dataset as "Unknown"), resulting in an even higher performance, with a classification accuracy of 86\% and an AUROC that is 0.93. Last but not the least, the proposed DL model was also used to make a distinction between the normal and abnormal PCG signals from CinC-Physionet-2016 dataset. The results obtained were really good, with a classification accuracy of 96\% and an AUROC that is 0.99.

Cardiac auscultation provides valuable insights into the mechanical activity of heart, and remains the gold standard for diagnosis of a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. Phonocardiogram (PCG)---the systematic recording of heart sounds by means of a digital stethoscope, is a clinically significant method to study the pathology of the four heart valves (i.e., the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, aortic valve, and pulmonary valve). This is because the PCG could record abnormal sounds, known as heart murmurs, made by heart valves as they open and close during cardiac cycle. Heart murmurs, when present, often indicate the presence of a heart valve disease, e.g., mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, congenital heart disease, septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus in newborns, defective cardiac valves, rheumatic heart disease, etc \cite{review1}. Thus, early murmur detection, classification, and grading analysis in an automated fashion to help diagnose a valvular heart disease at an early stage is the need of the hour \cite{review2}. 

PCG signal acquisition is done from following four chest locations where the valves can be best heard: Aortic area, Pulmonic area, Tricuspid area, and Mitral area \cite{2022challengepaper}. For a normal sinus cardiac cycle, the PCG signal captures two fundamental heart sounds, first is called S1 sound while second is called S2 sounds. S1 signifies the start of isovolumetric ventricular contraction with the closing of the mitral and tricuspid valves amid rapid increase in pressure within the ventricles. S2, on the other hand, implies the start of diastole with the closing of the aortic and pulmonic valves. In addition to S1 and S2 sounds, the mechanical activity of the heart may occasionally give rise other sounds which include: third heart sound (S3), the fourth heart sound (S4), systolic ejection click (EC), mid-systolic click (MC), diastolic sound or opening snap (OS), and heart murmurs (due to turbulent flow of blood due to malfunctioning of heart valves) \cite{2016DS}.   

PCG signal analysis for abnormal heart beat detection and for murmur detection has traditionally been done using classical signal processing techniques \cite{classicaldsp}. More recently, there has been enormous interest in utilizing tools from machine learning \cite{mlpcg}, deep learning \cite{dlpcg}, and transfer learning \cite{tlpcg} in order to do heart sounds classification (see the review articles \cite{review1},\cite{review2}, and references therein for more in-depth discussion of the related work). 

{\bf Contributions.}
Inline with the recent surge of interest in utilizing deep learning methods for PCG signal analysis, this work utilizes two public PCG datasets (PCG 2022 dataset and PCG 2016 dataset) from Physionet database \cite{physionetwebsite} to train and test three custom neural networks (NN), i.e., 1D-CNN, LSTM-RNN, C-RNN for heart murmur and abnormal PCG detection. We first pre-process the data in order to split each PCG signal into smaller segments using a custom-designed GUI framework. We systematically identify the noise-only segments and re-label them, and do exhaustive search to determine optimal segment size. We conduct four experiments to evaluate the performance of our NN models on following four datasets: 1) PCG 2022 dataset as is, 2) PCG 2022 dataset with unknown class removed, 3) PCG 2022 dataset with re-labeled segments, and 4) PCG 2016 dataset. We note that our 1D-CNN model outperforms the other two NN models (i.e., LSTM-RNN and C-RNN), as well as the state-of-the-art methods for murmur detection.

{\bf Outline.}
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes selected related work on murmur detection and heart valve disease classification. Section III outlines essential details of the two public datasets used, pre-processing done, and time-frequency domain methods for feature extraction. Section IV presents three deep learning classifiers for murmur detection and abnormal PCG detection. Section V discusses performance results for all three classifiers for both datasets. Section VI concludes the paper.

\section{Related Work}

Broadly speaking, the relevant literature on PCG signal analysis has attempted to solve following major problems, to date: i) identification of fundamental heart sounds (S1 and S2) \cite{s1s2}, ii) abnormal PCG detection (by identifying sounds other than the normal lub-dub sound) \cite{abnormalheartsound}, iii) heart sound classification (normal sounds, murmurs, extra clicks, artifacts) \cite{heartsoundclassification}, iv) heart murmur detection \cite{murmurdetect2022dataset}, v) heart valve disease classification (by means of heart murmur classification) \cite{heartvalvedisease}, and vi) PCG signal denoising methods \cite{denoisingpcg}. Lately, there is a work which attempts to do automatic murmur grading analysis \cite{2022-grading} at the patient-level, and has the potential to do disease staging and progression analysis. 

In terms of public datasets, apart from PCG 2022 dataset \cite{2022challengepaper} and PCG 2016 dataset \cite{2016DS} that are available on Physionet database, there are a few other public datasets too. These include: EPHNOGRAM \cite{ephnogram}, PASCAL, Michigan heart sound and murmur database (MHSDB) provided by the University of Michigan health system, and cardiac auscultation of heart murmurs database provided by eGeneral Medical Inc. \cite{2016DS}. On a side note, fetal PCG dataset provides 26 recordings of fetal PCG collected from expecting mothers with singleton pregnancy during their last trimester \cite{fetal-pcg}. 

Since this work focuses mainly on automatic heart murmur and abnormal PCG detection, selected work on these two problems is discussed as follows. 
\cite{sig_proccessing-2016} utilizes PCG 2016 dataset, applies multiple time-frequency analysis methods, e.g., discrete wavelet transform, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients etc., along with a feedforward neural network in order to do abnormal PCG detection, achieving 97.1\% accuracy.
\cite{unsegmented-2016Dataset} computes short time Fourier transform of the PCG signals without doing any segmentation, implements a custom CNN, and achieves an accuracy of 95.4\%, and 96.8\%, on PCG 2016 dataset and PASCAL dataset, respectively. 
\cite{Samit:IEEETIM:2022} utilizes two PCG datasets to evaluate their custom CNN model, as well as two pre-trained models (i.e., VGGNet-16, ResNet-50) in order to do heart valve disease (HVD) classification. They claim to achieve an overall accuracy of 99\% to classify the following HVD: aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and mitral valve prolapse.
\cite{cnn-classification} utilized a private dataset (with data collected at PKU Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta Hospital, Indonesia), and implemented a custom CNN model in order to HVD classification for the following diseases: angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, and hypertensive heart disease. They reported an accuracy of 85\% for their HVD classification problem. 
\cite{pediatric-heart-disease} aimed at intelligent diagnosis of murmurs in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease. They applied segmentation method to extract the first and second heart sounds from the PCG signals, and used them as input to their feedforward neural network classifier, resulting in HVD detection accuracy of 93\%. 
\cite{2015-multimodel-features} utilizes the PASCAL dataset and aims to classify PCG signals into three classes (normal, systolic murmur, diastolic murmur). To this end, they extract various time-domain features, frequency-domain features, and statistical features, and pass them to three classifiers: k-NN, fuzzy k-NN and a feedforward neural network. They report a classification accuracy of 99.6\%, that is achieved by the fuzzy k-NN. 
\cite{2016-sec-place} utilizes the PCG 2016 dataset, extracts time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency domain features from the PCG signals, and implements an ensemble of 20 feedforward neural networks in order to do abnormal PCG detection, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.5\%.
Finally, \cite{2016-third-place} utilizes the PCG 2016 dataset, extracts time-domain, frequency-domain and time-frequency domain features, does feature selection and implements a two-layer feedforward neural network for abnormal PCG detection, resulting in an accuracy of 85.2\%.

\section{Datasets, Pre-processing \& Feature Extraction }

This work utilized two PCG datasets: 1) CirCor Digiscope PCG dataset from PhysioNet 2022 challenge (called PCG 2022 dataset, in this work) \cite{2022challengedescription}, 2) PCG dataset from PhysioNet 2016 challenge (called PCG 2016 dataset, in this work). Below, we describe the key details of the two datasets, followed by the key pre-processing steps performed on each dataset, followed by feature extraction by means of various time-frequency analysis methods.


\subsection{Datasets}
{\it 1) CirCor Digiscope PCG dataset from PhysioNet 2022 challenge:}

This dataset is a collection of PCG signals collected from pediatric subjects during the two mass screening campaigns in Brazil. The dataset consists of 3,163 audio files, collected from 942 patients, sampled at 4,000 Hz. The length of these recordings vary between 5 seconds to 65 seconds. These PCG recordings have been taken from one or more of 4 possible locations on the chest, namely: AV, MV, PV, TV (see Fig. 1). Additionally, some samples have been taken at another location, labeled as Phc. Moreover, some subjects had multiple recordings for the same chest location. Murmur labels are given both patient-wise, or chest-location-wise. This implies that we could get to know whether a patient has murmur or not, as well as if the dataset annotator detected murmur in each recording separately. In this work, we go by chest-location-wise murmur detection. 
%\footnote{Only the released training data was utilized in this work. That is, all description about the CirCor Digiscope 2022 dataset in this paper is describing the training set. } 


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{fig1.png}
    \caption{Cardiac auscultation locations: AO = aortic area; LV = left ventricle; PA = pulmonary area; RV = right ventricle; 1 = right second intercostal space; 2 = left second intercostal space; 3 = midleft sternal border (tricuspid); 4 = fifth intercostal space, midclavicular line. \cite{2022challengepaper} }
    \label{fig:mesh1}
\end{figure}

%The length of each audio signal reaches more than 60 seconds in some cases. 
In addition to the audio PCG data, following meta-data is also available: age, weight, and gender of the pediatric subject. Furthermore, additional information about heart murmurs such as the location of a murmur, strength of a murmur is also given. Having said that, this work utilizes the CirCor Digiscope 2022 dataset for murmur detection, i.e., we solve a classification problem with following three classes: 1) murmur present, 2) murmur absent, and 3) unknown (noisy, unknown to the annotator).

{\it 2) PCG dataset from PhysioNet/CinC 2016 challenge:}

The PhysioNet/CinC challenge 2016 dataset consists of a total of 3,240 heart sound recordings, sampled at 2,000 Hz. The length of these recordings vary between 5 seconds to 120 seconds. All the data was recorded from a single precordial location on the chest. As for the labels, each recording has been annotated as normal (taken from a healthy subject) or abnormal (taken from subjects with confirmed cardiac diagnosis). Furthermore, each recording has been labeled as either high-quality or low quality. Moreover, some of the data belonging to abnormal class has been further annotated with the exact diagnosis that the subject suffers from. There are a total of 2,575 recordings for the normal class, while there are a total of 665 recordings for the abnormal class. Thus, the data is highly imbalanced given the number of examples for the normal and abnormal class, and this effect is more pronounced when it comes to disease labels (within the abnormal class). 

We utilize PCG 2016 dataset to solve the classification problem with two classes: 1) PCG normal, 2) PCG abnormal. One important difference between this dataset and the CirCor Digiscope dataset is that this dataset assigns normal labels even to the low-quality recordings. Thus, these recordings could still be used for the classification problem (PCG normal vs. PCG abnormal), without adding a third class for low-quality recordings.  

{Table \ref{table:key-stats} summarizes the key statistics of the two datasets.}

\subsection{Data Pre-Processing}
{\it Denoising:}
Both datasets have noise overlapping with heartbeats. Some prominent examples of noise in the two datasets include: noise due to stethoscope movement, baby crying, intense breathing, and people talking. Since the spectrums of voice and PCG overlap, complete elimination of noise is not possible. However, out-of-band (OOB) noise rejection is still possible. To this end, a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 300 Hz (chosen by experimentation) has been applied to each PCG signal to remove the OOB noise.

{\it Segmentation:}
Since recordings are not of the same length, each recording has been divided into $N$-second long segments\footnote{The optimal segment length turns out to be $N=4$, as will be discussed in Section V in more detail.}, to increase the number of training examples for the deep learning model.
Thus, for PCG 2016 dataset, we end up with 12,827 PCG segments for the normal class and 3,922 PCG segments for the abnormal class. 
To deal with the problem of highly imbalanced dataset, a balanced subset is constructed by including all the PCG segments from the abnormal class, while randomly selecting PCG segments from the normal class. This way, each of the two classes contain a total of 7,844 audio files (segments).  
The same process is repeated for the CirCor Digiscope 2022 dataset, where a total of 16,522 segments were extracted. We then utilized 6,571 files to construct as a more-balanced dataset as follows: 3,579 files from murmur absent class, 2,593 files from murmur present class, and 399 samples from the unknown class.


{\it Re-labeling of noise-only segments: }
The splitting of a PCG time-series into multiple smaller segments results in a new problem (i.e., how to assign labels to each segment). Note that a label (murmur present, murmur absent, unknown) was assigned to each recording as a whole by the annotator in the original dataset. However, when dividing a PCG signal into smaller segments, a situation arises where some segments are bad segments (i.e., they contain only noise, with no heartbeat at all!). If left untreated, feeding such noise-only segments to the deep learning model could have a negative impact on its performance. That is, the model will consider one such segment as representing a murmur. But in reality, the segment contains pure noise, and thus, should ideally be labeled as an unknown sample. Thus, to deal with this problem, a systematic method for assessment and re-labeling of each segment of the CirCor 2022 dataset is needed. 

{\it Graphical user interface for segment assessment and potential re-labeling:}
To this end, we developed a simple graphical user interface (GUI) in Python, in order to assess the quality of the default label for each segment in order to re-label all the noise-only segments, in a semi-automated fashion (see Fig. \ref{fig:annotator}). Specifically, the GUI of Fig. \ref{fig:annotator} shows the 2D time-frequency domain representation of each segment, as well as plays the audio. This allows us to systematically determine the presence or absence of heart beat in each segment, for all PCG files. Note that the re-labeling process made sure not to alter the integrity of the dataset. Specifically, the only allowed change was to re-label (murmur present) to (unknown), or (murmur absent) to (unknown) indicating that a certain segment of a whole recording doesn't actually represent a heartbeat signal, but rather contains only noise. In other words, no (murmur present) was changed to (murmur absent) or the other way around. Similarly, no (unknown) was changed to (murmur present) or (murmur absent). This exercise helped us identify the bad segments, which in turn helped us improve the training accuracy of our proposed DL classifiers. The resulting new distribution of the three classes (murmur present, murmur absent, and unknown) is summarized in Table II. 
%The interface is shown in figure \ref{fig:annotator}.

    \label{fig:murmur presence}
\end{figure*}

{\it Data normalization:}
For each data vector (segment), its mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is computed. Then, i-th element $x_i$ of each data vector is normalized by means of following operation: $x_{i,n}=\frac{x_i-\mu}{\sigma}$. The normalized data vector has zero mean and unit variance.

\subsection{Time-Frequency Analysis for Feature Extraction}
In order to study the feasibility of the two classification problems at hand, and in order to help our neural networks do automatic feature extraction, we transform the 1D audio PCG signals into their equivalent 2D representation using various time-frequency domain methods, e.g., short-time Fourier transform, mel-spectrograms, discrete and continuous wavelet transforms, and wavelet scattering transform (WST). We note that all but WST are not effective in differentiating between the three classes for the CirCor Digiscope 2022 dataset (the same holds for the PCG 2016 dataset). This is because WST is known to be effective for feature extraction, even for very small datasets. Therefore, we stick to WST for the rest of this work\footnote{Wavelet scattering is a technique that applies mathematical operations similar to those applied in convolutional layers. Specifically, WST utilizes wavelets as fixed convolutional filter, followed by a non-linearity (modulus operator), followed by averaging in order to find a low-variance representation of the data. }.

Fig. \ref{fig:murmur presence} provides a visual summary of two possible situations (murmur present, murmur absent) at each of the four heart valves. Specifically, Fig. \ref{fig:murmur presence} provides the audio PCG time-series as well as the wavelet scattering function for all possible scenarios. We conclude from Fig. \ref{fig:murmur presence} that wavelet scattering function indeed is effective in discriminating between the three classes for the CirCor Digiscope 2022 dataset. 



%short-time Fourier transform. This technique simply applies the transform over short windows of the whole signal, which results when concatenated in a 2D time-frequency representation of that signal. n-fft and hop-length. For an acoustic signal of 4 seconds and 4000 sampling rate, the best representation that gives balanced time-frequency resolution resulted of using n-fft of 64 samples and hop-length of 16 samples. Mel-spctrograms serve the same purpose, with one difference, which is that frequencies are converted to a mel-scale, which mimics the way a human ear perceives acoustic signals. 

%\section{PCG to ECG classification}

%\subsection{w-GAN method}
%Previous works [] has introduced methods for PPG to ECG translation. One of these works [] claims that their model is capable of translating any correlated pair of signals. We put their claim to the test by training the model to translate PCG signals to ECG signals.

\section{Heart Murmur \& Abnormal PCG Detection}

\subsection{Neural Network Architectures}
For heart murmur detection and abnormal PCG detection, we implemented and tested the following neural network (NN) architectures: convolutional neural network (CNN)--both 1D and 2D, recurrent neural network (RNN)\footnote{The motivation behind using the RNN (LSTM and GRU) is to exploit its capability to learn temporal dependencies between the samples of a time-series (audio PCG signals, in this work).}, combination of CNN and RNN, and residual network (ResNet). Eventually, it was the 1D-CNN model that resulted in maximum classification accuracy. Therefore, Fig. \ref{fig:CNN1D-Diagram} provides a detailed block diagram of the custom 1D-CNN model, with important parameters for each layer specified. One could see that the best-performer 1D-CNN model is relatively shallow, with 4 convolution layers (each followed by a pooling layer, followed by a batch normalization layer), a flattening layer, and 4 dense (fully connected) layers. Each (convolutional and dense) layer utilized RELU activation function, except the last layer which utilized softmax activation function. 

For the sake of completeness, Figs. \ref{fig:CRNN-Diagram}, \ref{fig:LSTM-Diagram} present the block diagrams of the two other neural network models implemented in this work: a C-RNN model, and a single-layer LSTM-RNN model (with tanh activation function). Finally, Fig. \ref{fig:methodology} provides the overall pictorial summary of our approach for heart murmur and abnormal PCG detection.

Note that we re-train our 1D-CNN model from scratch in order to do abnormal PCG detection on the PCG 2016 dataset later\footnote{We investigated transfer learning technique by reusing the 1D-CNN model trained on PCG 2022 dataset by testing it on PCG 2022 dataset, but without much success. This points to the fundamental different nature (distribution) of the two datasets.}.

\subsection{Training and Testing of NNs \& Hyper-parameters}

We implemented the custom 1D-CNN and LSTM-RNN models in Python using the PyTorch framework (in Microsoft visual studio environment), on a desktop PC with I5 7600 intel CPU and 1060ti Nvidia graphics card. The total available data for both datasets was divided into training data and test data using an 80-20 split, while making sure that test data is totally unique (i.e., the test data is not seen by the models during the training stage). For backpropagation purpose, the cross-entropy loss function was used. Table \ref{table:HyperParameters} summarizes the important hyper-parameters for the 1D-CNN model and the LSTM-RNN model when trained on both datasets.

    \end{tabular}
    \label{table:HyperParameters}
\end{table}

We conducted a total of four experiments by training the custom 1D-CNN and LSTM-RNN on the two datasets, in order to do: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item E1) murmur detection using the original PCG 2022 dataset with 3 classes (murmur present, murmur absent, unknown).
    \item E2) murmur detection using a subset of the PCG 2022 dataset with 2 classes (murmur present, murmur absent) with unknown class excluded. 
    \item E3) murmur detection with 3 classes using the cleaned PCG 2022 dataset after re-labeling of noise-only segments, as discussed in previous section. 
    \item E4) abnormal PCG detection using the PCG 2016 dataset. 

\end{itemize}

Fig. \ref{fig:murmur3-loss-acc} shows that the loss as well as the accuracy settles in about 150 epochs during both the training and the validation phase, for experiment E1. Fig. \ref{fig:murmur2-loss-acc} shows that the loss and accuracy settle much quickly (in about 10 epochs), for experiment E2 (due to the removal of the unknown class with noisy samples). The loss and accuracy plots for experiments E3 and E4 show a similar trend, and thus, are omitted for the sake of brevity.

\section{Experimental Results}

We first describe the performance metrics used to evaluate the 1D-CNN and other classifiers, followed by a discussion of the key results for the three experiments E1, E2, E3 on murmur detection using the three variants of the PCG 2022 dataset, followed by a discussion of selected results for the fourth experiment E4 on abnormal PCG detection using PCG 2016 dataset. 

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

We use accuracy and F1-score as the main performance evaluation metrics. Since accuracy is most meaningful for a balanced dataset, we minimized the class imbalance by reducing the size of the murmur present class in both datasets. Additionally, weighted accuracy is also used as a performance metric for comparison with other contestants of the Physionet challenge 2022.

\subsubsection{Accuracy}
The accuracy of a dataset is the ratio of number of correct predictions $S_c$ by the model and total number of samples $S_t$: $A = \frac{S_c}{S_t} \times 100 $. 

\subsubsection{Weighted Accuracy}
The weighted accuracy is a metric that gives more weight to the patients with murmur, and is defined as:

$A_w = \frac{5m_{pp} + 3m_{uu} + m_{aa}}{5(m_{pp} + m_{up} + m_{ap}) + 3(m_{pu} + m_{uu} + m_{au}) + (m_{pa} + m_{ua} + m_{aa})}$
where $m_{xx}$ is defined as in Table \ref{table:murmur_expert}.

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}




\subsubsection{F1-Score}
F1-score is a statistical measure that depends upon two factors, precision and recall. Precision is obtained by dividing total number of correctly classified elements, i.e. True Positives by total positively classified elements, i.e. True Positives (TP) + False Positives (FP). Thus, $P = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$. Recall is obtained by dividing total number of positively classified samples by the total number of samples that should had been marked as positive, i.e., True Positives and True Positives + False Negatives (FN) respectively. Thus, $R = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} $.
With precision and recall in hand, F1-score is calculated as: $F1 = 2 * \frac{P*R}{P+R}$, where $P$ is precision and $R$ is recall.

\subsection{Results: Murmur detection using PCG 2022 dataset}

{\it Performance of 1D-CNN:}
First, we report the results obtained by the best-performing 1D-CNN model. For experiment E1 that does murmur detection using PCG 2022 dataset with three classes, we obtained a maximum accuracy of 82.28\%, 83.81\% weighted accuracy, and 90\% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (see the confusion matrix in Fig. \ref{fig:cf-2022} (a)). On the other hand, the experiment E2 that does murmur detection using PCG 2022 dataset with two classes (with unknown class with low-quality audios removed), resulted in an improved accuracy of 87.66\%, elevated F1-score of 0.87, and higher AUROC of 92.28\% (see the confusion matrix in Fig. \ref{fig:cf-2022} (b)). Finally, for experiment E3 that does murmur detection using PCG 2022 dataset with three classes (after re-labeling), the weighted accuracy improved to 86\% and AUROC rose to 93\% (see Fig. \ref{fig:cf-2022} (c)). This resulted in a more balanced confusion matrix for experiment E3 as before the re-labeling process, only 17\% of the unknown class samples were correctly detected in experiment E1, but now it increases to 80\% after the re-labeling process in experiment E3. This could also be verified by comparing the F1-scores for experiments E1 and E3. 

{\it Selection of optimal segment size:}
We repeated our experiment E1 (where we utilize the original PCG 2022 dataset as is) with different segment sizes (i.e., 1 sec, 3 sec, 4 sec, and 5s), and assessed the performance of our 1D-CNN model with the aim to find an optimal segment size (see Table \ref{table:window_impact}). We utilize F1-score as the core performance metric to select the optimal segment size (this is because the accuracy is not a reliable performance metric for the imbalanced datasets). Furthermore, we observed that overlapping segments cause extreme over-fitting; therefore, we ended up selecting non-overlapping segments of duration 4 seconds. 

%so compared with 4s before cleaning as well.

We note that our 1D-CNN model outperforms both LSTM-RNN and CRNN models in terms of accuracy, weighted accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and AUROC, for experiment E3 (which does murmur detection on the cleaned dataset).

{\it Performance comparison with the state-of-the-art:}
Table \ref{table:murmur-reannotated-results} provides a thorough comparison of the performance achieved by the top three contestants in the Physionet 2022 challenge, with the performance achieved by our NN models: 1D-CNN, LSTM-RNN, and CRNN. Table \ref{table:murmur-reannotated-results} demonstrates that our 1D-CNN model outperforms all the three top contestants in terms of accuracy, weighted accuracy, F1-score and AUROC, for both experiments E1 (which does murmur detection on the original dataset) and E3 (which does murmur detection on the cleaned dataset).

\subsection{Results: Abnormal PCG detection using PCG 2016 dataset}

As mentioned in the previous section, we re-train our 1D-CNN model from scratch on PCG 2016 dataset in order to differentiate between a normal PCG signal and an abnormal PCG signal. The hyper-parameters of the 1D-CNN that was fine-tuned for PCG 2016 dataset could be found in Table \ref{table:HyperParameters}. Specifically, for the abnormal PCG detection problem, the model achieved 96.30\% accuracy, and 98.17\% AUROC (see Fig. \ref{fig:cf-2016} and Table \ref{table:2016-results}).

\section{Conclusion}

This work utilized two public datasets, i.e., CirCor Digiscope 2022 dataset and PCG 2016 datasets (from Physionet online database) in order to train three deep learning classifiers, i.e., 1D-CNN, LSTM-RNN, and C-RNN to do heart murmur detection as well as abnormal PCG detection. We observed that our 1D-CNN outperformed the other two NNs as well as the state-of-the-art, with an accuracy of 82.86\%, weighted accuracy of 86.30\%, and F1-score of 81.87\% (for experiment E3 which does murmur detection after re-labeling of noise-only segments). 

We note that the CirCor Digiscope 2022 dataset also contains other valuable information about the murmurs, e.g., murmur grading, timing, quality, pitch, shape etc. Thus, design of novel machine/deep learning algorithms which could do automatic and accurate murmur grading analysis with little data is an open problem of great interest. Furthermore, study of generative methods which could reliably generate synthetic PCG data in order to help train the data hungry deep learning methods is another interesting but challenging open problem (due to non-stationary nature of PCG signals with murmurs).

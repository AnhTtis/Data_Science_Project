    "abstract": "We show that for any connected smooth manifold $M$ of dimension different from $3$ the restriction of the compact-open topology to the diffeomorphism group of $M$ is minimal, i.e. the group does not admit a strictly coarser Hausdorff group topology. This implies the minimality of the compact-open topology on the homeomorphism group of $M$ in all dimensions different from $3$ and $4$. In those cases for which in addition to all of this automatic continuity is known to hold, such as when $M$ is closed, one can conclude that the compact-open topology is the unique separable Hausdorff group topology on the homeomorphism group.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the vortex phase diagram of needle shaped high quality NiBi3 single crystals by transport measurements. The current is applied along the crystalline b-axis of this intermetallic quasi-1D BCS superconductor. The single crystals show a Ginzburg-Levanchuk (Gi) parameter few orders of magnitude larger than other low Tc BCS superconductors. Vortex phase diagram, critical currents and pinning forces have been extracted from the experimental data. The main findings are: 1) Enhancement of the vortex liquid phase in comparison with low Tc superconductors, 2) reentrance of the liquid phase at low fields and 3) deviation of the pinning force vs field from the usual pinning mechanisms. The interplay between weak pinning, due to quenched disorder, and the quasi-1D character of the material could be a hint to explain the lack of a single pinning mechanism.",

    "abstract": "A knot $K$ in a directed graph $D$ is a strongly connected component of size at least two such that there is no arc $(u,v)$ with $u \\in V(K)$ and $v\\notin V(K)$. Given a directed graph $D=(V,E)$, we study Knot-Free Vertex Deletion (KFVD), where the goal is to remove the minimum number of vertices such that the resulting graph contains no knots. This problem naturally emerges from its application in deadlock resolution since knots are deadlocks in the OR-model of distributed computation. The fastest known exact algorithm in literature for KFVD runs in time $\\mathcal{O}^\\star(1.576^n)$. In this paper, we present an improved exact algorithm running in time $\\mathcal{O}^\\star(1.4549^n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $D$. We also prove that the number of inclusion wise minimal knot-free vertex deletion sets is $\\mathcal{O}^\\star(1.4549^n)$ and construct a family of graphs with $Ω(1.4422^n)$ minimal knot-free vertex deletion sets",

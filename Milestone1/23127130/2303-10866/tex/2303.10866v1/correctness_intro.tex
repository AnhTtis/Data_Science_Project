In this section we prove that  Algorithm KFVD returns an optimal knot-free vertex deletion set for any input instance. Let \emph{Subroutine $0$} represent the lines $1-6$ of the algorithm. The correctness of lines $5-6$, $1-2$ and $3-4$ follow from Reduction Rules \ref{rr1}, \ref{rr2} and \ref{rr3} respectively. We use the terms \emph{Subroutine $1$}, \emph{Subroutine $2$}, \emph{Subroutine $3$} and \emph{Subroutine $4$} to refer to lines $7$-$10$, $12$-$15$, $17$-$27$ and $28$-$32$ of Algorithm \KFProb~respectively. The correctness of the subroutines are verified in the following sections.

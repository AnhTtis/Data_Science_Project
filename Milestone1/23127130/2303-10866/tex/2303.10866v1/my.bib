abstract = {This paper explores a dynamic programming approach to the solution of three sequencing problems: a scheduling problem involving arbitrary cost functions, the traveling-salesman problem, and an assembly line balancing problem. Each of the problems is shown to admit of numerical solution through the use of a simple recursion scheme; these recursion schemes also exhibit similarities and contrasts in the structures of the three problems. For large problems, direct solution by means of dynamic programming is not practical, but procedures are given for obtaining good approximate results by solving sequences of smaller derived problems. Experience with a computer program for the solution of traveling-salesman problems is presented.},

It covers the core material of the subject with concise yet reliably complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced methods in each field by one or two deeper results, again with proofs given in full detail. The book can be used as a reliable text for an introductory course, as a graduate text, and for self-study. From the reviews: This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory. Acta Scientiarum Mathematiciarum Deep, clear, wonderful. This is a serious book about the heart of graph theory. It has depth and integrity. Persi Diaconis & Ron Graham, SIAM Review The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory.

abstract = {Today most computer scientists believe that NP-hard problems cannot be solved by polynomial-time algorithms. From the polynomial-time perspective, all NP-complete problems are equivalent but their exponential-time properties vary widely. Why do some NP-hard problems appear to be easier than others? Are there algorithmic techniques for solving hard problems that are significantly faster than the exhaustive, brute-force methods? The algorithms that address these questions are known as exact exponential algorithms.The history of exact exponential algorithms for NP-hard problems dates back to the 1960s. The two classical examples are Bellman, Held and Karps dynamic programming algorithm for the traveling salesman problem and Rysers inclusionexclusion formula for the permanent of a matrix. The design and analysis of exact algorithms leads to a better understanding of hard problems and initiates interesting new combinatorial and algorithmic challenges. The last decade has witnessed a rapid development of the area, with many new algorithmic techniques discovered. This has transformed exact algorithms into a very active research field. This book provides an introduction to the area and explains the most common algorithmic techniques, and the text is supported throughout with exercises and detailed notes for further reading.The book is intended for advanced students and researchers in computer science, operations research, optimization and combinatorics.}

A deadlock occurs in a distributed system when a group of processes waits indefinitely for resources from each other. Distributed systems are usually represented by wait-for graphs, where the behavior of a process is determined by a deadlock model. In this paper, we revisit deadlock model concepts, and present a new deadlock model as a simpler alternative to the And/Or model. Using also computational complexity and circuit complexity aspects, we provide a novel analysis of the hierarchy of classical deadlock models, where we identify how expressive each model is from the point of view of polynomial computations. Finally we present a generic graph structure to characterize deadlock situations.},

This has allowed us to formulate deadlock prevention in terms of prohibiting the occurrence of directed cycles even in the most general of wait models (the so-called AND-OR model, in which prohibiting wait-for directed cycles is generally overly restrictive). For a particular case in which the priority digraphs are somewhat simplified, we introduce a Las Vegas probabilistic mechanism for resource granting and analyze its key aspects in detail. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The graph coloring problem is the problem of partitioning the vertices of a graph into the smallest possible set of independent&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; sets. Since it is a well-known NP-Hard problem, it is of great interest of the computer science finding results over exact algorithms that solve it. The main algorithms of this kind, though, are scattered through the literature. In this paper, we group and contextualize some of these algorithms, which are based in Dynamic Programming, Branch-and-Bound and Integer Linear Programming. The algorithms for the first group are based in the work of Lawler, which searches maximal independent sets on each subset of vertices of a graph as the base of his algorithm. In the second group, the algorithms are based in the work of Brelaz, which adapted the DSATUR procedure to an exact version, and in the work of Zykov, which introduced the definition of Zykov trees. The third group contains the algorithms based in the work of Mehrotra and Trick, which uses the Column Generation method.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

abstract = {We give a new general approach for designing exact exponential-time algorithms for subset problems. In a subset problem the input implicitly describes a family of sets over a universe of size n and the task is to determine whether the family contains at least one set. A typical example of a subset problem is Weighted d-SAT. Here, the input is a CNF-formula with clauses of size at most d, and an integer W. The universe is the set of variables and the variables have integer weights. The family contains all the subsets S of variables such that the total weight of the variables in S does not exceed W, and setting the variables in S to 1 and the remaining variables to 0 satisfies the formula. Our approach is based on “monotone local search”, where the goal is to extend a partial solution to a solution by adding as few elements as possible. More formally, in the extension problem we are also given as input a subset X of the universe and an integer k. The task is to determine whether one can add at most k elements to X to obtain a set in the (implicitly defined) family. Our main result is that a cknO(1) time algorithm for the extension problem immediately yields a randomized algorithm for finding a solution of any size with running time O((2−1/c)n). In many cases, the extension problem can be reduced to simply finding a solution of size at most k. Furthermore, efficient algorithms for finding small solutions have been extensively studied in the field of parameterized algorithms. Directly applying these algorithms, our theorem yields in one stroke significant improvements over the best known exponential-time algorithms for several well-studied problems, including d-Hitting Set, Feedback Vertex Set, Node Unique Label Cover, and Weighted d-SAT. Our results demonstrate an interesting and very concrete connection between parameterized algorithms and exact exponential-time algorithms. We also show how to derandomize our algorithms at the cost of a subexponential multiplicative factor in the running time. Our derandomization is based on an efficient construction of a new pseudo-random object that might be of independent interest. Finally, we extend our methods to establish new combinatorial upper bounds and develop enumeration algorithms.},

    abstract = { Over the past decade, many results have focused on the design of parameterized approximation algorithms for W[1]-hard problems. However, there are fundamental problems within the class FPT for which the best known algorithms have seen no progress over the course of the decade; some of them have even been proved not to admit algorithms that run in time 2(k) n(1) under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) or (c – ∊)k n(1) under the Strong ETH (SETH). In this paper, we expand the study of FPT-approximation and initiate a systematic study of FPT-approximation for problems that are FPT. We design FPT-approximation algorithms for problems that are FPT, with running times that are significantly faster than the corresponding best known FPT-algorithm, and while achieving approximation ratios that are significantly better than what is possible in polynomial time. We present a general scheme to design 2(k) n(1)-time 2-approximation algorithms for cut problems. In particular, we exemplify it for Directed Feedback Vertex Set, Directed Subset Feedback Vertex Set, Directed Odd Cycle Transversal and Undirected Multicut. Further, we extend our scheme to obtain FPT-time (1)-approximation algorithms for weighted cut problems, where the objective is to obtain a solution of size at most k and of minimum weight. Here, we present two approaches. The first approach achieves 2(k) n(1)-time constant-factor approximation, which we exemplify for all problems mentioned in the first bullet. The other leads to an FPT-approximation Scheme (FPT-AS) for Weighted Directed Feedback Vertex Set. Additionally, we present a combinatorial lemma that yields a partition of the vertex set of a graph to roughly equal sized sets so that the removal of each set reduces its treewidth substantially, which may be of independent interest. For several graph problems, use this lemma to design cwn(1)-time (1 + ∊)-approximation algorithms that are faster than known SETH lower bounds, where w is the treewidth of the input graph. Examples of such problems include Vertex Cover, Component Order Connectivity, Bounded-Degree Vertex Deletion and ℱ-Packing for any family ℱ of bounded sized graphs. Lastly, we present a general reduction of problems parameterized by treewidth to their versions parameterized by solution size. Combined with our first scheme, we exemplify it to obtain cwn(1)-time bicriteria approximation algorithms for all problems mentioned in the first bullet. }

More precisely, given a "snapshot" graph G representing a deadlocked state of a distributed computation governed by a certain deadlock model $${mathbb {M}}$$M, we investigate the complexity of vertex/arc deletion problems that aim at finding minimum vertex/arc subsets whose removal turns G into a deadlock-free graph (according to model $${mathbb {M}}$$M). Our contributions include polynomial-time algorithms and hardness proofs, for general graphs and for special graph classes.

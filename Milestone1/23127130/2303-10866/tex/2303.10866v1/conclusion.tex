We obtain a $\mathcal{O}(1.4549^n)$ time algorithm for the \KFProb problem which uses polynomial space. We also obtain an upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(1.4549^n)$ on the number of minimal knot-free vertex deletion sets possible for any directed graph and present a family of graphs which have $1.4422^n$ many minimal knot-free vertex deletion sets. Our algorithm is not proven to be optimal and improving it is a possible direction for future work. Closing the gap between the upper and lower bound for the maximum number of knot-free vertex deletion sets is also of interest.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the following free boundary problem $$ (P)\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} Δu = λφ(x)\\Sum_{i=1}^n H(u-μ_i )& \\quad \\mbox{ in }\\ Ω=Ω_2\\setminus \\overlineΩ_1, \\\\[0.3cm]u =0 &\\quad \\mbox{ on } \\partial Ω_2, \\\\[0.3cm]u =M &\\quad \\mbox{ on } \\partial Ω_1. \\end{array} \\right. $$ The domain $Ω$ is a convex ring where $Ω_1$ and $Ω_2$ are bounded convex domain in $\\mathbb{R}^N,$ $N\\geq 2,$ $H$ is the Heaviside step function, $λ, M,μ_i$ $(i=1,..,n)$ are a given positive real parameters and $φ$ is a given function . We show that under suitable conditions, there exists a solution to problem $(P)$ with a convex level set. We derive also an interesting result for the convexity of the set which is delimited by the free boundary in obstacle problem when the nonlinearity is discontinuous. At last, a detailed analysis is given by a construction of function $φ$ which show that there are more solutions.",

abstract = {Active noise control (ANC) is broadly used to cancel the unwanted disturbance in different fields because of its excellent performance in abating low-frequency noise. In practice, however, the limited driving capability of actuators restrict the maximum output power of ANC systems. Once the driving signal of the ANC system exceeds these limitations, the inherent nonlinearity of the actuators will deteriorate the noise reduction and may result in the divergence of the adaptive algorithm. Hence, the two-gradient direction filtered-x least mean square (2GD-FXLMS) algorithm based on the optimal Kuhn-Tucker solution with the output constraint is proposed in this paper. This algorithm has the advantage of minimizing system overdriving, maintaining a specified power budget, and enhancing system stability. Compared to existing output-constrained adaptive algorithms, this proposed algorithm has the same computational complexity as the conventional FXLMS algorithm, while maintaining a stricter output constraint that minimizes the saturation distortion.}

abstract = {The feedforward active noise control (FF ANC) technique has been widely used to cancel the broadband noise in many practical applications. However, it fails to cope with the uncorrelated narrow-band disturbance picked up by the error sensor, which is independent of the reference signal picked up by the reference sensor. Hence, the alternative switching hybrid ANC has been proposed in the paper to attenuate this kind of uncorrelated narrow-band disturbance effectively. Furthermore, compared with the conventional hybrid ANC algorithms, the proposed algorithm alternatively switches to do updating between the feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) ANC. The algorithm, thus, saves the computations and achieves a faster convergence speed. The numerical simulations and real-time experiments in the paper validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which exhibits better convergence and noise reduction performance than other hybrid active control algorithms.}

abstract = {Active noise control (ANC) is now a must-have feature in various headphones to attenuate unwanted external noise leaked into the headphones. The conventional ANC headphone typically uses an earcup-mounted reference microphone to pick up the reference signal and send it to the chip’s control filter, which generates anti-noise inside the earcup to destructively interfere with the leaky noise signal. Previously, a novel type of wireless feedforward ANC structure was devised to achieve greater noise reduction by acquiring a higher reference-to-interference ratio. To further reduce computational complexity and relax causality constraints over traditional ANC algorithms, a modification to this structure is proposed that employs a hybrid feedforward–feedback structure in conjunction with a fixed-adaptive control selection (FAS). Furthermore, numerical simulations and real-time experiments are performed in this paper to validate the effectiveness of the wireless hybrid ANC with the FAS technique.}

abstract = {This paper considers the active control of road noise in vehicles, using either multichannel feedback control, with both headrest and floor positioned microphones providing feedback error signals, or multichannel feedforward control, in which reference signals are provided by the microphones on the vehicle floor and error signals are provided by the microphones mounted on the headrests. The formulation of these control problems is shown to be similar if the constraints of robust stability, limited disturbance enhancement and open-loop stability are imposed. A novel formulation is presented for disturbance enhancement in multichannel systems, which limits the maximum enhancement of each individual error signal. The performance of these two systems is predicted using plant responses and disturbance signals measured in a small city car. The reduction in the sum of the squared pressure signals at the four error microphones for both systems is found to be up to 8dB at low frequencies and 3dB on average, where the sound level is particularly high from 80 to 180Hz. The performance of both systems is found to be robust to measured variations in the plant responses. The enhancements in the disturbance at higher frequencies are smaller for the feedback controller than for the feedforward controller, although the performance of the feedback controller is more significantly reduced by the introduction of additional delay in the plant response.}

    "abstract": "In recent years, much attention has been paid to the study of forward and inverse problems for the Rayleigh-Stokes equation in connection with the importance of this equation for applications. This equation plays an important role, in particular, in the study of the behavior of certain non-Newtonian fluids. The equation includes a fractional derivative of order $α$, which is used to describe the viscoelastic behavior of the flow. In this paper, we study the behavior of the solution of such equations depending on the parameter $α$. In particular, it is proved that for sufficiently large $t$ the norm $||u(x,t)||_{L_2(Ω)}$ of the solution decreases with respect to $α$. Moreover the inverse problem of determining the order of the derivative $α$ is solved uniquely.",

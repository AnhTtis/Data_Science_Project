abstract = {The quality of experiments designed using standard optimisation-based techniques can be adversely affected by poor starting values of the parameters. Thus, there is a necessity for design methods that are insensitive (â€œrobustâ€) to these starting values. Here, two novel, robust criteria are presented for computing optimal dynamic inputs for experiments aiming at improving parameter precision, based on previously proposed methods for providing design robustnessÂ â€” the expected value criterion and the maxâ€“min criterion. In this paper, both criteria are extended by use of the information matrix derived for dynamic systems. The experiment design problem is cast as an optimal control problem, with experiment decision variables such as sampling times of response variables, time-varying and time-invariant external controls, experiment duration, and initial conditions. Comparisons are made of experiment designs obtained using the conventional approach and the newly proposed criteria. A typical semi-continuous bioreactor application is presented.}

 abstract = {This paper reviews the literature on Bayesian experimental design. A unified view of this topic is presented, based on a decision-theoretic approach. This framework casts criteria from the Bayesian literature of design as part of a single coherent approach. The decision-theoretic structure incorporates both linear and nonlinear design problems and it suggests possible new directions to the experimental design problem, motivated by the use of new utility functions. We show that, in some special cases of linear design problems, Bayesian solutions change in a sensible way when the prior distribution and the utility function are modified to allow for the specific structure of the experiment. The decision-theoretic approach also gives a mathematical justification for selecting the appropriate optimality criterion.},

The model incorporates the role of a recently discovered protein complex made up of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cbl, the guanine exchange factor (GEF), Cool-1 (Î²-Pix) and the Rho family G protein Cdc42. The complex has been suggested to be important in disrupting receptor down-regulation. We demonstrate that the model interactions can accurately reproduce the experimental observations, that they can be used to make predictions with accompanying uncertainties, and that we can apply ideas of optimal experimental design to suggest new experiments that reduce the uncertainty on unmeasurable components of the system.},

We propose motion coordination algorithms that steer the mobile sensor network to an optimal deployment and that are amenable to a decentralized implementation. Finally, our numerical simulations illustrate how the proposed algorithms lead to improved performance of an extended Kalman filter in a target-tracking scenario.}

abstract={This paper provides a brief introduction to forecasting in financial markets with emphasis on commodity futures and foreign exchange. We describe the basic approaches to forecasting, and discuss the noisy nature of financial data. Using neural networks as a learning paradigm, we describe different techniques for choosing the inputs, outputs, and error function. We also describe the learning from hints technique that augments the standard learning from examples method. We demonstrate the use of hints in foreign-exchange trading of the U.S. Dollar versus the British Pound, the German Mark, the Japanese Yen, and the Swiss Franc, over a period of 32 months. The paper does not assume a background in financial markets.},

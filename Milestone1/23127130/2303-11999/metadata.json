    "abstract": "The classical Pieri formula gives a multiplicity free expansion of an irreducible module with a fundamental one for the complex general linear group. In this article we replace the tensor product by the fusion product and prove an analogue Pieri formula for higher level Demazure modules for the affine Lie algebra $\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}_{n+1}$. To be more precise, we show that the fusion product of an arbitrary stable Demazure module with a fundamental module admits a multiplicity free excellent filtration and the successive quotients are described explicitly. As a consequence, we derive recurrence relations for the generating series encoding the numerical multiplicities in Demazure flags of level one Demazure modules.",

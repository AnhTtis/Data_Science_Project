    "abstract": "The number of available genomes of prokaryotic organisms is rapidly growing enabling comparative genomics studies. The comparison of genomes of organisms with a common phenotype, habitat or phylogeny often shows that these genomes share some common contents. Collecting rules expressing common genome traits depending on given factors is useful, as such rules could be used for quality control or for identifying interesting exceptions and formulating hypothesis. Automatizing the rules verification using computation tools requires the definition of a representation schema. In this study, we present EGC (Expected Genome Contents), a flat-text file format for the representation of expectation rules about the content of prokaryotic genomes. A parser for the EGC format has been implemented using the TextFormats software library, accompanied by a set of related Python packages.",

    "abstract": "We study the worst case tractability of multivariate linear problems defined on separable Hilbert spaces. Information about a problem instance consists of noisy evaluations of arbitrary bounded linear functionals, where the noise is either deterministic or random. The cost of a single evaluation depends on its precision and is controlled by a cost function. We establish mutual interactions between tractability of a problem with noisy information, the cost function, and tractability of the same problem, but with exact information.",

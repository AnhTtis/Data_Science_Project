    "abstract": "Consider a normal location model $X \\mid θ\\sim N(θ, σ^2)$ with known $σ^2$. Suppose $θ\\sim G_0$, where the prior $G_0$ has zero mean and unit variance. Let $G_1$ be a possibly misspecified prior with zero mean and unit variance. We show that the squared error Bayes risk of the posterior mean under $G_1$ is bounded, uniformly over $G_0, G_1, σ^2 > 0$.",

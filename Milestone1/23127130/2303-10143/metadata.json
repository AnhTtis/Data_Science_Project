    "abstract": "We review a recent generalization of Normal Form Theory to systems (Hamiltonian ones or general ODEs) where the perturbing term is not periodic in one coordinate variable. The main difference with the standard case relies on the non uniqueness of the Normal Form and the total absence of the small divisors problem. The exposition is quite general, so as to allow extensions to the case of more non--periodic coordinates, and more functional settings. Here, for simplicity, we work in the real--analytic class.",

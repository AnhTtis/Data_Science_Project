    "abstract": "We discuss recent developments towards next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in the dipole picture. We review recent NLO results for exclusive vector meson production and diffractive structure functions, and discuss how it is becoming possible to describe both inclusive and exclusive DIS data simultaneously within the Color Glass Condensate framework at NLO accuracy. These developments will make it possible to probe the gluon saturation phenomena in detail especially when nuclear-DIS data from the EIC become available.",

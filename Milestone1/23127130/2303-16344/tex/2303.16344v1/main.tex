\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Diversity and inclusion (D\&I) in open source software (OSS) is a multifaceted concept that arises from differences in contributors' gender, seniority, language, region, and other characteristics. D\&I has received growing attention in OSS ecosystems and projects, and various programs have been implemented to foster contributor diversity. However, we do not yet know how the state of D\&I is evolving. By understanding the state of D\&I in OSS projects, the community can develop new and adjust current strategies to foster diversity among contributors and gain insights into the mechanisms and processes that facilitate the development of inclusive communities. In this paper, we report and compare the results of two surveys of Apache Software Foundation (ASF) contributors conducted over two years (n=624 \& n=432), considering a variety of D\&I aspects. We see improvements in engagement among those traditionally underrepresented in OSS, particularly those who are in gender minority or not confident in English. Yet, the gender gap in the number of contributors remains. We expect this study to help communities tailor their efforts in promoting D\&I in OSS.

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent

% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)


% \begin{IEEEbiography}
% [{\includegraphics[width=0.8in,height=1in,clip,keepaspectratio]{pic/feng.png}}]{Zixuan Feng} is a Ph.D. student at Oregon State University in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer science.

% % if you will not have a photo at all:

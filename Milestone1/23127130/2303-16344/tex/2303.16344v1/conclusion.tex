\section{Conclusion and Future work}

In this study, we conducted a longitudinal approach to investigate the evolution of D\&I within a large OSS organization by conducting two cross-sectional surveys in Apache projects. Our findings show that the obstacles and challenges resulting from diverse backgrounds and experiences are on the path to improvement, particularly for contributors from groups that are traditionally considered underrepresented.

To continue promoting an inclusive community and organizing D\&I activities, it is necessary to keep informing contributors in privileged positions about the state of D\&I, particularly the challenges and bias on minority contributors. In the future, we plan to keep these longitudinal studies to continue monitoring and investigating the state of D\&I in the community, attracting more contributors' attention and eliminating challenges from D\&I-related bias.

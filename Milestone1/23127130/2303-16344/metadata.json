    "abstract": "Diversity and inclusion in open source software (OSS) is a multifaceted concept that arises from differences in contributors' gender, seniority, language, region, and other characteristics. D&I has received growing attention in OSS ecosystems and projects, and various programs have been implemented to foster contributor diversity. However, we do not yet know how the state of D&I is evolving. By understanding the state of D&I in OSS projects, the community can develop new and adjust current strategies to foster diversity among contributors and gain insights into the mechanisms and processes that facilitate the development of inclusive communities. In this paper, we report and compare the results of two surveys of Apache Software Foundation (ASF) contributors conducted over two years (n=624 & n=432), considering a variety of D&I aspects. We see improvements in engagement among those traditionally underrepresented in OSS, particularly those who are in gender minority or not confident in English. Yet, the gender gap in the number of contributors remains. We expect this study to help communities tailor their efforts in promoting D&I in OSS.",

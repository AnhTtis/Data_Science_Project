    "abstract": "The rise of machine learning has greatly influenced the field of computational chemistry, and that of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in particular. One of its most exciting prospects is the development of accurate, full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) for molecules and clusters, which, however, often require thousands to tens of thousands of ab initio data points restricting the community to medium sized molecules and/or lower levels of theory (e.g. DFT). Transfer learning, which improves a global PES from a lower to a higher level of theory, offers a data efficient alternative requiring only a fraction of the high level data (on the order of 100 are found to be sufficient for malonaldehyde). The present work demonstrates that even with Hartree-Fock theory and a double-zeta basis set as the lower level model, transfer learning yields CCSD(T)-level quality for H-transfer barrier energies, harmonic frequencies and H-transfer tunneling splittings. Most importantly, finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations on the sub-microsecond time scale in the gas phase are possible and the infrared spectra determined from the transfer learned PESs are in good agreement with experiment. It is concluded that routine, long-time atomistic simulations on PESs fulfilling CCSD(T)-standards become possible.",

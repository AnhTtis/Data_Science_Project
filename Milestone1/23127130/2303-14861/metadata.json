    "abstract": "For a non-relativistic scale invariant system in two spatial dimensions, the quantum scattering amplitude $f(θ)$ is given as a dispersion relation, with a simple closed form for ${\\rm Im}(f(θ)$) as well as the integrated cross-section $σ\\propto {\\rm Im}(f(θ=0))$. For fixed $θ\\neq 0$, the classical limit is straightforward to obtain.",

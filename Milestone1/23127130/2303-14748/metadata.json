    "abstract": "We present an error analysis of weak convergence of one-step numerical schemes for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with super-linearly growing coefficients. Following Milstein's weak error analysis on the one-step approximation of SDEs, we prove a general conclusion on weak convergence of the one-step discretization of the SDEs mentioned above. As applications, we show the weak convergence rates for several numerical schemes of half-order strong convergence, such as tamed and balanced schemes. Numerical examples are presented to verify our theoretical analysis.",

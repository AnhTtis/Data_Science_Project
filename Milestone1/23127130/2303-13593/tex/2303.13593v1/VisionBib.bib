This approach improves the camera pose for images lacking stable point features but where straight line segments are available. The line matching algorithm is divided into two stages: At first, scale-invariant feature points along the lines are matched incorporating a one-dimensional homography. Then, corresponding line segments are selected based on the quality of the estimated homography and epipolar constraints. Based on two line segment correspondences the relative orientation between two images can be calculated.",

abstract = {A new approach is proposed for reconstructing 3D lines and cameras from 2D corresponding lines across multiple uncalibrated views. There is no requirement that the 2D corresponding lines on different images represent the same segment of a 3D line, which may not appear on all images. A 3D line is reconstructed by minimizing a geometric cost function that measures the distance of the reprojected end points of the 3D segment from the measured 2D lines on different images. An algorithmic procedure is provided with guaranteed convergence to a solution where the geometric cost function achieves a (local) minimum.},

There is no requirement that the 2D corresponding lines on different images represent the same segment of a 3D line, which may not appear on all images. A 3D line is reconstructed by minimizing a geometric cost function that measures the distance of the reprojected end points of the 3D segment from the measured 2D lines on different images. An algorithmic procedure is provided with guaranteed convergence to a solution where the geometric cost function achieves a (local) minimum.},

abstract = {We address the problem of camera motion and 3D structure reconstruction from line correspondences across multiple views, from initialization to final bundle adjustment. One of the main difficulties when dealing with line features is their algebraic representation. First, we consider the triangulation problem. Based on Plücker coordinates to represent the 3D lines, we propose a maximum likelihood algorithm, relying on linearizing the Plücker constraint and on a Plücker correction procedure, computing the closest Plücker coordinates to a given 6-vector. Second, we consider the bundle adjustment problem, which is essentially a nonlinear optimization process on camera motion and 3D line parameters. Previous overparameterizations of 3D lines induce gauge freedoms and/or internal consistency constraints. We propose the orthonormal representation, which allows handy nonlinear optimization of 3D lines using the minimum four parameters with an unconstrained optimization engine. We compare our algorithms to existing ones on simulated and real data. Results show that our triangulation algorithm outperforms standard linear and bias-corrected quasi-linear algorithms, and that bundle adjustment using our orthonormal representation yields results similar to the standard maximum likelihood trifocal tensor algorithm, while being usable for any number of views.}

abstract = {This paper discusses the basic role of the trifocal tensor in scene reconstruction from three views. This 3× 3× 3 tensor plays a role in the analysis of scenes from three views analogous to the role played by the fundamental matrix in the two-view case. In particular, the trifocal tensor may be computed by a linear algorithm from a set of 13 line correspondences in three views. It is further shown in this paper, that the trifocal tensor is essentially identical to a set of coefficients introduced by Shashua to effect point transfer in the three view case. This observation means that the 13-line algorithm may be extended to allow for the computation of the trifocal tensor given any mixture of sufficiently many line and point correspondences. From the trifocal tensor the camera matrices of the images may be computed, and the scene may be reconstructed. For unrelated uncalibrated cameras, this reconstruction will be unique up to projectivity. Thus, projective reconstruction of a set of lines and points may be carried out linearly from three views.}

abstract="We present a complete classification of minimal problems for generic arrangements of points and lines in space observed partially by three calibrated perspective cameras when each line is incident to at most one point. This is a large class of interesting minimal problems that allows missing observations in images due to occlusions and missed detections. There is an infinite number of such minimal problems; however, we show that they can be reduced to 140616 equivalence classes by removing superfluous features and relabeling the cameras. We also introduce camera-minimal problems, which are practical for designing minimal solvers, and show how to pick a simplest camera-minimal problem for each minimal problem. This simplification results in 74575 equivalence classes. Only 76 of these were known; the rest are new. To identify problems having potential for practical solving of image matching and 3D reconstruction, we present several natural subfamilies of camera-minimal problems as well as compute solution counts for all camera-minimal problems which have less than 300 solutions for generic data.",

abstract="Many tasks in modern urban planning require 3-dimensional (3D) spatial information, preferably in the form of 3D city models. Constructing such models requires automatic methods for reliable 3D building reconstruction. House roofs encountered in residential areas in European cities exhibit a wide variety in their shapes. This limits the use of predefined roof models for their reconstruction. The strategy put forward in this paper is, first, to construct a polyhedral model of the roof structure, which captures the topology of the roof, but which might not be very accurate in a metric sense; and then, in a second step, to improve the metric accuracy by fitting this model to the data. This decoupling of topology extraction from metric reconstruction allows a more efficient roof modelling involving less criteria. And, restricting the processing, at all stages, to one or just a few roof structures, by using a colour-based segmentation of the images, allows to use constraints that are not very tight. The approach has been tested on a state-of-the-art dataset of aerial images of residential areas in Brussels.",

    "abstract": "We study non-archimedean $μ$-entropy for toric variety as a further exploration of $μ$K-stability. We show the existence of optimizer of toric non-archimedean $μ^λ$-entropy for $λ\\in \\mathbb{R}$ and the uniqueness for $λ\\le 0$. For the proof of existence, we establish a Rellich type compactness result for convex functions on simple polytope. We also reveal a thermodynamical structure on toric non-archimedean $μ$-entropy. This observation allows us to interpret the enigmatic parameter $T = - \\fracλ{2π}$ as temperature and non-archimedean $μ$-entropy as entropy of an infinite dimensional composite system.",

% In this section, we provide a formal definition of partial KB inference in biomedical entity linking and introduce the notations we used in this paper.

\paragraph{Entity Linking} Let $\mathcal{E}$ denote a target KB comprises of a set of biomedical concepts.
Given a text $\boldsymbol{s}$ with length $n$, an EL model aims to find the mentions $m$ and corresponding concepts $e\in \mathcal{E}$.
Concretely, the model can be regarded as a mapping $f:\boldsymbol{s}\to\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{E}$, where $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{E} = \{(i, j, e)|0\leq i\leq j\leq n, e\in\mathcal{E}\}$ denotes the possible target mention-concept pairs, and $i,j$ mark the start and end positions of the mention spans in $\boldsymbol{s}$.

% $f: \boldsymbol{s}\to\mathcal{P}$, where $\mathcal{P} = \{(i, j, e)|0\leq i\leq j\leq n, e\in\mathcal{E}\}$ denotes the power set of the possible target label.
% $x_i$ and $x_j$ are the start and end tokens of the mention in the text $\boldsymbol{s}$, and $e$ stands for the target concept from $\mathcal{E}$.
% The learn mapping $f$ can be viewed as a composition of NER ($i,j$) and NED ($e\in\mathcal{E}$).
% is expected to find the exact position $i,j$ of a biomedical entity mention (NER) and the concept $e\in\mathcal{E}$ referred to from the KB (NED).

\paragraph{Partial KB inference} In the conventional EL scenario, the target KB is the same in training and inference. 
In this paper, we consider a partial KB inference scenario containing two different KBs, $\mathcal{E}_1$ and $\mathcal{E}_2$, and assume $\mathcal{E}_1\supsetneq\mathcal{E}_2$.
The larger KB $\mathcal{E}_1$ corresponds to the training KB while the smaller KB $\mathcal{E}_2$ corresponds to the \textit{partial inference KB}.
Models are required to map a text $\boldsymbol{s}$ to a different label set $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{E}_2}$ during inference, rather than $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{E}_1}$ during training, and we have $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{E}_1}\supsetneq\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{E}_2}$. 
% Therefore, the gold label sets for training and inference are different, and the gold label set for inference is a subset of that for training. 
There exists a label distribution shift in this scenario.
We investigate whether current entity linking models are robust for partial KB inference and how models perform under the shifted distribution of targets. 
%As mentioned before, this is a practical scenario that the user only cares about the mentions and concepts referred to from a particular KB (e.g., SNOMED-CT) or a particular semantic type (e.g., diseases) while the methods only train on all mentions and concepts from a common super-set KB (e.g., UMLS). 

%An inverse setting of partial KB inference is that models are trained on $\mathcal{E}_2$ and evaluated on $\mathcal{E}_1$. 
%However, transferring from small KBs to large KBs is naturally a zero-shot problem, which is out of score for this research.
% In biomedical domain, the model may not acquire the special knowledge to link the concept entities out of small KBs, and the setting is out of scope for this research.

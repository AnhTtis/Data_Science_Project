    "abstract": "For a given Coleman family of modular forms, we construct a formal modeland prove the existence of a family of Galois representations associated to the Colemanfamily. As an application, we study the variations of Iwasawa $λ$- and $μ$-invariants of dualfine (strict) Selmer groups over the cyclotomic Zp-extension of Q in Coleman families ofmodular forms. This generalizes an earlier work of Jha and Sujatha for Hida families.",

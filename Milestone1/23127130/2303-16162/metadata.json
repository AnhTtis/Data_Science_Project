    "abstract": "We provide a pedagogical introduction to the theory of principal 2-bundles with adjusted connections and show how they enter the description of geometric and non-geometric T-dualities as proposed in arXiv:2204.01783. This description combines the torus fibrations as well as the gerbe containing the Kalb-Ramond $B$-field into a single geometric object, a particular case of a non-abelian gerbe. The $B$-field and the metric are encoded in the connection of this categorified principal bundle, and a T-duality is described as a particular span or correspondence of such bundles. The formalism is manifestly covariant under the full T-duality group, and it readily reproduces key examples from the literature.",

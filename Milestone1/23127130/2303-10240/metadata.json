    "abstract": "We consider the classical Steenrod problem on realization of integral homology classes by continuous images of smooth oriented manifolds. Let $k(n)$ be the smallest positive integer such that any integral $n$-dimensional homology class becomes realizable in the sense of Steenrod after multiplication by $k(n)$. The best known upper bound for $k(n)$ was obtained independently by G. Brumfiel and V. Buchstaber in 1969. All known lower bounds for $k(n)$ were very far from this upper bound. The main result of this paper is a new lower bound for $k(n)$ which is asymptotically equivalent to the Brumfiel-Buchstaber upper bound (in the logarithmic scale). For $n<24$ we prove that our lower bound is exact. Also we obtain analogous results for the case of realization of integral homology classes by continuous images of smooth stably complex manifolds.",

    "abstract": "In solids, chemical short-range order (CSRO) refers to the self-organisation of atoms of certain species occupying specific crystal sites. CSRO is increasingly being envisaged as a lever to tailor the mechanical and functional properties of materials. Yet quantitative relationships between properties and the morphology, number density, and atomic configurations of CSRO domains remain elusive. Herein, we showcase how machine learning-enhanced atom probe tomography (APT) can mine the near-atomically resolved APT data and jointly exploit the technique's high elemental sensitivity to provide a 3D quantitative analysis of CSRO in a CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy. We reveal multiple CSRO configurations, with their formation supported by state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo simulations. Quantitative analysis of these CSROs allows us to establish relationships between processing parameters and physical properties. The unambiguous characterization of CSRO will help refine strategies for designing advanced materials by manipulating atomic-scale architectures.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that non-diffusive, fluid-like heat transport, such as heat backflowing from cooler to warmer regions, can be induced, controlled, and amplified in extreme thermal conductors such as graphite and hexagonal boron nitride. We employ the viscous heat equations, i.e. the thermal counterpart of the Navier-Stokes equations in the laminar regime, to show with first-principles quantitative accuracy that a finite thermal viscosity yields steady-state heat vortices, and governs the magnitude of transient temperature waves. Finally, we devise strategies that exploit devices' boundaries and resonance to amplify and control heat hydrodynamics, paving the way for novel experiments and applications in next-generation electronic and phononic technologies.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we overview the Poisson gauge theory focusing on the most recent developments. We discuss the general construction and its symplectic-geometric interpretation. We consider explicit realisations of the formalism for all non-commutativities of the Lie algebraic type. We discuss Seiberg-Witten maps between Poisson gauge field-theoretical models.",

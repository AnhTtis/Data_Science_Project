\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We present AssetField, a novel framework that mines assets from neural fields. 
We adopt a ground feature plane representation to model scene density, color and semantic fields, on which
assets mining and grouping can be directly conducted. 
The novel occupancy-guided RGB-DINO feature plane enables cross-scene asset grouping and the construction of an expandable neural  asset library, enabling
a variety of intuitive scene editing at object-, category- and scene-level.
Extensive experiments are conducted to show the easy control over multiple scenes and the realistic rendering results given novel scene configurations.
However, AssetField still suffer from limitations like:
separating connected objects in the scene;
handling stacked/overlapped objects; and performing vertical translations.
Rendering quality might also be compromised due to complex scene background in real-world. 
More limitations are discussed in the supplementary.
We believe the proposed representation can be further explored for the manipulation and construction of large-scale scenes,~\eg, by following floorplans or via a programmable scheme like \emph{procedural modeling}.

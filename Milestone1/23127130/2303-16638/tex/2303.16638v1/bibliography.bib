abstract = "We discuss the geometry of the genus one fibrations associated to an elliptic fibration on a K3 surface. We show that the two-torsion subgroup of the Brauer group of a general elliptic fibration is naturally isomorphic to the two torsion of the Jacobian of a curve associated to the fibration. We remark that this is related to Recillas’ trigonal construction. Finally we discuss the two-torsion in the Brauer group of a general K3 surface with a polarization of degree two."

abstract = {Abstract We construct non-trivial L-equivalence between curves of genus one and degree five, and between elliptic surfaces of multisection index five. These results give the first examples of L-equivalence for curves (necessarily over non-algebraically closed fields) and provide a new bit of evidence for the conjectural relationship between L-equivalence and derived equivalence. The proof of the L-equivalence for curves is based on Kuznetsov's Homological Projective Duality for Gr(2,5), and L-equivalence is extended from genus one curves to elliptic surfaces using the Ogg–Shafarevich theory of twisting for elliptic surfaces. Finally, we apply our results to K3 surfaces and investigate when the two elliptic L-equivalent K3 surfaces we construct are isomorphic, using Neron–Severi lattices, moduli spaces of sheaves and derived equivalence. The most interesting case is that of elliptic K3 surfaces of polarization degree ten and multisection index five, where the resulting L-equivalence is new.},

 abstract = {We study the relationship between an elliptic fibration on an elliptic K3 surface and its Jacobian surface. We give an explicit description of the Picard lattice of the Jacobian surface. Then we use the description to prove that certain K3 surfaces do not admit a non-Jacobian fibration. Moreover, we obtain an inequality involving the determinant of the Picard lattice and the number of components of reducible fibres, which implies, among others, that if an elliptic K3 surface has Picard lattice with relatively small determinant, then every elliptic fibration on it must have a reducible fibre. Some examples of K3 surfaces are discussed.},

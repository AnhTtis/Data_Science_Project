    "abstract": "This paper is about the construction of a family of centrally synergistic potential functions from a single modified trace function on SO(3). First, we demonstrate that it is possible to complete the construction through angular warping with multiple directions, particularly effective in the unresolved cases in the literature. Second, it can be shown that for each potential function in the family, there exists a subset of the family such that the synergistic gap is positive at the unwanted critical points. This allows the switching condition to be checked within the selected subsets while implementing synergistic hybrid control. Furthermore, the positive lower bound of synergistic gap is explicitly expressed by selecting a traditional warping angle function. Finally, we apply the proposed synergistic potential functions to obtain robust global attitude tracking.",

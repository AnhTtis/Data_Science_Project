    "abstract": "Feshbach association of ultracold molecules using narrow resonances requires exquisite control of the applied magnetic field. Here we present a magnetic field control system to deliver magnetic fields of over 1000\\,G with ppm-level precision integrated into an ultracold-atom experimental setup. We combine a battery-powered current-stabilized power supply with active feedback stabilization of the magnetic field using fluxgate magnetic field sensors. As a real-world test we perform microwave spectroscopy of ultracold Rb atoms and demonstrate an upper limit on our magnetic field stability of 2.4(3)\\,mG at 1050~G [2.3(3)\\,ppm relative] as determined from the spectral feature.",

abstract = {Ultracold atomic gases have developed into prime systems for experimental studies of Efimov three-body physics and related few-body phenomena, which occur in the universal regime of resonant interactions. In the last few years, many important breakthroughs have been achieved, confirming basic predictions of universal few-body theory and deepening our understanding of such systems. We review the basic ideas along with the fast experimental developments of the field, focussing on ultracold cesium gases as a well-investigated model system. Triatomic Efimov resonances, atom-dimer Efimov resonances, and related four-body resonances are discussed as central observables. We also present some new observations of such resonances, supporting and complementing the set of available data.},

  abstract = {This thesis reports on an universal method for highly efﬁcient production of a low entropy
ensemble of heteronuclear molecules. The goal is to efﬁciently "quantum-engineer" a strongly
dipolar quantum gas in an optical lattice with unity ﬁlling. First, the simultaneous production
of two quantum degenerate samples of 87 Rb and 133 Cs is revisited in view of the subsequent
manipulation steps. Then we load the two spatially separated Bose- Einstein condensates of
Rb and Cs into an optical lattice and we create a Mott insulator of Cs with exactly one atom
per lattice site to suppress loss. The lattice depth is adjusted to simultaneously support a
superﬂuid of Rb which is of fundamental importance because in the next step we move Rb
towards the Cs Mott insulator with the movable Rb trap. A magnetic Feshbach resonance
is used to tune the interspecies interactions to zero and to merge both atomic samples. In
combination with the repulsive Rb-Rb interactions, Rb-Cs precursor pairs can form on each
individual lattice site. An adiabatic magnetic-ﬁeld ramp associates the paired atoms to RbCs
molecules. Coherent adiabatic transfer by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) can
be applied to subsequently transfer the weakly-bound molecules to the rovibronic ground
state. An electrical ﬁeld can be used to polarize the ensemble and to tune the long-range
dipole-dipole interactions This work succeeded in producing an outstanding ﬁlling fraction
of more than 30% of molecules in an optical lattice. This value can be pushed much higher
by several improvements, which will be discussed in this work.The method developed in this
thesis provides a system with tunable long-range interactions, perfectly suited for quantum-
simulation experiments, tests of fundamental constants and investigations of novel states of
matter.},

abstract = {We have calculated the time-dependent dynamics of two ultracold Na atoms in an atom trap where a time-dependent magnetic field B(t) moves a Feshbach resonance state across the energy threshold for a binary collision. Our coupled-channel scattering calculations, which reproduce the observed properties of such resonances in sodium atom collisions, can be reduced to an effective two-channel configuration-interaction model for one bound state and one continuum. The model is adapted to describe the time-dependent dynamics induced by B(t) for two atoms trapped either in a strongly confining single well of an optical lattice or in an optical potential in the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that a simple Landau-Zener curve crossing model gives quantitative agreement with exact calculations of field-induced transition rates. If B(t) sweeps the resonance across threshold from above, two atoms in the ground state of the trap potential can be efficiently converted to translationally cold dimer molecules. If the resonance is swept from below, the atoms can be removed from the ground state and placed in hot vibrational levels of the trap. Our calculations reproduce the rapid atom loss rates observed in a Na Bose-Einstein condensate due to sweeping a Feshbach resonance state through the binary collision threshold.},

abstract = {We consider in detail the situation of applying a time-dependent external magnetic field to a 87 Rb atomic Bose-Einstein condensate held in a harmonic trap, in order to adiabatically sweep the interatomic interactions across a Feshbach resonance to produce diatomic molecules. To this end, we introduce a minimal two-body Hamiltonian depending on just five measurable parameters of a Feshbach resonance, which accurately determines all low-energy binary scattering observables, in particular, the molecular conversion efficiency of just two atoms. Based on this description of the microscopic collision phenomena, we use the many-body theory of K{\"{o}}hler and Burnett (2002 Phys. Rev. A 65 033601) to study the efficiency of the association of molecules in a 87 Rb Bose-Einstein condensate during a linear passage of the magnetic-field strength across the 100 mT Feshbach resonance. We explore different, experimentally accessible, parameter regimes, and compare the predictions of Landau-Zener, configuration interaction, and two-level mean-field calculations with those of the microscopic many-body approach. Our comparative studies reveal a remarkable insensitivity of the molecular conversion efficiency with respect to both the details of the microscopic binary collision physics and the coherent nature of the Bose-Einstein condensed gas, provided that the magnetic-field strength is varied linearly. We provide the reasons for this universality of the molecular production achieved by linear ramps of the magnetic-field strength, and identify the Landau-Zener coefficient determined by Mies et al (2000 Phys. Rev. A 61 022721) as the main parameter that controls the efficiency.},

Long-lived condensates of up to 104 atoms have been produced by using a magnetic-field-induced Feshbach resonance to reverse the sign of the scattering length. This system provides new opportunities for the study of condensate physics. The variation of the scattering length near the resonance has been used to magnetically tune the condensate self-interaction energy over a wide range, extending from strong repulsive to large attractive interactions. When the interactions were switched from repulsive to attractive, the condensate shrank to below our resolution limit, and after ∼5 ms emitted a burst of high-energy atoms. {\textcopyright} 2000 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {When atoms in a gas are cooled to extremely low temperatures, they will—under the appropriate conditions—condense into a single quantum-mechanical state known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. In such systems, quantum-mechanical behaviour is evident on a macroscopic scale. Here we explore the dynamics of how a Bose–Einstein condensate collapses and subsequently explodes when the balance of forces governing its size and shape is suddenly altered. A condensate's equilibrium size and shape is strongly affected by the interatomic interactions. Our ability to induce a collapse by switching the interactions from repulsive to attractive by tuning an externally applied magnetic field yields detailed information on the violent collapse process. We observe anisotropic atom bursts that explode from the condensate, atoms leaving the condensate in undetected forms, spikes appearing in the condensate wavefunction and oscillating remnant condensates that survive the collapse. All these processes have curious dependences on time, on the strength of the interaction and on the number of condensate atoms. Although the system would seem to be simple and well characterized, our measurements reveal many phenomena that challenge theoretical models.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in states of matter with topological order. These are characterized by highly stable ground states robust to perturbations that preserve the topology, and which support excitations with so-called anyonic statistics. Topologically ordered states can arise in two-dimensional lattice-spin models, which were proposed as the basis for a new class of quantum computation. Here, we show that the relevant hamiltonians for such spin lattice models can be systematically engineered with polar molecules stored in optical lattices, where the spin is represented by a single-valence electron of a heteronuclear molecule. The combination of microwave excitation with dipole–dipole interactions and spin–rotation couplings enables building a complete toolbox for effective two-spin interactions with designable range, spatial anisotropy and coupling strengths significantly larger than relevant decoherence rates. Finally, we illustrate two models: one with an energy gap providing for error-resilient qubit encoding, and another leading to topologically protected quantum memory.},

The creation is done in the vicinity of a so far undetected Feshbach resonance at about 196 G which we identify in this work by atom-loss spectroscopy. We investigate the involved molecular state by performing destructive radio-frequency binding-energy measurements. For the constructive molecule creation we use radio-frequency pulses with which we assemble up to 6000 molecules. We analyze the molecule creation efficiency as a function of the radio-frequency pulse duration and the atom number ratio between Na23 and K39. We find an overall optimal efficiency of 6{\%} referring to the K39 atom number. The measured lifetime of the molecules in the bath of trapped atoms is about 0.3 ms.},

Our system consists of open-shell alkali-metal Li6 and closed-shell Yb173 atoms, both spin polarized and held at various temperatures between 1 and 20 $\mu$K. We confirm that Feshbach resonances in this system are solely the result of a weak separation-dependent hyperfine coupling between the electronic spin of Li6 and the nuclear spin of Yb173. Our analysis also shows that three-body recombination rates are controlled by the identical fermion nature of the mixture, even in the presence of s-wave collisions between the two species and with recombination rate coefficients outside the Wigner threshold regime at our lowest temperature. Specifically, a comparison of experimental and theoretical line shapes of the recombination process indicates that the characteristic asymmetric line shape as a function of applied magnetic field and a maximum recombination rate coefficient that is independent of temperature can only be explained by triatomic collisions with nonzero, p-wave total orbital angular momentum. The resonances can be used to form ultracold doublet ground-state molecules and to simulate quantum superfluidity in mass-imbalanced mixtures.},

A brief introduction into the theory of STIRAP and the early applications for population transfer within three-level systems is followed by the discussion of several extensions to multi-level systems, including multistate chains and tripod systems. The main emphasis is on the wide range of applications in atomic and molecular physics (including atom optics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, formation of ultracold molecules, precision experiments, etc.), quantum information (including single- and two-qubit gates, entangled-state preparation, etc.), solid-state physics (including processes in doped crystals, nitrogen-vacancy centers, superconducting circuits, etc.), and even some applications in classical physics (including waveguide optics, frequency conversion, polarization optics, etc.). Promising new prospects for STIRAP are also presented (including processes in optomechanics, detection of parity violation in molecules, spectroscopy of core-nonpenetrating Rydberg states, and population transfer with X-ray pulses).},

In order to suppress the decoherence effect, magnetic field noise needs to be properly measured and controlled. Magnetic field noise power spectrum measurement using a single trapped ion based quantum spectrum analyzer is a very effective way. In this paper, the magnetic field noise measurement based on dynamic decoupling technique is analyzed theoretically. Furthermore, we use magnetically insensitive transition to measure the magnetic field noise, which has the potential to measure stronger magnetic field noise and speed up the measurement process. In our experiment, we suppress the magnetic field noise by using active feedback control and passive compensation, where the required passive compensation amplitude is obtained by measuring the magnetic field noise spectrum of a single 25Mg+ ion. With the magnetic field noise suppressed, the expected contribution of the magnetic field noise to the stability of the 25Mg+-27Al+ ion optical clock can be decreased from 2.8×10-15/$\tau$ to 7.2×10-16/$\tau$ .},

We survey the Feshbach resonances in diatomic systems combining the nine stable alkali-metal isotopes with those of Yb, focusing on the illustrative examples of RbYb and CsYb. We show that the resonance widths may expressed as a product of physically comprehensible terms in the framework of Fermi's golden rule. The resonance widths depend strongly on the background scattering length, which may be adjusted by selecting the Yb isotope, and on the hyperfine coupling constant and the magnetic field.

abstract = {We investigate the possibility of forming Li þ Yb ultracold molecules by magnetoassociation in mixtures of ultracold atoms. We find that magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances exist, but are extremely narrow for even-mass ytterbium isotopes, which all have zero spin. For odd-mass Yb isotopes, however, there is a new mechanism due to hyperfine coupling between the electron spin and the Yb nuclear magnetic moment. This mechanism produces Feshbach resonances for fermionic Yb isotopes that can be more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than for the bosonic counterparts. It has recently become possible to convert gases of alkali-metal atoms coherently into molecules in their absolute ground state, by magnetoassociation followed by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). This has so far been achieved for KRb [1] and Cs 2 [2], but other species are under active investigation. Other methods for producing ultracold ground-state molecules are also under development [3-8]. Ultracold polar molecules have important potential applications in quantum computing and quantum simulation, and dipolar quantum gases promise a rich new physics with many novel properties [9]. Even more new properties would be accessible for ultra-cold molecules with both electric and magnetic dipole moments [10]. However, alkali-metal dimers have singlet ground states, which cannot be tuned magnetically except through the very small magnetic moments of the constituent nuclei. There is therefore great interest in producing ultracold polar molecules with doublet or triplet ground states. Among the most promising candidates for this are molecules formed from an alkali-metal atom and a 1 S atom such as an alkaline earth or Yb. A number of experimental groups are studying ultracold mixtures in which such molecules might be formed, including Rb þ Yb [11] and Li þ Yb [12-14]. It was originally believed that systems of this type would not have Feshbach resonances suitable for magnetoassoci-ation, because the bound-state channels (correlating with the upper hyperfine state of the alkali-metal atom) are uncoupled to the entrance channel by the conventional collision Hamiltonian. However, we have recently shown that a coupling does exist, due to the modification of the alkali-metal hyperfine coupling by the singlet atom at short range [15]. For the prototype system Rb þ Sr, we showed that, under favorable circumstances, this mechanism could produce magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances with widths up to 100 mG, which might be used for magnetoassociation. In the present Letter we consider the topical system Li þ Yb, which is under experimental investigation by at least two groups and has also been investigated using electronic structure calculations [16,17]. We show that the mechanism we previously proposed does produce Feshbach resonances in this system, but that for bosonic (spin-zero) isotopes of Yb they are extremely narrow. However, for fermionic isotopes of Yb there is a different mechanism that can produce resonances that are more than 2 orders of magnitude wider. Furthermore, the recent measurements of the scattering length for 6 Li-174 Yb [13,14] allow us to estimate the magnetic fields at which these Feshbach resonances will occur. The collision Hamiltonian for a pair of atoms a and b is @ 2 2 {\`{A}}R {\`{A}}1 d 2 dR 2 R þ {\^{}} L 2 R 2 þ {\^{}} H a þ {\^{}} H b þ {\^{}} VðRÞ; (1) where R is the internuclear distance, is the reduced mass, {\^{}} L 2 is the angular momentum operator for mechanical rotation of the atoms about one another, {\^{}} H a and {\^{}} H b are the Hamiltonians for the free atoms (in an applied field) and {\^{}} VðRÞ is the interaction operator. For collision of an alkali-metal atom a with a closed-shell (1 S) atom b, {\^{}} H a ¼ a {\^{}} i a {\'{A}} {\^{}} s þ ðg e a B {\^{}} s z þ g nuc a N {\^{}} i a;z ÞB; {\^{}} H b ¼ g nuc b N {\^{}} i b;z B; (2) where a is the hyperfine coupling constant for atom a, {\^{}} s, {\^{}} i a , and {\^{}} i b are the electron and nuclear spin operators, g e a , g nuc a , and g nuc b are the corresponding g factors, and B is the magnetic field, whose direction defines the z axis. There is only one electronic state, of symmetry 2 AE þ , arising from interaction of atoms in 2 S and 1 S states. As described in Ref. [15], the hyperfine coupling constant of the alkali metal is modified by the presence of the closed-shell atom, a ðRÞ ¼ a þ {\'{A}} a ðRÞ. However, if the closed-shell atom has nonzero nuclear spin i b , there may also be a coupling b ðRÞ ¼ {\'{A}} b ðRÞ between i b and the electron spin; this term has not been considered previously. The interaction operator is therefore {\^{}} VðRÞ ¼ VðRÞ þ {\'{A}} a ðRÞ {\^{}} i a {\'{A}} {\^{}} s þ {\'{A}} b ðRÞ {\^{}} i b {\'{A}} {\^{}} s: (3) PRL 108, 043201 (2012) P H Y S I C A L},

abstract = {Cooling molecules to ultralow temperatures is difficult owing to the fact they have many degrees of freedom. Now, a dense cloud of molecules in their lowest vibrational and rotational level has been prepared in an optical lattice, paving the way to Bose–Einstein condensation of ground-state molecules. Control over all internal and external degrees of freedom of molecules at the level of single quantum states will enable a series of fundamental studies in physics and chemistry1,2. In particular, samples of ground-state molecules at ultralow temperatures and high number densities will facilitate new quantum-gas studies3 and future applications in quantum information science4. However, high phase-space densities for molecular samples are not readily attainable because efficient cooling techniques such as laser cooling are lacking. Here we produce an ultracold and dense sample of molecules in a single hyperfine level of the rovibronic ground state with each molecule individually trapped in the motional ground state of an optical lattice well. Starting from a zero-temperature atomic Mott-insulator state5 with optimized double-site occupancy6, weakly bound dimer molecules are efficiently associated on a Feshbach resonance7 and subsequently transferred to the rovibronic ground state by a stimulated four-photon process with {\textgreater}50{\%} efficiency. The molecules are trapped in the lattice and have a lifetime of 8 s. Our results present a crucial step towards Bose–Einstein condensation of ground-state molecules and, when suitably generalized to polar heteronuclear molecules, the realization of dipolar quantum-gas phases in optical lattices8,9,10.},

@article{Regal2003,
abstract = {Following the realization of Bose–Einstein condensates in atomic gases, an experimental challenge is the production of molecular gases in the quantum regime. A promising approach is to create the molecular gas directly from an ultracold atomic gas; for example, bosonic atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate have been coupled to electronic ground-state molecules through photoassociation1 or a magnetic field Feshbach resonance2. The availability of atomic Fermi gases offers the prospect of coupling fermionic atoms to bosonic molecules, thus altering the quantum statistics of the system. Such a coupling would be closely related to the pairing mechanism in a fermionic superfluid, predicted to occur near a Feshbach resonance3,4. Here we report the creation and quantitative characterization of ultracold 40K2 molecules. Starting with a quantum degenerate Fermi gas of atoms at a temperature of less than 150 nK, we scan the system over a Feshbach resonance to create adiabatically more than 250,000 trapped molecules; these can be converted back to atoms by reversing the scan. The small binding energy of the molecules is controlled by detuning the magnetic field away from the Feshbach resonance, and can be varied over a wide range. We directly detect these weakly bound molecules through their radio-frequency photodissociation spectra; these probe the molecular wavefunction, and yield binding energies that are consistent with theory.},

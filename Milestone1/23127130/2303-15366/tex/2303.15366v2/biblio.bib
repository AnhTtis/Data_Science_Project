As a corollary, the forgetful map between the corresponding compactifications of \${\textbackslash}mathcal M\_\{1,3\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal M\_\{1,2\}\$ is a surjective holomorphic map between compact complex hyperbolic orbifolds of different dimensions higher than one, giving an answer to a problem raised by Siu. The proof consists in computing their Toledo invariants: we put this computation in a broader context, replacing the Fibonacci representations with any Hermitian modular functor and extending the Toledo invariant to a full series of cohomological invariants beginning with the signature \$p-q\$. We prove that these invariants satisfy the axioms of a Cohomological Field Theory and compute the \$R\$-matrix at first order (hence the usual Toledo invariants) in the case of the \${\textbackslash}rm\{SU\}\_2/{\textbackslash}rm\{SO\}\_3\$-quantum representations at any level.},

This book explains as many important theorems, examples, and techniques as possible, quickly and directly, while at the same time giving full details and keeping the text nearly self-contained. The book is suitable for graduate students. A Primer on Mapping Class Groups begins by explaining the main group-theoretical properties of Mod( S ), from finite generation by Dehn twists and low-dimensional homology to the Dehn-Nielsen-Baer theorem. Along the way, central objects and tools are introduced, such as the Birman exact sequence, the complex of curves, the braid group, the symplectic representation, and the Torelli group. The book then introduces Teichm{\"u}ller space and its geometry, and uses the action of Mod( S ) on it to prove the Nielsen-Thurston classification of surface homeomorphisms. Topics include the topology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, the connection with surface bundles, pseudo-Anosov theory, and Thurston's approach to the classification.},

We show that, in genus 2, the Fibonacci TQFT representation is actually a specialization of the Jones representation.

We give two descriptions of this subgroup. One is topological using surgery, the other is homological and builds on work of Turaev and work of Walker. Some applications to TQFT are discussed. They are based on the fact that our construction allows one to precisely describe how the phase factors that arise in the skein theory approach to TQFT-representations of the mapping class group depend on the choice of a lagrangian on the surface.},

  month = jun,
  publisher = {Springer Science \& Business Media},
  abstract = {The goal of this book is to present local class field theory from the cohomo logical point of view, following the method inaugurated by Hochschild and developed by Artin-Tate. This theory is about extensions-primarily abelian-of "local" (i.e., complete for a discrete valuation) fields with finite residue field. For example, such fields are obtained by completing an algebraic number field; that is one of the aspects of "localisation". The chapters are grouped in "parts". There are three preliminary parts: the first two on the general theory of local fields, the third on group coho mology. Local class field theory, strictly speaking, does not appear until the fourth part. Here is a more precise outline of the contents of these four parts: The first contains basic definitions and results on discrete valuation rings, Dedekind domains (which are their "globalisation") and the completion process. The prerequisite for this part is a knowledge of elementary notions of algebra and topology, which may be found for instance in Bourbaki. The second part is concerned with ramification phenomena (different, discriminant, ramification groups, Artin representation). Just as in the first part, no assumptions are made here about the residue fields. It is in this setting that the "norm" map is studied; I have expressed the results in terms of "additive polynomials" and of "multiplicative polynomials", since using the language of algebraic geometry would have led me too far astray.},

  abstract = {Due to the strong appeal and wide use of this monograph, it is now available in its third revised edition. The monograph gives a systematic treatment of 3-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) based on the work of the author with N. Reshetikhin and O. Viro. This subject was inspired by the discovery of the Jones polynomial of knots and the Witten-Chern-Simons field theory. On the algebraic side, the study of 3-dimensional TQFTs has been influenced by the theory of braided categories and the theory of quantum groups. The book is divided into three parts. Part I presents a construction of 3-dimensional TQFTs and 2-dimensional modular functors from so-called modular categories. This gives a vast class of knot invariants and 3-manifold invariants as well as a class of linear representations of the mapping class groups of surfaces. In Part II the technique of 6j-symbols is used to define state sum invariants of 3-manifolds. Their relation to the TQFTs constructed in Part I is established via the theory of shadows. Part III provides constructions of modular categories, based on quantum groups and skein modules of tangles in the 3-space. This fundamental contribution to topological quantum field theory is accessible to graduate students in mathematics and physics with knowledge of basic algebra and topology. It is an indispensable source for everyone who wishes to enter the forefront of this fascinating area at the borderline of mathematics and physics. Contents: Invariants of graphs in Euclidean 3-space and of closed 3-manifolds Foundations of topological quantum field theory Three-dimensional topological quantum field theory Two-dimensional modular functors 6j-symbols Simplicial state sums on 3-manifolds Shadows of manifolds and state sums on shadows Constructions of modular categories},

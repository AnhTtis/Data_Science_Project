    "abstract": "We prove that level $5$ Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ quantum representations, also known as the Fibonacci representations, of mapping class groups are locally rigid. More generally, for any prime level $\\ell$, we prove that the level $\\ell$ $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ quantum representations are locally rigid on all surfaces of genus $g\\geq 3$ if and only if they are locally rigid on surfaces of genus $3$ with at most $3$ boundary components. This reduces local rigidity in prime level $\\ell$ to a finite number of cases.",

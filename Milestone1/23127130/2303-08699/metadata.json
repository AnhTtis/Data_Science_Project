    "abstract": "We study here a hitherto unexplored line of research, namely an investigation which reveals hidden nonlocality in a linear network with independent sources. In the usual paradigm of Bell nonlocality, there are certain states which exhibit nonlocality only after the application of suitable local filtering operations, which in turn are some special stochastic local operations assisted with classical communication (SLOCC). In the present work, we introduce the notion of hidden non n-locality. The notion is detailed using a bilocal network. We provide instances of hidden non bilocality and non trilocality, where we notice quite intriguingly that non bilocality is observed even when one of the sources distributes a mixed two-qubit separable state. Furthermore a characterization of hidden non bilocality is also provided in terms of the Bloch-Fano decomposition, wherein we conjecture that to witness hidden non bilocality, one of the two states (used by the sources) must have non-null Bloch vectors",

    \caption{\small Illustration of feature space with three optimization objectives (ERM/ERM+SupCon/SA-FAS). For each objective, the first row shows the feasible solution in toy examples where each domain with a live/spoof label is represented by one circle/cross. The second role shows the visualization of real data via linear projection. The visualization is conducted by inserting and scattering the features from a 2-dimensional hidden layer between the penultimate layer and the final output layer. }%

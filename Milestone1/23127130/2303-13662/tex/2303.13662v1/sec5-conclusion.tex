\Section{Conclusion}

This paper provides a new learning framework \methodname that learns domain-variant features but domain-invariant decision boundaries for cross-domain FAS. Our framework is naturally motivated, which facilitates invariant decision boundaries and learning distinguishable representations. We provide important theoretical insights that IRM objectives can be equivalently optimized by the PG with an alternative objective. Experiments show that \methodname can notably improve performance compared to the current best methods, establishing state-of-the-art. We also discuss the limitation of our work in Appendix~\ref{sec:limit}. 
We hope this paper will inspire more future works in incorporating domain-specific signals in FAS feature representation, and also extending this idea to broader domain generalization tasks.

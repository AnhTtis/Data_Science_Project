    "abstract": "While advances in electronic band theory have brought to light new topological systems, understanding the interplay of band topology and electronic interactions remains a frontier question. In this work, we predict new interacting electronic orders emerging near higher-order Van Hove singularities present in the Chern bands of the Haldane model. We classify the nature of such singularities and employ unbiased renormalization group methods that unveil a complex landscape of electronic orders, which include ferromagnetism, density-waves and superconductivity. Importantly, we show that repulsive interactions can stabilize long-sought pair-density wave state and an exotic Chern supermetal, which is a new class of non-Fermi liquid with anomalous quantum Hall response. This framework opens a new path to explore unconventional electronic phases in two-dimensional chiral bands through the interplay of band topology and higher-order Van Hove singularities.",

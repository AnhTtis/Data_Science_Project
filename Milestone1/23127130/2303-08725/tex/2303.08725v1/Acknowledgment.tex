Gonzalo Navarro from asked us personally if
this result could be extended, establishing necessary and sufficient
conditions for a matrix $\gamma$ to induce $\distanciaA{\gamma}$-quasimetric on sequences.
Since quasimetric functions have the same axioms of metric
functions, except that symmetry is not required, the question could be answer
quickly if $\gamma$ induces $\distanciaA{\gamma}\text{-P}$
for each axiom of reflexivity, non-negativity, positivity, and triangle inequality.

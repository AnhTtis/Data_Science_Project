\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we established necessary and sufficient conditions for
scoring matrices to induce each one of the properties of a metric in
weighted edit distances. For a subset of scoring matrices that induce
normalized edit distances, we also characterized the generalized metric spaces 
premetric, semimetric, hemimetric, pseudometric, quasimetric, and metric.
Moreover, we defined an
extended alignment distance, which takes into account a set of edit
operations that transforms one sequence into another, regardless the
existence of a corresponding standard alignment to represent it, describing a
criterion to find a sequence of edit operations whose weight is 
minimum. Similarly to the weighted edit distance, we determined the 
class of scoring matrices that induce extended alignment distances for 
each of the properties of a metric.

\EA{Será necessário? We intent to translate these results into practical algorithms for
sequence comparison and alignments in the generalized metric spaces we
have studied. Subsequently, we want to perform experiments and to
compare the results to those obtained using customary metrics.}

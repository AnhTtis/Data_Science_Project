  abstract="{This `Encyclopedia of distances' is a rich source of material on
    definitions in connection with the notion ``distance'' in different areas of
    mathematics and applied sciences. This includes distances in (convex)
    geometry, probability, statistics, coding/graph theory, data analysis,
    pattern recognition, computer networks, computer graphics, astronomy,
    astrology, biology, physics, chemistry and also in areas like economy,
    philosophy and medicine.
 
 The book is not just a collection of
    definitions, but in most cases it includes an introduction into the
    corresponding theory. The book allows to refresh one's own knowledge and
    also to learn about new notions of distances in the domains listed above.
 
    In this way, the book serves not only as a reference book but also as an
    introduction of distances in several other scientific fields. Altogether,
    the book is recommended not only for students in the undergraduate and
    graduate level, but also for scientists in mathematics and other related
    fields.
 
  A CD-Rom is included.}",

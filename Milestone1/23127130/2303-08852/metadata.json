    "abstract": "We argue that for any single-trace operator in ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM theory there is a large twist double-scaling limit in which the Feynman graphs have an iterative structure. Such structure can be recast using a graph-building operator. Generically, this operator mixes between single-trace operators with different scaling limits. The mixing captures both the finite coupling spectrum and corrections away from the large twist limit. We first consider a class of short operators with gluons and fermions for which such mixing problems do not arise, and derive their finite coupling spectra. We then focus on a class of long operators with gluons that do mix. We invert their graph-building operator and prove its integrability. The picture that emerges from this work opens the door to a systematic expansion of ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM theory around the large twist limit.",

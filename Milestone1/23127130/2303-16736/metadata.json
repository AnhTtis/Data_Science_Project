    "abstract": "In this paper we study the approximate controllability of fractional partial differential equations associated with the so-called Hilfer type time fractional derivative and a non-negative selfadjoint operator $A$ with a compact resolvent on $L^2(Ω)$, where $Ω\\subset\\RR^N$ ($N\\geq 1$) is an open set. More precisely, we show that if $0\\leν\\le 1$, $1<μ\\le 2$ and $Ω\\subset\\RR^N$ is an open set, then the system \\begin{equation*} \\begin{cases} \\D^{μ,ν}_tu+Au=fχ_ω\\;\\;&\\mbox{ in }\\;Ω\\times(0,T),\\\\ (I_t^{(1-ν)(2-μ)}u)(\\cdot,0)=u_0 &\\mbox{ in }\\;Ω,\\\\ (\\partial_tI_t^{(1-ν)(2-μ)}u)(\\cdot,0)=u_1 &\\mbox{ in }\\;Ω, \\end{cases} \\end{equation*} is memory approximately controllable for any $T>0$, $u_0\\in D(A^{1/μ})$, $u_1\\in L^2(Ω)$ and any non-empty open set $ω\\subsetΩ$. The same result holds for every $u_0\\in D(A^{1/2})$ and $u_1\\in L^2(Ω)$.",

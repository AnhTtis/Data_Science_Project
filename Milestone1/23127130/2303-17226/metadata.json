    "abstract": "Each quiver corresponds to a path semigroup, and such a path semigroup also corresponds to an associative K-algebra over an algebraically closed field K. Let Q be a quiver and S, KQ be its path semigroup, path algebra, respectively. In this paper, we studied some properties of the congruence lattice of S. First, we showed that there is a one-to-one correspondence between congruences on S and certain algebraic ideals of KQ. Based on such a description, we considered acyclic quivers and showed that the congruence latices of such path semigroups are strong upper semimodular but not necessarily lower semimodular. Moreover, we provided some equivalent conditions for the congruence lattices to be modular and distributive.",

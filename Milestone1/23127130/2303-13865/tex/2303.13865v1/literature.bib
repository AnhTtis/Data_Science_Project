We show that when the signal is dual to a process that has two components, one deterministic and one a pure death process, and with respect to functions that define changes of measure conjugate to the emission density, the filtering distributions evolve in the family of finite mixtures of such measures and the filter can be computed at a cost that is polynomial in the number of observations. Special cases of our framework include the Kalman filter, and computable filters for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process and the one-dimensional Wright-Fisher process, which have been investigated before. The dual we obtain for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process appears to be new in the literature.},

One can define a category based on {M}arkov kernels which has many of the formal properties of the ordinary category of relations. In the present paper we will examine the categorical properties of {M}arkov kernels and stress the analogies and differences with the category of relations. We will show that this category has partially-additive structure and, as such, supports basic constructs like iteration. This allows one to give a probabilistic semantics for a language with while loops in the manner of Kozen. The category in question was originally defined by Giry following suggestions of Lawvere."

Nevertheless, the exposition is sufficiently detailed to make it clear what is presently known, and to serve as a starting place for more in-depth study.

 abstract = {We consider inference for the reaction rates in discretely observed networks such as those found in models for systems biology, population ecology, and epidemics. Most such networks are neither slow enough nor small enough for inference via the true state-dependent {M}arkov jump process to be feasible. Typically, inference is conducted by approximating the dynamics through an ordinary differential equation (ODE) or a stochastic differential equation (SDE). The former ignores the stochasticity in the true model and can lead to inaccurate inferences. The latter is more accurate but is harder to implement as the transition density of the SDE model is generally unknown. The linear noise approximation (LNA) arises from a first-order Taylor expansion of the approximating SDE about a deterministic solution and can be viewed as a compromise between the ODE and SDE models. It is a stochastic model, but discrete time transition probabilities for the LNA are available through the solution of a series of ordinary differential equations. We describe how a restarting LNA can be efficiently used to perform inference for a general class of reaction networks; evaluate the accuracy of such an approach; and show how and when this approach is either statistically or computationally more efficient than ODE or SDE methods. We apply the LNA to analyze Google Flu Trends data from the North and South Islands of New Zealand, and are able to obtain more accurate short-term forecasts of new flu cases than another recently proposed method, although at a greater computational cost.},

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.} }

@book{Bishop07,
  abstract = {This is the first textbook on pattern recognition to present the {B}ayesian viewpoint. The book presents approximate inference algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where exact answers are not feasible. It uses graphical models to describe probability distributions when no other books apply graphical models to machine learning. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.},

Our approach simultaneously generates the whole of the state vector given the mixture and coefficient indicator variables and simultaneously generates all the indicator variables conditional on the state vectors. The states are generated efficiently using the Kalman filter. We illustrate our approach by several examples and empirically compare its performance to another Gibbs sampler where the states are generated one at a time. The empirical results suggest that our approach is both practical to implement and dominates the Gibbs sampler that generates the states one at a time.}",

We outline the construction of reverse chains in several situations and apply this to processes which are connected with jumpâdiffusion models and finite state {M}arkov chains. By combining forward and reverse representations we then construct transition density estimators for chains which have root-N accuracy in any dimension and consider some applications."

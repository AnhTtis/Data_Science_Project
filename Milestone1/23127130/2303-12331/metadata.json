    "abstract": "Let $X$ be a finite set in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$. If the squared distance between any two distinct points in $X$ is an odd integer, then the cardinality of $X$ is bounded above by $d+2$, as shown by Rosenfeld (1997) or Smith (1995). They proved that there exists a $(d+2)$-point set $X$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ having only odd integral squared distances if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$. The distances can be interpreted as an element of the finite field $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. We generalize this result for a local ring $(A_\\mathfrak{p},\\mathfrak{p}A_\\mathfrak{p})$ as follows. Let $K$ be an algebraic number field that can be embedded into $\\mathbb{R}$. Fix an embedding of $K$ into $\\mathbb{R}$, and $K$ is interpreted as a subfield of $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $A=O_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$, and $\\mathfrak{p}$ a prime ideal of $O_K$. Let $(A_\\mathfrak{p},\\mathfrak{p}A_\\mathfrak{p})$ be the local ring obtained from the localization $(A\\setminus \\mathfrak{p})^{-1} A$, which is interpreted as a subring of $\\mathbb{R}$. If the squared distances of $X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ are in $A_\\mathfrak{p}$ and each squared distance is congruent to some constant $k \\not\\equiv 0 $ modulo $\\mathfrak{p} A_\\mathfrak{p}$, then $|X| \\leq d+2$, as shown by Nozaki (2023). In this paper, we prove that there exists a set $X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ attaining the upper bound $|X| \\leq d+2$ if and only if $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $4$ when the finite field $A_\\mathfrak{p}/ \\mathfrak{p} A_\\mathfrak{p}$ is of characteristic 2, and $d+2$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$ when $A_\\mathfrak{p}/ \\mathfrak{p} A_\\mathfrak{p}$ is of characteristic $p$ odd. We also provide examples attaining this upper bound.",

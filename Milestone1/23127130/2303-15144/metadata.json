    "abstract": "We propose a novel respiratory motion-resolved MR image reconstruction method that jointly treats multi-echo k-space raw data. Continuously acquired non-Cartesian multi-echo/multi-coil k-space data with free breathing are sorted/binned into the motion states from end-expiratory to end-inspiratory phases based on a respiratory motion signal. Temporal total variation applied to the motion state dimension of each echo is then coupled in the $\\ell_2$ sense for joint reconstruction of the multiple echoes. Reconstructed source images of the proposed method are compared with conventional echo-by-echo motion-resolved reconstruction, and R2* of the proposed and echo-by-echo methods are compared with respect to a clinical reference. We demonstrate that inconsistency between echoes is successfully suppressed in the proposed joint reconstruction method, producing high-quality source images and R2* measurements compared to clinical reference.",

        \textbf{Class} & \textbf{Description} \\
     
    \hline
        System & Systems that rely on both Semantic Web resources and Machine Learning components (SWeMLS). \\
        Pattern & A standardized representation of the processing flows and the roles of the SW and ML components in a SWeML system.\\
        Processor & A notion to represent the algorithmic module. It uses one or more Instances as input, applies one or more Models, and outputs one or more Instances. \\
        % A Processor may use other procedures, such as data pre-processing.\\
            % \hline
            
    \hline
        Task & The task that a SWeML system seeks to address.\\
        Domain & The application domain of a SWeML system. \\
        Area & The application area of a SWeML system. \\
    
    \hline
        Model & A set of assumptions, data, and inferences used to represent an entity or state mathematically.\\
        \hspace{7pt} StatisticalModel & A mathematical relationship between one or more random variables and other non-random variables. \\   
        \hspace{7pt} SymbolicModel & It shows the connections between different "concepts" (entities). The meaning that underlies information is formally represented by semantic technologies.\\
        
    \hline
        Instance & An example or single occurrence of something.\\
        \hspace{7pt} Data & Facts and statistics collected together and used as a basis for reasoning, discussion or calculation.\\
        \hspace{7pt} Symbol & A representation of symbolic data such as semantic entities or relations.\\
    
    \hline
        System Maturity & The classification of a SWeML system's maturity level.\\
        Documentation & Documentation properties about infrastructure, provenance, evaluation and other properties of a SWeML system. \\
        Paper & Papers in which such SWeML systems are reported. It contains information about author's country, keywords, title and other information of a paper.\\

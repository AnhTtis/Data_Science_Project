    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate how two factors, metacognitive skills and motivation, would impact student learning across domains. More specifically, our primary goal is to identify the critical, yet robust, interaction patterns of these two factors that would contribute to students' performance in learning logic first and then their performance on a subsequent new domain, probability. We are concerned with two types of metacognitive skills: strategy-awareness and time-awareness, that is, which problem-solving strategy to use and when to use it. Our data were collected from 495 participants across three consecutive semesters, and our results show that the only students who consistently outperform their peers across both domains are those who are not only highly motivated but also strategy-aware and time-aware.",

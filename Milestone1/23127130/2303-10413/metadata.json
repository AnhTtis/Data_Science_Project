    "abstract": "We introduce the association-dissociation model of neutral hydrogen molecule, which is a finite-dimensional cavity quantum electrodynamics model of chemistry with two two-level artificial atoms on quantum dots placed in optical cavities, based on the Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard model. The motion of the nuclei can be represented in quantum form. Electron spin transition and spin-spin interaction between electron and nucleus are both considered. Consideration is also given to the effects of nuclear and electron spins on the formation of neutral hydrogen molecule.",

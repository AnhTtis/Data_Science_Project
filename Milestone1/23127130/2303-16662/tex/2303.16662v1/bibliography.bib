   abstract = {Three-dimensional real-life simulations are generally unsteady and involve moving geometries. Industries are currently still very far from performing such simulations on a daily basis, mainly due to the robustness of the moving mesh algorithm and their extensive computational cost. The proposed approach is a way to improve these two issues. This paper brings two new ideas. First, it demonstrates numerically that moving three-dimensional complex geometries with large displacements is feasible using only vertex displacements and mesh-connectivity changes. This is new and presents several advantages over usual techniques for which the number of vertices varies in time. Second, most of the CPU time spent to move the mesh is due to the resolution of the mesh deformation algorithm to propagate the body displacement inside the volume. Thanks to the use of advanced meshing operators to optimize the mesh, we can reduce drastically the number of such resolutions thus impacting favorably the CPU time. The efficiency of this new methodology is illustrated on numerous 3D problems involving large displacements.},

The advantage over standard finite element discretizations is that rotating components may be introduced into a stationary flow domain without geometric incompatibility. Although geometric compatibility is exactly achieved, the discretization of the flow velocity and pressure remains incompatible at the interface between the stationary and rotating subdomains. This incompatibility is handled by using a weak enforcement of the continuity of solution fields at the interface of the stationary and rotating subdomains.},

	Abstract = {Anisotropic mesh adaptation is important for accurately simulating physical phenomena at reasonable computational costs. Previous work in anisotropic mesh adaptation has been restricted to studies in two- or three-dimensional computational domains. However, in order to accurately simulate time-dependent physical phenomena in three dimensions, a four-dimensional mesh adaptation tool is needed. This work develops a four-dimensional anisotropic mesh adaptation tool to support time-dependent three-dimensional numerical simulations. Anisotropy is achieved through the use of a background metric field and the mesh is adapted using a dimension-independent cavity framework. Metric-conformity -- in the sense of edge lengths, element quality and element counts -- is effectively demonstrated on four-dimensional benchmark cases within a unit tesseract in which the background metric is prescribed analytically. Next, the metric field is optimized to minimize the approximation error of a scalar function with discontinuous Galerkin discretizations on four-dimensional domains. We demonstrate that this four-dimensional mesh adaptation algorithm achieves optimal element sizes and orientations. To our knowledge, this is the first presentation of anisotropic four-dimensional meshes.},

Various constitutive models were examined to model the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood and their model constants were summarized. A method to incorporate the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood was introduced so that the viscosity could be calculated locally. The pressure drop, wall shear stress and velocity profiles for the case of blood viscosity were compared for the case of Newtonian viscosity (0.0345 poise). The effect of the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood on the overall pressure drop across the arterial casting was found to be significant at a flow of the Reynolds number of 100 or less. Also in the region of flow separation or recirculation, the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood yields larger wall shear stress than the Newtonian case. The origin of the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood was discussed in relation to the viscoelasticity and yield stress of blood.},

The simultaneous discretization of space and time with simplex elements extends the flexibility of unstructured meshes from space to time. In this work, we adapt a finite element formulation for compressible flows to simplex space-time meshes. The method obtained allows, for example, flow simulation on spatial domains that change topology with time. We demonstrate this with the two-dimensional simulation of compressible flow in a valve that fully closes and opens again. Furthermore, simplex space-time meshes facilitate local temporal refinement. A three-dimensional transient simulation of blow-by past piston rings is run in parallel on 120 cores. The timings point out savings of computation time gained from local temporal refinement in four-dimensional space-time meshes.},

abstract = {Abstract Considering the flow through biological or engineered valves as an example, there is a variety of applications in which the topology of a fluid domain changes over time. This topology change is characteristic for the physical behavior, but poses a particular challenge in computer simulations. A way to overcome this challenge is to consider the application-specific space-time geometry as a contiguous computational domain. In this work, we obtain a boundary-conforming discretization of the space-time domain with four-dimensional simplex elements (pentatopes). To facilitate the construction of pentatope meshes for complex geometries, the widely used elastic mesh update method is extended to four-dimensional meshes. In the resulting workflow, the topology change is elegantly included in the pentatope mesh and does not require any additional treatment during the simulation. The potential of simplex space-time meshes for domains with time-variant topology is demonstrated in a valve simulation, and a flow simulation inspired by a clamped artery.},

The need for an adequate mesh-update strategy is underlined, and various automatic mesh-displacement prescription algorithms are reviewed. This includes mesh-regularization methods essentially based on geometrical concepts, as well as mesh-adaptation techniques aimed at optimizing the computational mesh according to some error indicator. Emphasis is then placed on particular issues related to the modeling of compressible and incompressible flow and nonlinear solid mechanics problems.

First, we propose a constrained Galerkin formulation that corrects the standard Galerkin statement by incorporating prior information about the long-time attractor. For explicit and semi-implicit time discretizations, our statement reads as a constrained quadratic programming problem where the objective function is the Euclidean norm of the error in the reduced Galerkin (algebraic) formulation, while the constraints correspond to bounds for the maximum and minimum value of the coefficients of the N-term expansion. Second, we propose an a posteriori error indicator, which corresponds to the dual norm of the residual associated with the time-averaged momentum equation. We demonstrate that the error indicator is highly-correlated with the error in mean flow prediction, and can be efficiently computed through an offline/online strategy. Third, we propose a Greedy algorithm for the construction of an approximation space/procedure valid over a range of parameters; the Greedy is informed by the a posteriori error indicator developed in this paper. We illustrate our approach and we demonstrate its effectiveness by studying the dependence of a two-dimensional turbulent lid-driven cavity flow on the Reynolds number.},

   abstract = {The solution of nonlinear structural problems by means of a space–time model order reduction approach is investigated. The main target is the prediction of the long-term response while reducing both the computation time and the storage requirements considerably. A nonstandard discretization approach is used which treats the internal degrees of freedom as additional unknowns. The resulting nonlinear problem is formulated in a variational setting. The proposed reduced basis represents the behavior of the structure in a complete time interval, e.g. during one load cycle (for cyclic processes). The reduced variables are obtained by a projection of the time-local stationary conditions onto appropriate test functions defined in space–time. This leads to a low-dimensional nonlinear system of equations. Details regarding the theoretical derivation, the discretization and the numerical treatment of the nonlinearity are presented. In the numerical examples the reduced model is compared to FEM reference solutions. Different choices for the test functions are discussed and the postprocessing abilities offered by the reduced model are illustrated.},

This method, which we call the surface-reconstruction virtual-region mesh update method, integrates the virtual region approach and a surface reconstruction process to handle complex boundary movements. The virtual region approach allows having an activated and deactivated part of the mesh, where elements can freely enter or leave the activated domain. Furthermore, the surface reconstruction ensures boundary conformity of the activated domain. The robustness of the proposed method is shown in two numerical examples: a variation of the benchmark Poiseuille flow, and the flow simulation during a closing diaphragm valve. In particular, the diaphragm valve simulation includes large boundary movement, complex geometry, and closing motion. For this case, both steady and transient simulation results at different closing conditions are presented.}

The essential new ingredient is the presence of time in the formulation and solution of the problem - we shall "simply" treat time as an additional, albeit special, parameter. First, we introduce the reduced-basis recipe - Galerkin projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter-time space - and develop a new greedy adaptive procedure to "optimally" construct the parameter-time sample set. Second, we propose error estimation and adjoint procedures that provide rigorous and sharp bounds for the error in specific outputs of interest: the estimates serve a priori to construct our samples, and a posteriori to confirm fidelity. Third, based on the assumption of affine parameter dependence, we develop offline-online computational procedures: in the offline stage, we generate the reduced-basis space; in the online stage, given a new parameter value, we calculate the reduced-basis output and associated error bound. The operation count for the online stage depends only on N (typically small) and the parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for repeated, rapid, reliable evaluation of input-output relationships in the many-query or real-time contexts. © EDP Sciences, SMAI 2005.},

The new theoretic contributions are the formulation of a reduced basis approximation scheme for these general evolution problems and the derivation of rigorous a-posteriori error estimates in various norms. Algorithmically, an offline/online decomposition of the scheme and the error estimators is realized in case of affine parameter-dependence of the problem. This is the basis for a rapid online computation in case of multiple simulation requests.

The goal of the current study is the extension to time-dependent problems, which are typically approximated using the POD—Greedy algorithm (Haasdonk and Ohlberger 2008). In this algorithm, each greedy step is invoking a temporal compression step by performing a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD).

   abstract = {For most finite element simulations, boundary-conforming meshes have significant advantages in terms of accuracy or efficiency. This is particularly true for complex domains. However, with increased complexity of the domain, generating a boundary-conforming mesh becomes more difficult and time consuming. One might therefore decide to resort to an approach where individual boundary-conforming meshes are pieced together in a modular fashion to form a larger domain. This article presents a stabilized finite element formulation for fluid and temperature equations on sliding meshes. It couples the solution fields of multiple subdomains whose boundaries slide along each other on common interfaces. Thus, the method allows to use highly tuned boundary-conforming meshes for each subdomain that are only coupled at the overlapping boundary interfaces. In contrast to standard overlapping or fictitious domain methods the coupling is broken down to few interfaces with reduced geometric dimension. The formulation consists of the following key ingredients: the coupling of the solution fields on the overlapping surfaces is imposed weakly using a stabilized version of Nitsche's method. It ensures mass and energy conservation at the common interfaces. Additionally, we allow to impose weak Dirichlet boundary conditions at the nonoverlapping parts of the interfaces. We present a detailed numerical study for the resulting stabilized formulation. It shows optimal convergence behavior of the interface coupling for both Newtonian and generalized Newtonian material models. Simulations of flow of plastic melt inside single-screw as well as twin-screw extruders demonstrate the applicability of the method to complex and relevant industrial applications.},

Spline-based descriptions of arbitrary screw geometries are generated using Elliptic Grid Generation. They are evaluated in a number of discrete points to yield a coarse classical mesh. The use of a special control mapping allows to fine-tune properties of the coarse mesh like orthogonality at the boundaries. The coarse mesh is used as a ‘scaffolding’ to generate a boundary-conforming mesh out of a fine background mesh at run-time. Storing only a coarse mesh makes the method cheap in terms of memory storage. Additionally, the adaptation at run-time is extremely cheap compared to computing the flow solution. Furthermore, this method circumvents the need for expensive re-meshing and projections of solutions making it efficient and accurate. It is incorporated into a space–time finite element framework. We present time-dependent test cases of non-Newtonian fluids in 2D and 3D for complex screw designs.

In lieu of approximating the solution of interest using global (with respect to the time domain) empirical eigenfunctions, low-dimensional models are derived by constructing appropriate temporally-local eigenfunctions. Within this context, first of all, the time domain is partitioned into multiple clusters (i.e., subdomains) by using the framework known as global optimum search. This approach, a variant of Generalized Benders Decomposition, formulates clustering as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming problem and involves the iterative solution of a Linear Programming problem (primal problem) and a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming problem (master problem). Following the cluster generation, local (with respect to time) eigenfunctions are constructed by applying the proper orthogonal decomposition method to the snapshots contained within each cluster. Then, the Galerkin's projection method is employed to derive low-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems for each cluster. The local ODE systems are subsequently used to compute approximate solutions to the original PDE system. The proposed local model order-reduction technique is applied to a hydraulic fracturing process described by a nonlinear parabolic PDE system with the time-dependent spatial domain. It is shown to be more accurate and computationally efficient in approximating the original nonlinear system with fewer eigenfunctions, compared to the model order-reduction technique with temporally-global eigenfunctions. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 3818–3831, 2017.},

   abstract = {Abstract We devise new numerical algorithms, called PSC algorithms, for following fronts propagating with curvature-dependent speed. The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front also can be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

   abstract = {We present a projection-based model reduction formulation for parametrized time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach builds on the following ingredients: reduced bases (RB), which provide rapidly convergent approximations of the parameter-temporal solution manifold; reduced quadrature (RQ) rules, which provide hyperreduction of the nonlinear residual; and the dual-weighted residual (DWR) method, which provides an error representation formula for the quantity of interest. To find the RQ rules, we develop an empirical quadrature procedure (EQP) for time-dependent problems; we analyze the output error due to hyperreduction using a space–time DWR framework and identify appropriate constraints so that the output error due to hyperreduction is controlled. We in addition equip our reduced model with an online-efficient DWR a posteriori error estimate for the output; we again analyze the error in the hyperreduced dual problem and DWR expression to find appropriate constraints for the EQP so that the error in the error estimate is controlled. In the offline stage, the RBs and RQs, as well as the finite element mesh, are simultaneously constructed using a POD-greedy algorithm that leverages the online-efficient output error estimate. We demonstrate the framework for parametrized unsteady flows in a lid-driven cavity and over a NACA0012 airfoil. Reduced models achieve over two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, number of quadrature points, and wall-clock computational time, while achieving less than 0.5\% output error and providing efficient error estimates in predictive settings.},

   abstract = {In this work we deal with parametrized time dependent optimal control problems governed by partial differential equations. We aim at extending the standard saddle point framework of steady constraints to time dependent cases. We provide an analysis of the well-posedness of this formulation both for parametrized scalar parabolic constraint and Stokes governing equations and we propose reduced order methods as an effective strategy to solve them. Indeed, on one hand, parametrized time dependent optimal control is a very powerful mathematical model which is able to describe several physical phenomena, on the other, it requires a huge computational effort. Reduced order methods are a suitable approach to have rapid and accurate simulations. We rely on POD–Galerkin reduction over the physical and geometrical parameters of the optimality system in a space-time formulation. Our theoretical results and our methodology are tested on two examples: a boundary time dependent optimal control for a Graetz flow and a distributed optimal control governed by time dependent Stokes equations. With these two test cases the convenience of the reduced order modelling is further extended to the field of time dependent optimal control.},

   abstract = {In the present paper we propose reduced order methods as a reliable strategy to efficiently solve parametrized optimal control problems governed by shallow waters equations in a solution tracking setting. The physical parametrized model we deal with is nonlinear and time dependent: this leads to very time consuming simulations which can be unbearable, e.g., in a marine environmental monitoring plan application. Our aim is to show how reduced order modelling could help in studying different configurations and phenomena in a fast way. After building the optimality system, we rely on a POD-Galerkin reduction in order to solve the optimal control problem in a low dimensional reduced space. The presented theoretical framework is actually suited to general nonlinear time dependent optimal control problems. The proposed methodology is finally tested with a numerical experiment: the reduced optimal control problem governed by shallow waters equations reproduces the desired velocity and height profiles faster than the standard model, still remaining accurate.},

   abstract = {We discuss the stabilized finite element computation of unsteady incompressible flows, with emphasis on the space-time formulations, iterative solution techniques and implementations on the massively parallel architectures such as the Connection Machines. The stabilization technique employed in this paper is the Galerkin/least-squares (GLS) method. The Deformable-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized-Space-Time (DSD/SST) formulation was developed for computation of unsteady viscous incompressible flows which involve moving boundaries and interfaces. In this approach, the stabilized finite element formulations of the governing equations are written over the space-time domain of the problem, and therefore the deformation of the spatial domain with respect to time is taken into account automatically. This approach gives us the capability to solve a large class of problems with free surfaces, moving interfaces, and fluid-structure and fluid-particle interactions. In the DSD/SST approach the frequency of remeshing is minimized to minimize the projection errors involved in remeshing and also to increase the parallelization potential of the computations. We present a new mesh moving scheme that minimizes the need for remeshing; in this scheme the motion of the mesh is governed by the modified equations of linear homogeneous elasticity. The implicit equation systems arising from the finite element discretizations are solved iteratively by using the GMRES search technique with the clustered element-by-element, diagonal and nodal-block-diagonal preconditioners. Formulations with diagonal and nodal-block-diagonal preconditioners have been implemented on the Connection Machines CM-200 and CM-5. We also describe a new mixed preconditioning method we developed recently, and discuss the extension of this method to totally unstructured meshes. This mixed preconditioning method is similar, in philosophy, to multi-grid methods, but does not need any intermediate grid levels, and therefore is applicable to unstructured meshes and is simple to implement. The application problems considered include various free-surface flows and simple fluid-structure interaction problems such as vortex-induced oscillations of a cylinder and flow past a pitching airfoil.

In the deforming-spatial-domain/space-time (DSD/ST) procedure the variational formulation of a problem is written over its space-time domain, and therefore the deformation of the spatial domain with respect to time is taken into account automatically. Because the space-time mesh is generated over the space-time domain of the problem, within each time step, the boundary (or interface) nodes move with the boundary (or interface). Whether the motion of the boundary is specified or not, the strategy is nearly the same. If the motion of the boundary is unknown, then the boundary nodes move as defined by the other unknowns at the boundary (such as the velocity or the displacement). At the end of each time step a new spatial mesh covers the new spatial domain. For computational feasibility, the finite element interpolation functions are chosen to be discontinuous in time, and the fully discretized equations are solved one space-time slab at a time.}

These strategies are based on the deforming spatial-domain/spacetime (DSD/ST) procedure. In the DSD/ST approach, the stabilized variational formulations for these types of flow problem are written over their space-time domains. One of the important features of the approach is that it enables one to circumvent the difficulty involved in remeshing every time step and thus reduces the projection errors introduced by such frequent remeshings. Computations are performed for various test problems mainly for the purpose of demonstrating the computational capability developed for this class of problems. In some of the test cases, such as the liquid drop problem, surface tension is taken into account. For flows involving drifting cylinders, the mesh moving and remeshing schemes proposed are convenient and reduce the frequency of remeshing.}

The discretization is based on a nodal formulation, with appropriate numerical fluxes for the first and the second-order terms, respectively. The scheme is implicit, and we solve the resulting non-linear systems using a parallel Newton--Krylov solver. The meshes are produced by a mesh moving technique with element connectivity updates, and the corresponding space--time elements are produced directly based on these local opera- tions. To obtain globally conforming tetrahedral meshes, we first derive the required conditions on a prism boundary mesh to allow for a valid local triangulation. Next, we present an efficient algorithm for finding a global mesh that satisfies these conditions. We also show how to add and remove mesh nodes, again using local constructs for the space--time mesh. Our method is demonstrated on a number of test problems, showing the high-order accuracy for model problems, and the ability to solve flow problems on domains with complex large deformations.},

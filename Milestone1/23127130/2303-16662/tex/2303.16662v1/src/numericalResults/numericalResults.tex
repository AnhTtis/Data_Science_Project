In the following, we will illustrate how the proposed \gls{rom} approach, which makes use of a time-continuous space-time setting, can help to significantly decrease the required computational resources for time-dependent parametric problems defined in deforming domains. To that end, we present error and performance analysis results for two test cases. The test cases are representative of applications that may arise from engineering or biomedical problems, for example. The first test case involves a two-dimensional valve-like geometry, resulting in a 3D space-time geometry. In space, the valve plug moves over time and even closes off parts of the geometry, which means that the spatial topology changes. In the second test case, we consider a three-dimensional artery-like geometry. Consequently, the resulting space-time domain is 4D. In the center region, the geometry is compressed over time, which yields a deforming domain problem.

To lay the foundation for the subsequent \gls{mor} approach, we begin by deriving the \textit{parametric formulation} of transient flow problems defined in deforming domains. As mentioned before, parametric problems, e.g., may occur in the context of \gls{uq} or automatic control. Specifically, we consider problems that can be parametric in the \textit{material properties} involved or in their \textit{boundary conditions}. The variations in the material illustrate potential uncertainties in the process under investigation, which may be analyzed using \gls{uq}. Apart from that, adjustable boundary conditions prescribing, e.g., the inflow velocity, showcase the type of use in a context such as automatic control. 
As mentioned earlier, we focus on unsteady processes that take place in time-varying domains, which potentially undergo topology changes, too.

\bigskip\par
For the description of the time-dependent solution field in a deforming domain, it is convenient to treat space and time coordinates, which are denoted by $\x$ and $t$, in the same way. To that end, the \textit{time-continuous space-time domain} $\domainSpaceTime$ is introduced, which results from the time-dependent spatial domain $\domainSpace(t)$ and the time interval $[0,T]$:
\begin{align}
\domainSpaceTime = \domainSpace(t) \times [0,T],    
\end{align}
such that $(\x,t) \in \domainSpaceTime$. The respective space-time boundary is denoted as $\boundarySpaceTime$ where portions on which conditions of Dirichlet or Neumann type are prescribed are referred to as $\boundarySpaceTimeDirichlet$ and $\boundarySpaceTimeNeumann$, respectively.  Furthermore, initial conditions can be imposed over $\domainSpace(t=0)=\domainSpace(t_0)$. A sketch can be found in \Cref{fig:cst}. In contrast, in a \textit{time-discontinuous space-time} approach, one considers so-called time slabs $\domainSpaceTime_m$ with boundaries $\boundarySpaceTime_m$(see \Cref{fig:dst}). This results in a kind of time-stepping scheme with a modified computational domain in each time step. In that sense, the time-discontinuous approach is comparable to a semi-discrete description. A systematic comparison of time-continuous and time-discontinuous space-time formulations for advection-diffusion problems can be found in ~\cite{Danwitz2022}. However, as we would like to stress again, the time-continuous description is essential to directly apply established \gls{mor} techniques for deforming domain problems later.

To be able to eventually demonstrate the presented approach, we consider a specific example of fluid flow equations here. In particular, we make use of the \textit{Stokes equations}, which can be used to model a variety of fluid flow of low Reynolds number, for example.
Based on the conservation of mass and momentum, the Stokes equations provide statements for the, in this case parametric, \textit{velocity} and \textit{pressure} fields of the fluid, which are referred to as $\vel(\x,t;\paramVec)$ and $\p(\x,t;\paramVec)$, respectively. Here, $\paramVec$ denotes the \textit{parameter vector} collecting parameter values to vary either material properties or boundary conditions.
Note that we will drop the arguments of $\vel$ and $\p$ for the sake of notation in the following. Nevertheless, dependencies on $\paramVec$ will be stressed if necessary.
\par
The resulting \gls{bvp} in the space-time setting reads as follows:
\begin{align}
        \dv{\vel(\paramVec)} &= 0 &&\text{ in } \domainSpaceTime,
        \\
        \density \lp \dd{\vel(\paramVec)}{t} - \bdf \rp - \dv{\cstressParam{\vel}{\p}} &= \vek{0} &&\text{ in } \domainSpaceTime,
        \\
        \vel(\paramVec) &= \velDirichlet(\paramVec) &&\text{ on } \boundarySpaceTimeDirichlet,
        \\
        \cstressParam{\vel}{\p}\cdot \vek{n} &= \tractionNeumann(\paramVec) &&\text{ on } \boundarySpaceTimeNeumann,
        \\
        \vel(\x,0;\paramVec) &= \vel_0(\paramVec) &&\text{ in } \domainSpace(t_0).
\end{align}
Here, $\density$ is the fluid \textit{density}, $\bdf$ is a \textit{body force}, while $\velDirichlet(\paramVec)$, $\vel_0(\paramVec)$, and $\tractionNeumann(\paramVec)$ are the parameter-dependent prescribed velocity values and a \textit{traction vector}, respectively. 
Moreover, we consider parametric material properties through the fluid \textit{viscosity} $\visc(\paramVec)$ that is included in the \textit{Cauchy stress tensor} given by
\begin{align}
    \cstressParam{\vel}{\p} = - \p\lp\paramVec\rp \mat{I} + 2 \visc\lp\paramVec\rp \ros{\vel\lp\paramVec\rp},
\end{align}
where
$
    \ros{\vel} = \frac{1}{2} ( \vek{\nabla} \vel + \vek{\nabla} \vel^T )
$
is the \textit{rate-of-strain tensor}.
In the following, we will consider fluid materials whose viscous properties cannot be appropriately described by a Newtonian model. Examples for such non-Newtonian fluids are plastics melt or blood. 
To account for shear-thinning effects of the fluid, we use the Carreau-Yasuda model \cite{Carreau1972, Yasuda1981, Bird1987} for the viscosity, which depends on the shear rate 
\begin{align}
\shearrate(\vel; \paramVec) = \sqrt{2 \ros{\vel(\paramVec)} : \ros{\vel(\paramVec)}}.   
\end{align}
To stress the dependency on the velocity field, we from now on write $\visc(\vel; \paramVec)$ given by
\begin{align}
       % \visc(\vel; \paramVec) &= \frac{A}{\left(1+B\shearrate\right)^{C}},
        %\\
        \visc(\vel; \paramVec)
        &= 
        \visc_{\infty} 
        + \left( \visc_0 - \visc_{\infty} \right) \left[ 1 + \left( \lambda \shearrate \right)^a \right]^{\frac{n-1}{a}},
    \label{eq:viscosityModel}
\end{align}
with zero-shear-rate viscosity $\visc_0$, infinite-shear-rate viscosity $\visc_{\infty}$, characteristic time $\lambda$, power-law index $n$, and a dimensionless parameter $a$ describing the transition region between the zero-shear-rate viscosity and the power-law regions.
In addition to the indirect parameter dependency of the viscosity through the parametric velocity field, we also take into account potential fluctuations in the model parameters. This is motivated by the fact that these model parameters can only be determined through a regression-based approach using measurement data associated with uncertainties. 
\bigskip\par
Since the \gls{fem} will be used later to construct the \gls{fom} in \Cref{sec:fullOrderModel}, which in turn will serve as the basis for the \gls{rom} presented in \Cref{sec:reducedOrderModel}, it is worthwhile to state the \textit{weak formulation} of the problem here. We will assume that appropriate trial and weighting spaces for the velocity and the pressure field in the space-time domain $\domainSpaceTime$ are given. For the velocity, the trial and weighting spaces are denoted as $\trialSpaceVelocity(\domainSpaceTime)$ and $\weightingSpaceVelocity(\domainSpaceTime)$, respectively. For the pressure, the trial space is also the weighting space and they are referred to as $\trialSpacePressure(\domainSpaceTime)$. The resulting weak formulation of the parametric problem defined in the space-time domain $\domainSpaceTime$ reads:
\bigskip\par\noindent
\textit{Find }$\lp \trialVelocityParam, \trialPressureParam \rp 
\in 
\trialSpaceVelocity\lp\domainSpaceTime\rp 
\times 
\trialSpacePressure\lp\domainSpaceTime\rp $\textit{, such that }$\forall \lp \weightVelocity, \weightPressure \rp 
\in 
\weightingSpaceVelocity\lp\domainSpaceTime\rp 
\times 
\weightingSpacePressure\lp\domainSpaceTime\rp $\textit{:}
\begin{align}

    {
        \weightVelocity \cdot \density 
        \lp
            \dd{\trialVelocityParam}{t} - \bdf
        \rp
    }
    -
    \intDomainSpaceTime
    {
        \trialPressureParam \lp \dv{\weightVelocity}\rp
    }
    \nonumber
    \\
    +
    &
    \intDomainSpaceTime
    {
        \ros{\weightVelocity} : 2 \visc\lp\vel,\paramVec\rp \ros{\trialVelocity}
    }
    +
    \intDomainSpaceTime
    {
        \weightPressure \lp \dv{\trialVelocityParam}\rp
    }
    =
    \intBoundarySpaceTimeNeumann
    {
        \weightVelocity \cdot \tractionNeumann\lp\paramVec\rp
    }
    .

To simplify notation, the following short forms will be used in the remainder of this work:
\begin{align*}
    \begin{aligned}[t]
        \ddt{\trialVelocity}\lp\paramVec\rp 
        &= 
        \dd{\trialVelocityParam}{t},
        \\
        \bilinearFormPressureParam{\trialVelocity}{\weightPressure}{\paramVec}_{\domainSpaceTime}  
        &=     
        \intDomainSpaceTime
        {

        },
        \\

        &=
        \intDomainSpaceTime
        {
           \density \weightVelocity \cdot \bdf
        },
    \end{aligned}
    \qquad
    \begin{aligned}[t]
        \lp \weightVelocity, \ddt{\trialVelocity}; \paramVec \rp_{\domainSpaceTime} 
        &= 
        \intDomainSpaceTime
        {
           \density \weightVelocity \cdot \ddt{\trialVelocity}\lp\paramVec\rp

        \bilinearFormViscousStressParam{\weightVelocity}{\trialVelocity}{\trialVelocityHom}{\paramVec}_{\domainSpaceTime}  
        &=     
        \intDomainSpaceTime
        {
            \ros{\weightVelocity} : 2 \visc\lp \trialVelocityHom,\paramVec\rp \ros{\trialVelocity}
        },
        \\
        \lp \weightVelocity, \tractionNeumann; \paramVec \rp_{\boundarySpaceTimeNeumann}
        &=     
        \intBoundarySpaceTimeNeumann
        {
            \weightVelocity \cdot \tractionNeumann\lp\paramVec\rp
        }
        .
    \end{aligned}
\end{align*}
In this notation, \Cref{eq:navierStokesWeakExtended} can be stated as

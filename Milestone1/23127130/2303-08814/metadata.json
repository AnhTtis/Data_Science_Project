    "abstract": "We studied the two-loop non-factorizable Feynman diagrams for the $t$-channel single-top production process in quantum chromodynamics. We present a systematic computation of master integrals of the two-loop Feynman diagrams with one internal massive propagator in which a complete uniform transcendental basis can be built. The master integrals are derived by means of canonical differential equations and uniform transcendental integrals. The results are expressed in the form of Goncharov polylogarithm functions, whose variables are the scalar products of external momenta, as well as the masses of the top quark and the $W$ boson. We also gave a discussion on the diagrams with potential elliptic sectors.",

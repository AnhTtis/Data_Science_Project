  \caption{An overview of the proposed FreestyleNet. By applying Rectified Cross-Attention (RCA) in the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, Stable Diffusion~\cite{rombach2022high}, our method allows for freestyle layout-to-image synthesis, where a layout can be translated into realistic and creative images with a wide range of semantics specified by the input texts. 
  Note that the base text shown here is simply derived from the semantic layout in order to train our network on image-layout pairs. During inference, we can freely edit the text to generate diverse images.
  Here the text encoder and the diffusion model are adopted from Stable Diffusion and we omit the autoencoder of Stable Diffusion for simplicity.

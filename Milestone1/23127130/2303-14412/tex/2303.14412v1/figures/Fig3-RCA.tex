   \caption{An illustration of Rectified Cross-Attention (RCA). It utilizes the layout to rectify the attention score maps calculated between the text and image tokens. By forcing each text token to affect only pixels in the region specified by the layout, the spatial alignment between the generated image and the given layout is guaranteed.
   $Q$, $K$, $V$ are image queries, text keys, and text values, which are computed through projection layers respectively.

    "abstract": "Through modeling the universe as a symplectic 3-brane embedded in the bulk of N = 2 five-dimensional ungauged supergravity theory, the entire evolution of the universe can be interpreted from inflation to late-time acceleration without introducing an inflaton nor a cosmological constant. The time dependence of the brane is strongly correlated to the complex structure moduli of the underlying Calabi-Yau sub manifold and the bulk effects. The solutions to the field equations are found by exploiting the theory's symplectic structure where the time evolution is similar to our universe according to the latest data of the Planck mission. Our results present a new explanation for the nature of dark energy mainly based on the topology of the subspace and the existence of a fifth extra dimension.",

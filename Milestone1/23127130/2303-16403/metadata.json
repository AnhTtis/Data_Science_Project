    "abstract": "The computational investigation of Fermi, Pasta, Ulam, and Tsingou of arrays of nonlinearly coupled oscillators has led to a wealth of studies in nonlinear dynamics. Most of these studies have considered arrays of homogeneous oscillators, even though there are inherent heterogeneities between the oscillators in real-world arrays. Well-known FPUT phenomena, such as energy recurrence, can break down in such heterogeneous systems. In this paper, we present an approach to recover recurrence in FPUT systems in the presence of oscillator heterogeneities. We examine oscillator variabilities in FPUT systems with cubic nonlinearities, and we demonstrate that centrosymmetry in oscillator arrays may be an important source of recurrence.",

    "abstract": "The increasing growth of applications' memory capacity and performance demands has led the CPU vendors to deploy heterogeneous memory systems either within a single system or via disaggregation. For instance, systems like Intel's Knights Landing and Sapphire Rapids can be configured to use high bandwidth memory as a cache to main memory. While there is significant research investigating the designs of DRAM caches, there has been little research investigating DRAM caches from a full system point of view, because there is not a suitable model available to the community to accurately study largescale systems with DRAM caches at a cycle-level. In this work we describe a new cycle-level DRAM cache model in the gem5 simulator which can be used for heterogeneous and disaggregated systems. We believe this model enables the community to perform a design space exploration for future generation of memory systems supporting DRAM caches.",

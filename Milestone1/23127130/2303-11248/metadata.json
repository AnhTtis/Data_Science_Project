    "abstract": "We study Clark measures associated with general two-variable rational inner functions (RIFs) on the bidisk, including those with singularities, and with general $d$-variable rational inner functions with no singularities. We give precise descriptions of support sets and weights for such Clark measures in terms of level sets and partial derivatives of the associated RIF. In two variables, we characterize when the associated Clark embeddings are unitary, and for generic parameter values, we relate vanishing of two-variable weights with the contact order of the associated RIF at a singularity.",

    "abstract": "It has long been assumed that there is an intrinsic conflict between optical vortices and partial coherence, in that deterministic phase vortices do not appear in partially coherent fields. We demonstrate, however, that it is possible to construct a beam that has no deterministic vortices in the source plane yet evolves a deterministic vortex at a specified propagation distance.",

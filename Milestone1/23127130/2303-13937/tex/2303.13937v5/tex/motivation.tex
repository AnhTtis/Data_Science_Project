
In the case of top quark pair production, with each top quark decaying hadronically $t\rightarrow Wb \rightarrow qq^{\prime}b$, each quark is expected to initiate a shower in the detector which is reconstructed as a jet, resulting in six jets. The number of combinations to match the reconstructed jets to quarks from the top quark pair system is computationally intractable and grows exponentially with additional jets reconstructed in the final state, even when taking underlying symmetries into account.
Solving the combinatorics of this system is a key challenge in the measurement of the top quark and $t\bar{t}$ pair, and one which is often computationally limited.
The combinatorics can be restricted by looking at event topologies where the high momentum of the top quarks results in all three quarks being reconstructed in a single large radius jet, however this restricts the phase space to such topologies which represent only a small fraction of all events.

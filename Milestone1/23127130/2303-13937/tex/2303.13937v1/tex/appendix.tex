\subsection{Example Topograph}

A complete Topograph network is shown in \cref{fig:topottW:embed} for reconstruction of $t\bar{t}W$ in events containing exactly one lepton, one neutrino and multiple jets.
For the production of a top quark pair in association with a $W$ boson ($t\bar{t}W$), two top quark blocks and one $W$ block are connected to the input particles, but not to one another. The Topograph network is trained to identify the edges of the true daughter particles of each particle in the process, and predicts the kinematics of the two top quarks and the three $W$ bosons.
As Topographs are defined to represent an underlying physics process, it is also a choice whether to predefine whether the lepton and neutrino originate from a $W$ boson coming from a top decay, or the additional $W$ boson.
Here we see two options, one where the lepton is required to come from a top decay, and in the second case where no assumption is made.
% Topographs can be used to test both hypotheses simultaneously, or be used without predefined edges to predict the likeliest assignment itself.

\subsection{Comparisons with partial event trainings}
\label{app:partialspa}

Instead of training using only complete events, both the Topograph and \spanet models can be trained including partial events, that is, events where some partons are not able to be matched to reconstructed jets.
In the training events, for Topographs at least one $W$ boson, and for \spanet at least one top quark are required to be fully reconstructable.
For these models the efficiencies of fully reconstructable events change slightly, with Topographs having a slight reduction in efficiencies and \spanet a slight increase.
However, for most selections, the efficiencies are still within the uncertainties of models trained only on fully reconstructable events.
\Cref{tab:app_efficiencies_partial} shows the parton matching efficiencies for events categorised based on how many partons can be matched to reconstructed jets.
Here the benefit of training on partial events can be seen, with both Topographs and \spanet having higher efficiencies of correctly matching jets to the all available partons.

% On complete events, Topographs still have a higher overall reconstruction efficiency.

\subsection{Studying edge scores}

\label{app:studies}

\cref{fig:app_scores_wplus} shows the distribution of edge scores of the jets to the $W$ helper node which is decided to be the $W^+$ based on the loss.
\cref{fig:app_scores_wplus:all} includes all jets in the event.
The distribution for the jets which originate from the $W^+$ peak at one, whereas the distributions of all other jet types peak at zero.
A small peak at one can be seen for the $b$-jets originating from the top quark.
To investigate this peak, the scores of the $b$-jets from both the top and the anti-top quark are shown in \cref{fig:app_scores_wplus:btag}.
They are further split based on their $b$-tagging score.
The small peak at one originates from $b$-jets from the top quark which are not $b$-tagged.
Furthermore, the impact of the $b$-tagging on the score can be seen.
The $b$-jets from the anti-top quark which are not $b$-tagged have on average higher scores than the $b$-jets from the top quark which are $b$-tagged.
This could point to the $b$-tagging result being more important for the association to the $W$ nodes than kinematics.

\cref{fig:app_scores_top} shows the same distributions but to the top helper node which is decided to be the top quark.
Again, good separation of the true edges from the false edges can be seen.
Considering only $b$-jets and splitting them based on their $b$-tagging score, it can be seen, that the $b$-tagged jets originating from the anti-top quark have on average lower scores than the non $b$-tagged jets originating from the top quark.
So, the $b$-tagging decision is not as important for the association to the top helper nodes.

This reliance on the $b$-tagging result is not unexpected.
With a $b$-tagging efficiency of $70\%$, around $30\%$ of the $b$-jets will not be tagged as a $b$-jet, leaving a large contribution of true edges to the top helper nodes which are not $b$-tagged.
The observed mis-tag efficiency is around $5\%$. 
Therefore, only a small fraction of the true edges to the $W$ helper nodes is $b$-tagged.

\cref{fig:app_scores_wminus,fig:app_scores_antitop} show the same plots for the $W^-$ and anti-top. 
No qualitative differences can be observed to the plots for the $W^+$ and the top.

\subsection{Additional figures}
\label{app:plots}

\Cref{fig:app_regression_w,fig:app_regression_top} show the regression results for the $\eta$ and $\phi$ coordinate. 
The difference between the value of the predicted $\eta$ or $\phi$ and the true parton property is shown.
For the predicted properties, the parton is either reconstructed from the jets that the model associates to the parton or the regression result is taken.
`Correct' and `incorrect' events are shown in separate distributions. 
For `incorrect' events an additional prediction is shown by taking the true jets to reconstruct the parton properties.
For `correct' events, the regression has for both quantities a wider distribution than the model association. 
For `incorrect' events, the regression and the model association perform worse, however using the true jets also has a worse resolution for these events.
Especially for the $W$ boson, the regression and the model association have a worse performance.
However, for the top quark `incorrect' labelled events can still contain the correct three jets but with a wrong assignment by switching one of the $W$-jets with the $b$-jet.

    Each histogram is normalised to an area of one.
    The solid lines show the distributions for the Topograph, the dashed lines show the distributions for the \spanet, and the dashed-dotted lines show the distributions for the $\chi^2$ method.
    The different colours show the different types of events based on the assignment of the model: correct, incorrect, impossible.}

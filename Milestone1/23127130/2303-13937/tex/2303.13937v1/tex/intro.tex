
At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, beams of protons are collided together at incredibly high energies to probe the underlying nature of the universe.
From the objects recorded by the detectors on the LHC, the underlying physics processes in the collisions are attempted to be reconstructed.
% The particles produced in collisions can only be inferred by matching reconstructed objects to a hypothesised process. %In precision measurements, and particularly in the search for new physics, many processes have complex final states comprising many objects.

% One of the most prospective areas for new physics, and a cornerstone of the LHC search programme, are processes involving third generation fermions,
% top quarks, $b$-quarks, and tau leptons. %, the heaviest of the matter particles.
% Many new particles are predicted to decay into top and $b$-quarks, and result in final states with many particles whose origins are unknown. %The top quark itself has a three body decay.

In processes with a high multiplicity of objects, 
% As such processes result in a high multiplicity of objects, whose origins are not known,
reconstructing intermediate particles, such as the two top quarks and $W$ bosons in top quark pair production, is a crucial and challenging component in analyses~\cite
{TOPQ-2012-08, CMS-TOP-14-022, ATLAS:2015pfy,  TOPQ-2015-03, TOPQ-2016-01,  CMS:2016oae, CMS-TOP-17-008, CMS:2018htd,  CMS:2018quc, ATLAS:2018fwq, ATLAS:2019guf, ATLAS:2019hxz, CMS:2021vhb, ATLAS:2022waa, TOPQ-2015-01, CMS:2015cal, TOPQ-2018-18}.
This is of particular interest when measuring the mass of an intermediary particle, or its kinematic properties as part of a cross section measurement.

% In the case of top quark pair production, with each top quark decaying hadronically $t\rightarrow Wb \rightarrow qqb$, each quark is expected to initiate a shower in the detector which is reconstructed as a jet, resulting in six jets. The number of combinations to match the reconstructed jets to quarks from the top quark pair system is computationally intractable and grows exponentially with additional jets reconstructed in the final state, even when taking underlying symmetries into account.
% Solving the combinatorics of this system is a key challenge and one which is often computationally limited.
% The combinatorics can be restricted by looking at event topologies where the high momentum of the top quarks results in al three quarks being reconstructed in a single large radius jet, however this restricts the phase space to such topologies which represent only a small fraction of all events.

In this work we introduce Topographs, a new machine learning approach for reconstructing the full hypothesised decay chain from observed objects. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning~(ML) with underlying priors from particle physics, through the nature of particle decays, to reconstruct underlying physics processes including the intermediary particles.
% This is in stark contrast to other techniques which apply ML algorithms optimised outside of physics or attempt brute force approaches.
The computational complexity of Topographs scales linearly with object multiplicity, whereas alternative methods scale quadratically~\cite{Shlomi_2021,fenton2021permutationless} or exponentially~\cite{Erdmann_2014,HIGG-2017-03}.
% By using Topographs the computational barriers of high multiplicity challenges are broken, and better performance can be achieved.
% For example, for top quark pair production there are $4N+2$ edges in a Topograph compared to the $N^2$ in Ref.~\cite{Shlomi_2021}, where $N $ge 6)$ is the number of reconstructed jets per event.
% In approaches using attention mechanisms~\cite{fenton2021permutationless,shmakov2021spanet} no graph structure is used and only the permutation invariant collection of objects are considered.

% An additional advantage of the Topograph method is that not only are the topology and combinatorics of a process reconstructed, but the kinematics and properties of intermediary particles are predicted. This introduces greater flexibility and precision in analyses and could be used to test the likelihood of a hypothesised process similar to the matrix element method~(MEM)~\cite{Fiedler_2010}. 
% Topographs capture the benefits of distinct approaches used to solve combinatorics and predict the kinematics of intermediate particles into a single method without the computational limitations.

We apply Topographs to reconstruct the underlying processes in the production of top quarks pairs in the all hadronic decay channel.
However, the architecture can be applied to any particle physics process and is not limited to event level reconstruction.

\section{Numerical results for $T_i(\mathbf{q})$}

In the main article the behaviour for the quantity $T_i(\mathbf{q})$ is
discussed for values $\mathbf{q} \to 0$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:plotT}  we show
numerical results for the UEG obtained with rCCD and CCD. One can see that
mininum value of $T_i(\mathbf{q})$ converges slowly to the theoretical expected
limit of -0.5. For rCCD results with larger electron numbers are presented
below.

  \caption{The minimum value for a given momentum transfer $\mathbf{q}$ is shown for the quantity $T_i(\mathbf{q})$.
           Results are shown for rCCD and CCD. Both simulations employed 730 electrons and a
           density of $r_s = 20$.}
  \label{fig:plotT}
\end{figure*}


\section{Structure factor for different values of $r_s$}

The discussion in the main article was based on a structure factor obtained for a density of
$r_s = 20$. Fig.~\ref{fig:rs} shows structure factors for different values of
$r_s$. This illustrates that the discussed behaviour of the structure factor not only holds
for $r_s = 20$, but is also true for the important range of values between 1 and 5.
However, for larger values of $r_s$ the minimum of the structure factor is already observable
for smaller electron numbers. This was the reason for choosing a rather high value of $r_s$ in
the main article. In both calculations, roughly 18 virtual spatial orbitals per occupied spatial
orbital are used.

  \caption{For two different number of electrons $N$, twist-averaged structure factors for rCCD are shown.
(a) shows results for $r_s = 3$, (b) shows results for $r_s = 20$.}
  \label{fig:rs}
\end{figure*}


\section{rCCD results for larger electron numbers}

%For rCCD we study systems with more than 246 electrons.  Results
%are presented for the largest electron numbers, which led to stable
%calculations using our implementation.

Figure~\ref{fig:2469occ} shows rCCD results using $N=4938$ electrons together
with data for $N=246$ electrons.  Similar to the numerical results in the main
article, a Hartree--Fock reference is used in this calculations.
Fig.~\ref{fig:2469occ}(a) shows a very slow convergence of $\textrm{min}_i
\left[T_i(\mathbf{q}) \right] \to -0.5$ for $\mathbf{q} \to 0$, whereas (b)
shows the structure factor for both electron numbers. Finally,
Fig.~\ref{fig:2469occ}(c) shows the largest t-amplitude element on an absolute
scale for a given $\mathbf{q}$-point.  It can be seen that the theoretical
expected $1/|\mathbf{q}|$ divergence for small values of $\mathbf{q}$ sets in
only for very large electron numbers. This is a consequence of the finite size
error.  In all calculations, roughly 18 virtual spatial orbitals per occupied
spatial orbital are used.

%Fig.~\ref{fig:hf}(b) and Fig.~\ref{fig:free}(b) show the corresponding drCCD structure factors which exhibit
%a very similar behaviour and both appear to converge to zero for $\mathbf{q} \to 0$.

\section{Molecular testset}

Table~\ref{tab:mol} summarizes
correlation energy contributions
obtained using different triple particle-hole excitation approximations. The
geometries can be found in the work of Knizia et al. \cite{Knizia2009}. For
these calculations the Hartree--Fock ground state was obtained with the NWChem
package~\cite{Valiev2010} and interfaced to cc4s~\cite{cc4s} as described in
Ref.~\cite{Gallo2021}.  The here employed testset was already used in
a previous work \cite{Irmler2021}.  This is where Hartree--Fock and CCSD
energies for the given molecules can be found.

\section{Perturbative triple particle-hole excitation methods}
%We have to provide some context about t1,t2,v, and f

In this section we present the full (cT) equations complementing Eq.~(8) in the
main article.  In addition we present the equations for (T), (cT)-ring,
(cT)-rest as they are used in the article.  The following equation is used for
all employed methods
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
with different definitions for $J^{\text{(X)}}$ for $X \in \text{(T), (cT), (cT)-ring, (cT)-rest}$ as defined below.
We note that $J^{\text{(cT)-rest}}$ is defined implicitely via

\section{Computational details on the calculations of metallic lithium}

Metallic body-centered cubic (BCC) lithium is considered.
All calculations are performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)~\cite{kresse1996} for HF and MP2 energies, as well as cc4s code~\cite{cc4s} for coupled cluster energies. 
VASP is based on periodic boundary conditions and makes use of the projector augmented-wave (PAW) formalism~\cite{Kresse1999}.
We consider one valence electron per Li atom, using the PAW POTCAR file labeled as $\texttt{Li\_GW}$ and a plane-wave cutoff parameter of $\texttt{ENCUT} = 141\,\text{eV}$.

For efficient coupled cluster calculations, a compression of the unoccupied HF manifold is achieved via approximate MP2 natural orbitals (NOs)~\cite{gruneis11}, while a low-rank decomposition is employed to compress the Coulomb integrals as described in Ref.~\cite{hummel_2017}.
Both schemes introduce a controlable error which is kept well below $10^{-2}$ mHa for the low-rank decomposition of the Coulomb integrals.
The basis-set error of the CCSD correlation contribution, as introduced by the restricted number of NOs, is converged to sub-mHa accuracy using a recently proposed focal-point correction scheme (here denoted as FPC)~\cite{Irmler2021}, as can be observed in Fig. \ref{fig:Li}(b).
For the (cT) and (T) correlation contribution, a relatively small number of 5 NOs per occupied orbital is used and corrected by an $1/N_{NO}$ extrapolation from 5 to 10 NOs using a simulation cell containing 26 Li atoms.
This is sufficient, since the basis-set dependence of both (cT) and (T) is weak.

Furthermore, the core-valence contribution to the correlation energy is estimated by an all-electron PAW POTCAR file labeled as $\texttt{Li\_AE\_GW}$. In this case three electrons per Li atom are considered as valence electrons. Since the $1\text s^2$ HF orbitals are located about $-63\,\text{eV}$ below the Fermi level, we consider the MP2 method as sufficient for this task. Here a plane-wave cutoff of $\texttt{ENCUT} = 543\,\text{eV}$ is used. The individual contributions to the atomization energy of bulk bcc lithium are reported in the main document. 

\section{Thermodynamic limit extrapolation}

Fig \ref{fig:Li}(a)+(c) depicts the thermodynamic limit extrapolation of the HF and CCSD correlation energies of  bulk bcc lithium.
The corresponding numerical data is summarized in Tab.\ref{tab:dat1}. 
We find that using the extrapolation law of $(N_kN_\text{atoms})^{-2/3}$ fits the computed energies and enables a precise extrapolation.
Here $N_k$ denotes the number of k-points used to sample the first Brillouin zone. We note that Brillouin zone sampling
with more than one k-point is not yet supported in cc4s.
Therefore all post-HF calculations employ $N_k=1$ and large supercells with geometries given below.
However, twist-averaging is used to reduce the fluctuations due to discretization errors of the finite simulation cells. The geometries and
atomic structures of these cells are given below.
The employed power law for the extrapolation to the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$ is well justified by the linear behaviour of the
CCSD structure factor in the long wave length limit $\mathbf{q}\rightarrow0$. However, this also implies that the system sizes included
in such an extrapolation have to be large enough to sample sufficiently short wavevectors in reciprocal space where the
structure factor approaches $\mathbf{q}\rightarrow0$ linearly.

The extrapolation of the (cT) correlation energy contribution for lithium shown in the main article, employs an $(N_\text{atoms})^{-2/3}$ fit and system sizes of 128 and 208 atoms.
We note, however, that the (cT) correlation energies obtained for smaller systems deviate from the employed extrapolation law. To estimate the
remaining uncertainty in the thermodynamic limit extrapolation of the (cT) energy we have performed the following analysis based on the UEG.

Fig.~\ref{fig:UEG_TDL} depicts the (cT) correlation energies of the UEG for a range of electron numbers at a density corresponding to $r_{\rm s}$=3.2. This density and the
employed basis set sizes are identical to the calculations for lithium.
Our findings indicate that the difference between thermodynamic limit extrapolations employing the $(N)^{-2/3}$ fits and system sizes corresponding
to 358-610 electrons and 128-208 electrons deviate by less than 0.5~mHa/electron.
Furthermore the extrapolated estimates using 358-610 electrons and 208-358 electrons correspond to -5.2~mHa/electron and -5.3~mHa/electron, deviating by less than 0.1~mHa/electron.
From this we estimate that the remaining uncertainty in our estimate of the (cT) contribution to the 
lithium cohesive energy obtained from extrapolations using 128 and 208 atoms is below 1~mHa/atom.
Tab.~\ref{tab:dat2} summarizes the numerical data of (cT) energies for the UEG and lithium.

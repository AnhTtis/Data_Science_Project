We present several variants of robustness measures that indicate how far a given trajectory stands, in space and time, from satisfying or violating a property. We present a method to compute these robustness measures as well as their sensitivity to the parameters of the system or parameters appearing in the formula. Combined with an appropriate strategy for exploring the parameter space, this technique can be used to guide simulation-based verification of complex nonlinear and hybrid systems against temporal properties. Our methodology can be used for other non-traditional applications of temporal logic such as characterizing subsets of the parameter space for which a system is guaranteed to satisfy a formula with a desired robustness degree.",

Logical languages are widely used for expressing the declarative knowledge needed in artificial intelligence systems. Symbolic logic also provides a clear semantics for knowledge representation languages and a methodology for analyzing and comparing deductive inference techniques. Several observations gained from experience with the approach are discussed. Finally, we confront some challenging problems for artificial intelligence and describe what is being done in an attempt to solve them.}

	abstract = {This article demonstrates that there is a fundamental relationship between temporal logic and languages that involve multiple stages, such as those used to analyze binding times in the context of partial evaluation. This relationship is based on an extension of the Curry-Howard isomorphism, which identifies proofs with programs, and propositions with types. Our extension involves the “next time” (○) operator from linear-time temporal logic and yields a λ-calculus λ° with types of the form ○ A for expressions in the subsequent stage, with appropriate introduction and elimination forms. We demonstrate that λ° is equivalent to the core of a previously studied multilevel binding-time analysis. This is similar to work by Davies and Pfenning on staged computation based on the necessity (□) operator of modal logic, but □ only allows closed code, and naturally supports a code evaluation construct, whereas ○ captures open code, thus is more flexible, but is incompatible with such a construct. Instead, code evaluation is an external global operation that is validated by the proof theory regarding closed proofs of ○ formulas. We demonstrate the relevance of λ° to staged computation directly by showing that that normalization can be done in an order strictly following the times of the logic. We also extend λ° to small functional language and show that it would serve as a suitable basis for directly programming with multiple stages by presenting some example programs.},

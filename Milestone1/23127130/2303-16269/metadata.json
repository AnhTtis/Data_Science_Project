    "abstract": "We prove $H^{1}$ scattering for a defocusing NLS on the line with fully variable coefficients. The result is proved by adapting the Kenig--Merle scheme to a non translation invariant setting. In addition, we give an abstract version of the scheme which can be applied to other operators.",

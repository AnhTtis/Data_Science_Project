    "abstract": "A well-known result states that empirical quantiles for finitely distributed univariate random variables can be obtained by solving a linear program. We show in this short note that multivariate empirical quantiles can be obtained in a very similar way by solving a vector linear program. This connection provides a new approach for computing Tukey depth regions and more general cone quantile sets.",

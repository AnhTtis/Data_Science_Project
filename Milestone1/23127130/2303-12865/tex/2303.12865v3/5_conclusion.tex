\section{Conclusion}
We presented a method to distill a pretrained NeRF-GAN into a pose-conditioned convolutional generator. The proposed method enables considerably higher efficiency, which is crucial if 3D neural rendering is to become ubiquitous and deployed at scale. To do so, we proposed exploiting the intermediate latent space of the pretrained NeRF-GAN as a conditioning input of the convolutional generator. We additionally provided a training protocol to further improve the visual quality and 3D consistency of the images generated using our generator. Through our experiments, we showed that our method maintains good image quality and 3D consistency, significantly better than previous existing fully-convolutional methods and approaching that of the baseline NeRF-GAN with volumetric rendering. Finally, while our method takes steps toward achieving full correspondence between the two rendering methods, there remains a gap in terms of image semantics. Improving this aspect remains a subject for further research.

    "abstract": "We developed and optimized two novel categories of spin transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs), featuring a high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio, low critical current, and out-oscillation behavior, which demonstrates their potential for low-power, high-speed, and reliable spintronic applications such as magnetic memory, logic, and signal processing. The SST-MTJs based on NiFe showed lower critical currents for auto-oscillation as compared to those based on CofeSiB. Using VSM measurements that established comparable saturation magnetization and anisotropy field for both stacks, we attributed this observation to the higher damping of A-MTJs compared to B-MTJs. This hypothesis was verified through the all-optical time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TRMOKE) technique, which confirmed that STT-MTJs with lower damping exhibited auto-oscillation at lower critical current values. Beside, our study aimed to optimize the STT-MTJ performance, regarding the capping layer's impact on the device's response to electronic and optical stimuli.",

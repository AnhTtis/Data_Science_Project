    "abstract": "This paper investigates the circuit synthesis problem for a certain positive-real bicubic (third-order) admittance with a simple pole at the origin (s = 0) to be realizable as a one-port series-parallel damper-spring-inerter circuit consisting of at most six elements, where the results can be directly applied to the design and physical realization of inerter-based control systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for such a specific bicubic admittance to be realizable by a one-port passive series-parallel mechanical circuit containing at most six elements are derived, and a group of mechanical circuit configurations covering the whole set of realizability conditions are presented together with element value expressions. The conditions and element value expressions are related to the admittance coefficients and the roots of certain algebraic equations. The circuit synthesis results of this paper are illustrated by several numerical examples including the control system design of a train suspension system. Any realization circuit in this paper contains much fewer passive elements than the ten-element realization circuit by the well-known Bott-Duffin circuit synthesis approach. The investigations of this paper can contribute to the theory of circuit synthesis and many other related fields.",

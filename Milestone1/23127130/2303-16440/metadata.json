    "abstract": "We prove a full measurable version of Vizing's theorem for bounded degree Borel graphs, that is, we show that every Borel graph $\\mathcal{G}$ of degree uniformly bounded by $Δ\\in \\mathbb{N}$ defined on a standard probability space $(X,μ)$ admits a $μ$-measurable proper edge coloring with $(Δ+1)$-many colors. This answers a question of Marks [Question 4.9, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 29 (2016)] also stated in Kechris and Marks as a part of [Problem 6.13, survey (2020)], and extends the result of the author and Pikhurko [Adv. Math. 374, (2020)] who derived the same conclusion under the additional assumption that the measure $μ$ is $\\mathcal{G}$-invariant.",

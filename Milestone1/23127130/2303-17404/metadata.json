    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a stochastic Augmented Lagrangian approach on (possibly infinite-dimensional) Riemannian manifolds to solve stochastic optimization problems with a finite number of deterministic constraints. We investigate the convergence of the method, which is based on a stochastic approximation approach with random stopping combined with an iterative procedure for updating Lagrange multipliers. The algorithm is applied to a multi-shape optimization problem with geometric constraints and demonstrated numerically.",

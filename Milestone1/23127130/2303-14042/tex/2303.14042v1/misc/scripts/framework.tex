\caption{The proposed compression pipeline.
%
Given an image, we extract its CAM-based (baseline) or CIM-based (ours) mask, threshold it to be a 0-1 mask with a fixed threshold $\tau$, and generate a tight bounding box (bbox) that covers all masked pixels. Then, we downsample the pixels outside the bbox and sum the downsampled image up to the masked image to generate the final compressed image.}

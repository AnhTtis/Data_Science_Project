\section{Conclusions}
\label{section: conclusions}


We introduced a novel exemplar compression method for CIL, allowing us to save more representative exemplars but not increase memory budget. We achieved this compression by downsampling non-discriminative pixels of the image bounded by CAM masks.
%
To generate adaptive masks, we proposed a novel method CIM that explicitly parameterizes a mask generation model and optimizes it in an end-to-end manner across incremental phases. Our method achieves consistent performance improvements over multiple baselines and can be taken as a flexible plug-and-play module.

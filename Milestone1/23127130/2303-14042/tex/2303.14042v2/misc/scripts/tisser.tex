   The phase-wise training data in different methods. (a) iCaRL~\cite{rebuffi2017icarl} is the baseline method using full new class data and few-shot old class exemplars.
   (b) Mnemonics~\cite{liu2020mnemonics} distills all training samples into few-shot exemplars without increasing their quantity. (c) MRDC~\cite{wang2022memory} compresses each exemplar uniformly into a low-resolution image using JPEG~\cite{wallace1991jpeg}.
   (d) Our approach based on the proposed class-incremental masking (CIM) downsamples only non-discriminative pixels in the image.
   The legend shows the symbols of special images generated by the methods.

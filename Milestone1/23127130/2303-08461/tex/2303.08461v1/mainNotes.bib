@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="For example, a state vector simulation scales linearly in the number of Trotter steps but exponentially with the system size. While a tensor network simulation scales polynomially in system size but exponentially with the number of Trotter steps."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="In the case of degenerate Hamiltonian spectrum, one can still diagonalize the observable projected onto each subspace of Hamiltonian eigenvalue to define the diagonal ensemble as long time average"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="In experiments, XY rotations are sometimes compiled into more than one two-qubit gate. The value of $p$ should then be increased accordingly."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="Even though amplitude damping error is not included in this class of channels, we find that the conclusions of this section nevertheless hold to a good approximation. See Appendix~\ref {sec:supp_plot} for numerical results."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="To obtain this equation, the circuit in Fig.~\ref {fig:scaling}a has to be slightly modified: during backward evolution, the error gates occur before each evolution unitary gate instead of after it."}

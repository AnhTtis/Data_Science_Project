    "abstract": "The temporal stability of iris recognition performance is core to its success as a biometric modality. With the expanding horizon of applications for children, gaps in the knowledge base on the temporal stability of iris recognition performance in children have impacted decision-making during applications at the global scale. This report presents the most extensive analysis of longitudinal iris recognition performance in children with data from the same 230 children over 6.5 years between enrollment and query for ages 4 to 17 years. Assessment of match scores, statistical modelling of variability factors impacting match scores and in-depth assessment of the root causes of the false rejections concludes no impact on iris recognition performance due to aging.",

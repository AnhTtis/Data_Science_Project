    "abstract": "Siamese network based trackers develop rapidly in the field of visual object tracking in recent years. The majority of siamese network based trackers now in use treat each channel in the feature maps generated by the backbone network equally, making the similarity response map sensitive to background influence and hence challenging to focus on the target region. Additionally, there are no structural links between the classification and regression branches in these trackers, and the two branches are optimized separately during training. Therefore, there is a misalignment between the classification and regression branches, which results in less accurate tracking results. In this paper, a Target Highlight Module is proposed to help the generated similarity response maps to be more focused on the target region. To reduce the misalignment and produce more precise tracking results, we propose a corrective loss to train the model. The two branches of the model are jointly tuned with the use of corrective loss to produce more reliable prediction results. Experiments on 5 challenging benchmark datasets reveal that the method outperforms current models in terms of performance, and runs at 38 fps, proving its effectiveness and efficiency.",

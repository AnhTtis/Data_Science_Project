    "abstract": "Energy efficiency (EE) problem has become an important and major issue in satellite communications. In this paper, we study the beamforming design strategy to maximize the EE of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for the multibeam satellite communications by considering imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). We propose an expectation-based robust beamforming algorithm against the imperfect CSIT scenario. By combining the successive convex approximation (SCA) with the penalty function transformation, the nonconvex EE maximization problem can be solved in an iterative manner. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of RSMA over traditional space division multiple access (SDMA). Moreover, our proposed beamforming algorithm can achieve better EE performance than the conventional beamforming algorithm.",

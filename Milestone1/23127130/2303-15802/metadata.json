    "abstract": "It has been proved in [5] that the collection of all torsion classes over a finite-dimensional algebra is always a completely semidistributive lattice. In the present paper, we considered the semimodularity and distributivity of the collection of (functorially finite) torsion classes. In such cases, some equivalent descriptions of the algebra are described.",

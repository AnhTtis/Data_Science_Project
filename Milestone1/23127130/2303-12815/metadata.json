    "abstract": "In this paper, we obtain exact phantom (A)dS black hole solutions in the context of $F(R)$ gravity with topological spacetime in four dimensions. Then, we study the effects of different parameters on the event horizon. In the following, we calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the system and check the first law of thermodynamics for these kinds of black holes. Next, we evaluate the local stability of the topological phantom (A)dS black holes in $F(R)$ gravity by studying the heat capacity and the geometrothemodynamic, where we show that the two approaches agrees. We extend our study and investigate global stability by employing the Gibbs potential and the Helmholtz free energy. In addition, the effects of different parameters on local and global stabilities will be highlighted.",

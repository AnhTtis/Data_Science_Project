    "abstract": "One issue with the analysis of complex systems and the interaction between such systems is that they are composed of different number of components, or simply the fact that a different number of observables is available for each system. The challenge is how to analyze the interaction of two systems which are not described by the same number of variables. The approach is to combine different types and number of time series so that they yield a matched set of data points from which coupling or correlation properties can be estimated. Here, we present multidimensional joint recurrence quantification analysis (MdJRQA), a recurrence-based technique that allows to analyze coupling properties between multivariate data sets that differ in dimensionality (i.e., number of observables) and type of data (such as nominal or interval-scaled, for example). First, we introduce the methods, and then test it on simulated data from linear and nonlinear systems. Finally, we discuss practical issue regarding the application of the method.",

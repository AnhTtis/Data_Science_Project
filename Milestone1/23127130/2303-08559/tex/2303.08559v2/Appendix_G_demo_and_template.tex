\section{Details on Adaptive \textit{Filter-then-rerank} Paradigm}

\subsection{Demonstration Examples}
\label{sec: demo example}

We convert few-shot IE tasks to multiple-choice questions in our \textit{filter-then-rerank} paradigm. We show 4 examples used in demonstrations for FewNERD dataset in Table~\ref{tab: NER demos}, for TACREV dataset in Table~\ref{tab: RE demos}, and for ACE05 datasets in Table~\ref{tab: ED demos}.

\label{tab: NER demos}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.95\textwidth}}
\toprule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read following sentences and identify what is the entity type of \textcolor{blue}{392} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: Powell v. Texas , <t> 392 <t> U.S. 514 ( 1968 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case that ruled that a Texas statute criminalizing public intoxication did not violate the Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment. \\
(a) 392 is a legal document, a term or a convention in legal sense.\\
(b) 392 does not belong to any known entities. \\
(c) 392 refers to a protest, uprising or revolution event \\ 
(d) 392 refers to a government or governmental agency \\
\bblack{Analysis}: In the context you provided, 392 refers to the volume number in the United States Reports where the Supreme Court's decision in Powell v. Texas can be found. However, 392 itself does not refer to a legal document. So 392 do/does not belong to any known entities.\\
\bblack{Answer}: (b) \\

\midrule

\bblack{Instruct}: Read following sentences and identify what is the entity type of \textcolor{blue}{The New Yorker} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: In 2004 Gourevitch was assigned to cover the 2004 U.S. presidential election for " <t> The New Yorker <t> ". \\
(a) The New Yorker does not belong to any known entities. \\

It has a reputation for publishing high-quality writing on a wide variety of topics, including politics, culture, and the arts. So The New Yorker is a media/newspaper organization. \\
\bblack{Answer}: (d) \\

\midrule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read following sentence and identify what is the entity type of \textcolor{blue}{St.} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: The May 1980 eruption of Mount <t> St. <t> Helens in the state of Washington seriously affected both 47th Air Division and 92d Bombardment Wing operations at Fairchild AFB , resulting in dispersal of Fairchild 's B-52 and KC-135 aircraft to various bases while around-the-clock shifts removed the volcanic ash from facilities within the base perimeter. '' \\
(a) St. does not belong to any known entities. \\
(b) St. is a natural disaster event.\\
(c) St. is a geographic position about mountain. \\
\bblack{Analysis}: According to the context, St. is an abbreviation of Saint, used in the name of Mount St. Helens, which is an active volcano in the state of Washington. However, St. itself does not refer to anything. So St. do/does not belong to any known entities. \\
\bblack{Answer}: (a) \\

\midrule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read following sentence and identify what is the entity type of \textcolor{blue}{Ridzuan} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: <t> Ridzuan <t> was promoted to Harimau Muda A for 2014 season .\\
(a) Ridzuan does not belong to any known entities. \\
(b) Ridzuan is a person, but not affiliated with following professions: actor, artist, author, director, politician, scholar, soldier.\\
(c) Ridzuan is an athlete.\\
\bblack{Analysis}: The mention of 'Harimau Muda A' indicates that it is a sports-related context, and 'promoted' implies a progression or advancement within the sports team. So Ridzuan is an athlete. \\

\footnotesize
\caption{Demo examples used in TACREV dataset. We color the subject and object entities in blue.}
\label{tab: RE demos}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.95\textwidth}}
\toprule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read the sentence and determine the relation between \textcolor{blue}{she} and \textcolor{blue}{lawyer} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: The <t> lawyer <t> denied Italian news reports that she wept while addressing the court, but said Knox was upset as <t> she <t> recounted `` the pressure, the aggressiveness of the police who called her a liar . '' \\
(a) she is the other family member of lawyer \\
(b) she is a lawyer \\
(c) she has no known relations to lawyer \\
\bblack{Analysis}: In the sentence, the word 'she' refers to someone who was upset while recounting certain events in court. The word 'lawyer' refers to someone who denied a news report about that same person weeping in court. There is no information in the sentence to indicate that the two individuals are related in any way. So she has no known relations to lawyer. \\
\bblack{Answer}: (c) \\

\midrule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read the sentence and determine the relation between \textcolor{blue}{MEF} and \textcolor{blue}{Myanmar Equestrian Federation} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: YANGON , Dec. 27 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Myanmar will hold a horse race in Yangon to commemorate the country 's 63rd Anniversary Independence Day , the <t> Myanmar Equestrian Federation <t> -LRB- <t> MEF <t> -RRB- confirmed to Xinhua on Monday.\\
(a) MEF is also known as Myanmar Equestrian Federation \\
(b) MEF has political affiliation with Myanmar Equestrian Federation \\
(c) MEF has no known relations to Myanmar Equestrian Federation \\
\bblack{Analysis}: The symbols -LRB- and -RRB- in the sentence stand for left and right round brackets and are used to enclose the abbreviation 'MEF' to indicate that it is a replacement for the longer name 'Myanmar Equestrian Federation. So MEF is also known as Myanmar Equestrian Federation. \\
\bblack{Answer}: (a) \\

\midrule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read the sentence and determine the relation between \textcolor{blue}{Douglas Flint} and \textcolor{blue}{chairman} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: At the same time , Chief Financial Officer <t> Douglas Flint <t> will become <t> chairman <t> , succeeding Stephen Green who is leaving to take a government job. \\
(a) Douglas Flint has no known relations to chairman \\
(b) Douglas Flint is a chairman \\
(c) Douglas Flint is the employee of chairman \\
\bblack{Analysis}: The sentence states that Chief Financial Officer Douglas Flint Douglas Flint will succeed Stephen Green as a chairman. So Douglas Flint is a chairman. \\
\bblack{Answer}: (b) \\

\midrule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read the sentence and determine the relation between \textcolor{blue}{FAA} and \textcolor{blue}{U.S.} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: On its Web site , the <t> U.S. <t> <t> FAA <t> says the Category 2 rating means the country lacks the laws or regulations that are needed for the certification and oversight of air carriers , according to minimum international standards. \\
(a) FAA is also known as U.S. \\
(b) FAA has no known relations to U.S. \\
(c) FAA has a headquarter in the country U.S. \\
\bblack{Analysis}: The sentence states that the FAA says the Category 2 rating means the country lacks the laws or regulations needed for the certification and oversight of air carriers, indicating that the FAA is responsible for overseeing aviation regulations in the country. Actually the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) is a U.S. government agency responsible for regulating and overseeing civil aviation in the United States, and it has its headquarters in Washington, D.C.. So  FAA has a headquarter in the country U.S.. \\
\bblack{Answer}: (c) \\

\begin{table*}[htb]
\centering
\footnotesize
\caption{Demo examples used in ACE05 dataset. We color the trigger word in blue.}
\label{tab: ED demos}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.95\textwidth}}
\toprule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read following sentences and identify what event is triggered by the word \textcolor{blue}{loan} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: Separately , former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers failed on April 29 to make a first repayment of 25 million dollars, plus interest, on a 400-million - dollar <t> loan <t> from MCI, the Journal said, citing SEC documents. \\ 
(a) The word loan does not trigger any known event.\\
(b) The word loan triggers a TRANSFER-MONEY event: giving, receiving, borrowing, or lending money when it is NOT in the context of purchasing something. \\
(c) The word loan triggers a DECLARE-BANKRUPTCY event: an Entity officially requests legal protection from debt collection due to an extremely negative balance sheet.\\
\bblack{Analysis}: In the given sentence, the word loan is used to describe the 400-million-dollar loan from MCI to former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers, which he failed to repay on time. This situation clearly involves a transfer of money without the context of purchasing something, which falls under the TRANSFER-MONEY event. So the word loan triggers a TRANSFER-MONEY event: giving, receiving, borrowing, or lending money when it is NOT in the context of purchasing something. \\
\bblack{Answer}: (b) \\

\midrule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read following sentences and identify what event is triggered by the words \textcolor{blue}{treated} quoted by <t>. \\ 
\bblack{Sentence}: When she 's in Germany , Lynch will be <t> treated <t> for bullet wounds and broken bones .\\
(a) The word treated triggers an INJURE event: a PERSON gets/got injured whether it occurs accidentally, intentionally or even self-inflicted.\\
(b) The word treated does not trigger any known event.\\
(c) The word treated triggers a TRANSPORT event: an ARTIFACT (WEAPON or VEHICLE) or a PERSON is moved from one PLACE (GEOPOLITICAL ENTITY, FACILITY, LOCATION) to another.\\
\bblack{Analysis}: The sentence suggests that Lynch has already been injured and will receive medical treatment in Germany for her injuries. The word 'treated' simply describes the medical care she will receive and does not indicate a new event or action taking place. So the word treated does not trigger any known event.\\
\bblack{Answer}: (b) \\

\midrule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read following sentences and identify what event is triggered by the words \textcolor{blue}{buy} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: And I won't dwell on the irony of an Oracle employee being driven out of Oracle , starting his own company , and forcing Ellison to spend \$ 10.3 billion to get his company -- but not him -- back ( though it does rather delightfully remind me of Coca - Cola basically giving away the bottling franchise and then spending billions to <t> buy <t> it back ) .\\
(a) The word buy triggers a DECLARE-BANKRUPTCY event: an Entity officially requests legal protection from debt collection due to an extremely negative balance sheet.\\
(b) The word buy triggers a TRANSFER-OWNERSHIP event: The buying, selling, loaning, borrowing, giving, or receiving of artifacts or organizations by an individual or organization.\\
(c) The word buy does not trigger any known event.\\
\bblack{Analysis}: In the given sentence, the word buy is used to describe the action of Oracle spending \$10.3 billion to get a company back. This clearly involves the transfer of ownership of the company from one entity to another. So the word buy triggers a TRANSFER-OWNERSHIP event: The buying, selling, loaning, borrowing, giving, or receiving of artifacts or organizations by an individual or organization.\\
\bblack{Answer}: (b) \\

\midrule
\bblack{Instruct}: Read following sentences and identify what event is triggered by the words \textcolor{blue}{set} quoted by <t>. \\
\bblack{Sentence}: British forces also began establishing the country's first postwar administration Tuesday, granting a local sheik power to <t> set <t> up an administrative committee representing the groups in the region.\\
(a) The word set triggers a START-POSITION event: a PERSON elected or appointed begins working for (or changes offices within) an ORGANIZATION or GOVERNMENT.\\
(b) The word set triggers a START-ORG event: a new ORGANIZATION is created.\\
(c) The word set does not trigger any known event.\\
\bblack{Analysis}: The phrase 'set up' specifically implies the creation or establishment of a new organization or entity, rather than simply the word 'set'. So the word set does not trigger any known event. \\
\bblack{Answer}: (c) \\

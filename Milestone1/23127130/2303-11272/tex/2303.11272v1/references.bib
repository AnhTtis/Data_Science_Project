              and personality tests. Client variables in counseling and
              psychotherapy involve the personality of Asian-Americans,
              language problems, the acculturation process, and counseling
              expectations. Therapist variables involve therapist bias,

              and support to empower their self-management and decision making.
              Online health communities have not only become an important
              alternative source of patient-centered information but also
              appear to serve an emotional support role in connecting patients
              who have similar medical conditions. Trust is critical to sustain
              their continuous use and enhance their involvement. This is
              because each community member is typically identified only by a
              pseudonym, important personal information is often revealed, the
              quality of information provided by others varies, and the
              consequences of acting on incorrect advice can be severe. Using
              semi-structured interviews and data from postings, this study
              qualitatively explores the trust development between users of
              forum-based online health communities. Based on data from a wide
              range of medical conditions, we formulated a three-process
              framework for establishing trust that conceptualizes how users
              build trust through the text-based medium and how they progress
              from one process to another. We contribute to theory by extending
              existing variance theories in trust to a hybrid process theory
              which explains the dynamic progression from one state to another.
              It suggests several design foci that can enhance user experience
              of these forums.",

              contexts within which lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and
              queer (LGBTQ) youth and young adults manage their social
              identities and relationships. On one hand, SNSs provide important
              social support; on the other, they comprise another realm for
              victimization and discrimination. Context collapse refers to the
              ways diverse subgroups (e.g., family, co-workers) are often
              united in Facebook networks, which presents unique challenges
              related to outness. In this study, we examine the Facebook
              contexts of a cohort of LGBTQ youth and young adults with regard
              to outness, victimization, social support, and psychological
              distress by first examining descriptive statistics and
              correlations, and then testing a series of multiple regressions
              in an analytic sample of 175 (Mage = 24.02 years) LGBTQ youth.
              Participants reported levels of daily Facebook use comparable to
              other samples of non-LGBTQ youth; however, they reported greater
              use of security controls, which may function as a tool for
              managing outness. Participants reported slightly lower outness
              across relational subgroups on Facebook, and associations between
              outness to relational subgroups were slightly stronger on
              Facebook, illustrating the potential impact of context collapse.
              Regression results showed that great victimization,
              cyberbullying, and the offering of support online were positively
              associated with psychological distress. Study findings illuminate

               spreading rapidly across the globe. This rapid growth presents
               two major challenges. The first pertains to ``role integrity''
               and the second to the possible culture-bound nature of peer
               support; a concern which has attended the emergence of peer
               support in countries that have significantly different
               worldviews.Method: Recognizing the growth of peer support and
               the resulting challenges, this report results from the convening
               of an international consortium of peer leaders from six
               continents (all but Antarctica). Following an environmental scan
               of the state of peer support globally, this group moved to
               develop consensus on a common, core set of guiding principles
               and values to ensure a robust future for the development of
               effective, culturally responsive forms of peer support.Findings:

               the expansion of peer support around the globe. Peer leaders are
               encouraged, however, to develop and deliver peer support both
               with integrity to its founding values in a civil rights and

                   districts are turning to matching algorithms to assign
                   students to public schools. The designers of these
                   algorithms aimed to promote values such as transparency,
                   equity, and community in the process. However, school
                   districts have encountered practical challenges in their

                   modeling assumptions about families' priorities,
                   constraints, and goals that clash with the real world. These

  abstract = "Objective: This research aimed to gain further understanding of
              how open Facebook groups are used for online peer to peer support
              and identify any similarities and/or differences between UK and
              US groups. Method: A systematic search of mental health related
              open Facebook groups was conducted using relevant key words. The
              posts from 14 UK and 11 US groups were acquired over a three
              month period and content thematically analysed using Nvivo.
              Results: Findings support previous research which evidences that
              online peer to peer support is beneficial for users seeking
              mental health information. Said support can increase feelings of
              connectedness, reduce feelings of isolation, and provide a
              platform for comparison of perspectives relating to personal
              experiences. Group membership may offer hope and increase
              feelings of empowerment in those using Facebook groups as a
              support mechanism. There was similar discourse seen throughout
              both UK and US posts in regards to gender inequality, lack of
              awareness and stigmatisation. Conclusions: The study highlights
              the positive impact of shared personal experiences, and offers a
              greater understanding of the benefits of online peer to peer
              support for mental health and wellbeing. There is evidence that,
              whilst mental health is becoming a more widely discussed topic,
              in both the UK and US, it remains negatively perceived. Questions

               (SNS) on well-being has often stressed that SNS can help people
               gain social support from their online networks, which positively
               affects their well-being. However, the majority of studies in
               this area have been cross-sectional in nature and/or relied on
               student samples. Using data from six waves of a longitudinal
               study with a representative sample of Dutch Internet users, we
               first examined whether users and nonusers of SNS differ in
               online social support and well-being (as indicated by life
               satisfaction and stress). In a second step, we investigated in
               more detail how SNS use ? more specifically, asking for advice
               and the number of strong ties on these SNS ? are related to
               online social support, stress, and satisfaction with life.
               Overall, our results provide no evidence for SNS use and online
               social support affecting either stress or life satisfaction. SNS
               users reported more online social support than nonusers did, but
               also higher levels of stress; the two groups did not differ in
               overall life satisfaction. With regard to the underlying
               processes, we found positive cross-sectional and longitudinal
               relationships between asking for advice on SNS and online social
               support, indicating that SNS can be an effective tool for
               receiving social support. However, online social support was not
               related to higher life satisfaction or reduced stress 6 months
               later; instead, it seems that SNS users with lower life
               satisfaction and/or higher stress seek more social support
               online by asking for advice on SNS.",

  abstract  = "Flood warnings from various information sources are important
               for individuals to make evacuation decisions during a flood
               event. In this study, we develop a general opinion dynamics
               model to simulate how individuals update their flood hazard
               awareness when exposed to multiple information sources,
               including global broadcast, social media, and observations of
               neighbors' actions. The opinion dynamics model is coupled with a
               traffic model to simulate the evacuation processes of a
               residential community with a given transportation network.
               Through various scenarios, we investigate how social media
               affect the opinion dynamics and evacuation processes. We find
               that stronger social media can make evacuation processes more
               sensitive to the change of global broadcast and neighbor
               observations, and thus, impose larger uncertainty on evacuation
               rates (i.e., a large range of evacuation rates corresponding to
               sources of information). For instance, evacuation rates are
               lower when social media become more influential and individuals
               have less trust in global broadcast. Stubborn individuals can
               significantly affect the opinion dynamics and reduce evacuation
               rates. In addition, evacuation rates respond to the percentage
               of stubborn agents in a nonlinear manner, i.e., above a
               threshold, the impact of stubborn agents will be intensified by
               stronger social media. These results highlight the role of
               social media in flood evacuation processes and the need to
               monitor social media so that misinformation can be corrected in
               a timely manner. The joint impacts of social media, quality of

               information can be transmitted to the closest neighbouring
               agents. The model's originality consists of the exploitation of
               artificial neuron-based agent schema with a nonlinear activation
               function to determine the reaction delay, the refractory (agent

               empirical questions raised at the beginning. The chapter focuses

              the Internet a sample of 1093 male-to-female and female-to-male
              transgender persons, stratified by gender. Participants completed
              an online survey that included standardized measures of mental
              health. Guided by the minority stress model, we evaluated
              associations between stigma and mental health and tested whether
              indicators of resilience (family support, peer support, identity
              pride) moderated these associations. RESULTS: Respondents had a
              high prevalence of clinical depression (44.1\%), anxiety
              (33.2\%), and somatization (27.5\%). Social stigma was positively

               the effects of a small set of variables. In this article, we
               show how synthesizing insights from multiple, narrowly focused
               social science theories in an agent-based model helps us
               understand factors that lead to the success of online
               communities. The agent-based model combines insights from
               theories related to collective effort, information overload,
               social identity, and interpersonal attraction to predict
               motivations for online community participation. We conducted
               virtual experiments to develop hypotheses around three design
               decisions about how to orchestrate an online community?topical
               breadth, message volume, and discussion moderation?and the
               trade-offs involved in making these decisions. The simulation
               experiments suggest that broad topics and high message volume
               can lead to higher member commitment. Personalized moderation
               outperforms other types of moderation in increasing members'
               commitment and contribution, especially in topically broad
               communities and those with high message volume. In comparison,
               community-level moderation increases commitment but not

               simulation results suggest a critical trade-off between
               informational and relational benefits. This research illustrates
               that there are many interactions among the design decisions that
               are important to consider; the particulars of the community's
               goals often determine the effectiveness of some decisions. It

              the high intensity of face-to-face early intervention treatments,
              this may not be feasible. Adjunctive internet-based interventions
              specifically designed for youth may provide a cost-effective and
              engaging alternative to prevent loss of intervention benefits.
              However, until now online interventions have relied on human
              moderators to deliver therapeutic content. More sophisticated
              models responsive to user data are critical to inform tailored
              online therapy. Thus, integration of user experience with a
              sophisticated and cutting-edge technology to deliver content is
              necessary to redefine online interventions in youth mental
              health. This paper discusses the development of the moderated
              online social therapy (MOST) web application, which provides an
              interactive social media-based platform for recovery in mental
              health. We provide an overview of the system's main features and
              discus our current work regarding the incorporation of advanced
              computational and artificial intelligence methods to enhance user
              engagement and improve the discovery and delivery of therapy

              (5-year randomized controlled trial for youth recovering from
              early psychosis), which is powered by MOST. We outline the
              motivation underlying the project and the web application's
              foundational features and interface. We discuss system
              innovations, including the incorporation of pertinent usage
              patterns as well as identifying certain limitations of the
              system. This leads to our current motivations and focus on using
              computational and artificial intelligence methods to enhance user
              engagement, and to further improve the system with novel
              mechanisms for the delivery of therapy content to users. In

              the software system, observed usage patterns, and the aim to

               improvements in the last several decades. With the advancement
               of urban land-use change theories and modeling techniques, a
               considerable number of models have been developed. The
               relatively young approach, agent-based modeling, provides urban
               land-use models with some new features and can help address the
               challenges faced by traditional models. Applications of
               agent-based models to study urban dynamics have increased
               steadily over the last twenty years. To offer a retrospective on
               the developments in agent-based models (ABMs) of urban
               residential choices, we review fifty-one relevant models that
               fall into three general categories: (i) urban land-use models
               based on classical theories; (ii) different stages of the
               urbanization process; and (iii) integrated agent-based and
               microsimulation models. We summarize and compare the main
               features of these fifty-one models within each category. This
               review focuses on three fundamental new features introduced
               byABMs. The first is agent heterogeneity with particular
               attention to the method of introducing heterogeneity in agents'
               attributes and behaviors. The second is the representation of
               land-market processes, namely preferences, resources
               constraints, competitive bidding, and endogenous relocation. The
               third is the method of measuring the extensive model outputs. In
               addition, we outline accompanying challenges to, and open
               questions for, incorporating these new features. We conclude
               that, by modeling agent heterogeneity and land markets, and by
               exploiting a much broader dimension of output, we will enhance
               our understanding of urban land-use change and are hopefully
               able to improve model fitness and robustness.",

              in real life. In this paper, we present Friendbook, a novel
              semantic-based friend recommendation system for social networks,
              which recommends friends to users based on their life styles
              instead of social graphs. By taking advantage of sensor-rich
              smartphones, Friendbook discovers life styles of users from
              user-centric sensor data, measures the similarity of life styles
              between users, and recommends friends to users if their life
              styles have high similarity. Inspired by text mining, we model a
              user's daily life as life documents, from which his/her life
              styles are extracted by using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
              algorithm. We further propose a similarity metric to measure the
              similarity of life styles between users, and calculate users'
              impact in terms of life styles with a friend-matching graph. Upon
              receiving a request, Friendbook returns a list of people with

              Friendbook integrates a feedback mechanism to further improve the
              recommendation accuracy. We have implemented Friendbook on the

               Senior undergraduates formed groups and competed within
               five-firm (group) industries over 10 weeks, as well as
               submitting group reports on their performances. Performance and
               report marks were independent of group size and individual
               performance in other course assessment. Women per group
               (numbers, percentage, gender ratio) was positively related to
               simulation performance, with few women-dominated groups ranking
               lower than first or second within each industry. Very few
               all-men groups achieved first or second rankings. There were no
               significant correlations between group gender compositions and
               marks for the group written report. Women's more interactive,
               people-oriented and co-operative work styles apparently

  abstract = "An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced
              datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the
              classification categories are not approximately equally
              represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately
              composed of ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of
              ``abnormal'' or ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case
              that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example
              as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the
              reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has
              been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a
              classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a
              combination of our method of over-sampling the minority
              (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class
              can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than
              only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows
              that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority
              class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better
              classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss
              ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of
              over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic
              minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5,

              possible benefits of working as a CPS. METHOD: A statewide survey
              of trained CPSs in Pennsylvania was conducted in Winter/Spring
              2010. A total of 271 CPSs responded to the online survey. Data

              respondents (28.7\%) were not working prior to their CPS
              employment and 60\% of all respondents reported a decrease in
              Social Security entitlements. Statistically significant

              base, yet users can struggle to identify suitable peer mentors as
              these communities grow. To facilitate mentoring connections, we
              designed a peer-matching system that automatically profiles and
              recommends peer mentors to mentees based on person-generated
              health data (PGHD). This study examined the profile
              characteristics that mentees value when choosing a peer mentor.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a mixed-methods user study, in
              which cancer patients and caregivers evaluated peer mentor
              recommendations, we examined the relative importance of four
              possible profile elements: health interests, language style,
              demographics, and sample posts. Playing the role of mentees, the
              study participants ranked mentors, then rated both the likelihood
              that they would hypothetically contact each mentor and the
              helpfulness of each profile element in helping the make that
              decision. We analyzed the participants' ratings with linear
              regression and qualitatively analyzed participants' feedback for
              emerging themes about choosing mentors and improving profile
              design. RESULTS: Of the four profile elements, only sample posts
              were a significant predictor for the likelihood of a mentee
              contacting a mentor. Communication cues embedded in posts were
              critical for helping the participants choose a compatible mentor.
              Qualitative themes offer insight into the interpersonal
              characteristics that mentees sought in peer mentors, including
              being knowledgeable, sociable, and articulate. Additionally, the
              participants emphasized the need for streamlined profiles that
              minimize the time required to choose a mentor. CONCLUSION:
              Peer-matching systems in online health communities offer a
              promising approach for leveraging PGHD to connect patients. Our
              findings point to interpersonal communication cues embedded in

  abstract      = "We develop a agent-based framework to model the emergence of
                   collective emotions, which is applied to online communities.
                   Agents individual emotions are described by their valence
                   and arousal. Using the concept of Brownian agents, these
                   variables change according to a stochastic dynamics, which
                   also considers the feedback from online communication.
                   Agents generate emotional information, which is stored and
                   distributed in a field modeling the online medium. This
                   field affects the emotional states of agents in a non-linear
                   manner. We derive conditions for the emergence of collective
                   emotions, observable in a bimodal valence distribution.
                   Dependent on a saturated or a superlinear feedback between
                   the information field and the agent's arousal, we further
                   identify scenarios where collective emotions only appear
                   once or in a repeated manner. The analytical results are
                   illustrated by agent-based computer simulations. Our
                   framework provides testable hypotheses about the emergence
                   of collective emotions, which can be verified by data from
                   online communities.",

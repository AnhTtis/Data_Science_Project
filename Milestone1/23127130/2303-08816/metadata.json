    "abstract": "Dueling bandits are widely used to model preferential feedback that is prevalent in machine learning applications such as recommendation systems and ranking. In this paper, we study the Borda regret minimization problem for dueling bandits, which aims to identify the item with the highest Borda score while minimizing the cumulative regret. We propose a new and highly expressive generalized linear dueling bandits model, which covers many existing models. Surprisingly, the Borda regret minimization problem turns out to be difficult, as we prove a regret lower bound of order $Ω(d^{2/3} T^{2/3})$, where $d$ is the dimension of contextual vectors and $T$ is the time horizon. To attain the lower bound, we propose an explore-then-commit type algorithm, which has a nearly matching regret upper bound $\\tilde{O}(d^{2/3} T^{2/3})$. When the number of items/arms $K$ is small, our algorithm can achieve a smaller regret $\\tilde{O}( (d \\log K)^{1/3} T^{2/3})$ with proper choices of hyperparameters. We also conduct empirical experiments on both synthetic data and a simulated real-world environment, which corroborate our theoretical analysis.",

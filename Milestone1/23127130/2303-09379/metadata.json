    "abstract": "Placed in cavity resonators with three-dimensionally confined electromagnetic wave, the interaction between quasiparticles in solids can be induced by exchanging virtual cavity photons, which can have a non-local characteristic. Here we investigate the possibility of utilizing this nonlocality to realize the remote control of the topological transition in mesoscopic moiré superlattices at full filling (one electron/hole per supercell) embedded in a split-ring terahertz electromagnetic resonator. We show that gate tuning one moiré superlattice can remotely drive a topological band inversion in another moiré superlattice not in contact but embedded in the same cavity. Our study of remote on/off switching of a topological transition provides a novel paradigm for the control of material properties via cavity vacuum fields.",

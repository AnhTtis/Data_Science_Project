@article{Li2018,
abstract = {Under strong noise, contaminated microphone signals can deteriorate smart devices' recognition abilities seriously. Therefore, we need a non-acoustic approach to assist us to "talk" to machines in these situations. Many existing researches require users to keep focusing on the camera, or wear the specific gadgets (i.e., probes or beacons) on the cheeks, or even on the tongue. These requirements constrain their usages in practice. To this end, we propose a novel method of non-acoustic speech recognition based on the in-ear photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. The in-ear PPG signals can be obtained by some smart ear buds now. This is an easier wear approach. In our method, we exploit the motion artifacts (MAs), a kind of noise caused by the user's motions, e.g., the movements of the mouth and facial muscles. To predict the words which the user is speak, We extract 13 features from the in-ear PPG signals with the MAs. 3 types of classifiers are used to verify our method. Users speak a word in a given finite words set and our method recognizes which word are spoken. Four Chinese characters, i.e., the east, the west, the south and the north are selected as the finite set. We accomplish a precision rate of about 83{\%} by using a random forest classifier. In a word, it is feasible to predict speeches with in-ear PPG signals.},

Here, we present results from a group decision-making task known as the volunteer's dilemma and demonstrate that a Bayesian model based on partially observable Markov decision processes outperforms existing models in quantitatively predicting human behavior and outcomes of group interactions. Our results suggest that in decision-making tasks involving large groups with anonymous members, humans use Bayesian inference to model the “mind of the group,” making predictions of others' decisions while also simulating the effects of their own actions on the group's dynamics in the future.},

Early results show that the system can be used to detect the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). OSAS is traditionally diagnosed using polysomnography, which requires a whole night stay at the sleep laboratory of a hospital, where the patient is attached to multiple electrodes and sensors. Our system detects heartbeats, breathing, snoring, sleeping positions and movements using a special electret microphone and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The system first analyses the sleep using the acoustic information provided by the electret microphone. From the acoustic information breathing events and heartbeats are identified. The system also analyses the patient's activity and positions from data delivered by the IMU. The information from both sensors is fused to detect sleep events. First experiments show that the system is capable of detecting and interpreting relevant data to improve sleep monitoring.},

abstract = {Nowadays, considerable number of devices have been proposed to monitor cardiovascular health. To protect medical data on these devices from unauthorized access, researchers have proposed ECG-based and heart sound-based authentication methods. However, their vulnerabilities to replay attacks have recently been revealed. In this paper, we leverage liveness detection to enhance heart sound-based authentication against replay attacks. We utilize the inherent correlation between sounds and chest motion caused by deep breathing to realize a reliable liveness detection system, BreathLive. To be specific, BreathLive captures breathing sounds and chest motion simultaneously, and then eliminates signal delay caused by any imperfections of device components. Next, it extracts a set of features to characterize the correlation between sounds and motion signals, and uses them to train the classifier. We implement and evaluated BreathLive under different attacking scenarios and contexts. The results show that BreathLive achieves an equal error rate of 4.0{\%}, 6.4{\%} and 8.3{\%} for random impersonation attacks, advanced impersonation attacks and advanced replay attacks respectively, which indicates its effectiveness in defending against different attacks. Also the extensive experiments prove the system can be robust to different contexts with a small training set.},

Unlike our initial designs, which utilize custom earpieces and require a costly and time-consuming manufacturing process, we here introduce the generic earpieces to make ear-EEG suitable for immediate and widespread use. Our approach represents a departure from silicone earmoulds to provide a sensor based on a viscoelastic substrate and conductive cloth electrodes, both of which are shown to possess a number of desirable mechanical and electrical properties. Owing to its viscoelastic nature, such an earpiece exhibits good conformance to the shape of the ear canal, thus providing stable electrode-skin interface, while cloth electrodes require only saline solution to establish low impedance contact. The analysis highlights the distinguishing advantages compared with the current state-of-the-art in ear-EEG. We demonstrate that such a device can be readily used for the measurement of various EEG responses.},

abstract = {To develop a digital algorithm that detects first and second heart sounds, defines the systole and diastole, and characterises the systolic murmur. Heart sounds were recorded in 300 children with a cardiac murmur, using an electronic stethoscope. A Digital algorithm was developed for detection of first and second heart sounds. R-waves and T-waves in the electrocardiography were used as references for detection. The sound signal analysis was carried out using the short-time Fourier transform. The first heart sound detection rate, with reference to the R-wave, was 100{\%} within 0.05-0.2R-R interval. The second heart sound detection rate between the end of the T-wave and the 0.6R-R interval was 97{\%}. The systolic and diastolic phases of the cardiac cycle could be identified. Because of the overlap between heart sounds and murmur a systolic segment between the first and second heart sounds (20-70{\%}) was selected for murmur analysis. The maximum intensity of the systolic murmur, its average frequency, and the mean spectral power were quantified. The frequency at the point with the highest sound intensity in the spectrum and its time from the first heart sound, the highest frequency, and frequency range were also determined. This method will serve as the foundation for computer-based detection of heart sounds and the characterisation of cardiac murmurs. {\textcopyright} 2005 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

abstract = {Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Rapid diagnosis and initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the cornerstone of therapy for victims of cardiac arrest. Yet a significant fraction of cardiac arrest victims have no chance of survival because they experience an unwitnessed event, often in the privacy of their own homes. An under-appreciated diagnostic element of cardiac arrest is the presence of agonal breathing, an audible biomarker and brainstem reflex that arises in the setting of severe hypoxia. Here, we demonstrate that a support vector machine (SVM) can classify agonal breathing instances in real-time within a bedroom environment. Using real-world labeled 9-1-1 audio of cardiac arrests, we train the SVM to accurately classify agonal breathing instances. We obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.998 and an operating point with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 97.03{\%} (95{\%} CI: 96.62 -- 97.41{\%}) and 98.20{\%} (95{\%} CI: 97.87 -- 98.49{\%}). We achieve a false positive rate between 0{\%} -- 0.10{\%} over 82 hours (117,895 audio segments) of polysomnographic sleep lab data that includes snoring, hypopnea, central and obstructive sleep apnea events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our contactless system in identifying real-world cardiac arrest-associated agonal breathing instances and successfully evaluate our classifier using commodity smart devices (Amazon Echo and Apple iPhone).},

abstract = {The presence of middle ear fluid is a key diagnostic marker for two of the most common pediatric ear diseases: Acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. We present an accessible solution that uses speakers and microphones within existing smartphones to detect middle ear fluid by assessing eardrum mobility. We conducted a clinical study on 98 patient ears at a pediatric surgical center. Using leave-one-out cross-validation to estimate performance on unseen data, we obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.898 for the smartphone-based machine learning algorithm. In comparison, commercial acoustic reflectometry, which requires custom hardware, achieved an AUC of 0.776. Furthermore, we achieved 85{\%} sensitivity and 82{\%} specificity, comparable to published performance measures for tympanometry and pneumatic otoscopy. Similar results were obtained when testing across multiple smartphone platforms. Parents of pediatric patients (n = 25 ears) demonstrated similar performance to trained clinicians when using the smartphone-based system. These results demonstrate the potential for a smartphone to be a low-barrier and effective screening tool for detecting the presence of middle ear fluid.},

@article{Bui2019,
abstract = {Frequent blood pressure (BP) assessment is key to the diagnosis and treatment of many severe diseases, such as heart failure, kidney failure, hypertension, and hemodialysis. Current "gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.},

abstract = {For future healthcare applications, which are increasingly moving towards out-of-hospital or home-based caring models, the ability to remotely and continuously monitor patients' conditions effectively are imperative. Among others, emotional state is one of the conditions that could be of interest to doctors or caregivers. This paper discusses a preliminary study to develop a wearable device that is a low cost, single channel, dry contact, in-ear EEG suitable for non-intrusive monitoring. All aspects of the designs, engineering, and experimenting by applying machine learning for emotion classification, are covered. Based on the valence and arousal emotion model, the device is able to classify basic emotion with 71.07{\%} accuracy (valence), 72.89{\%} accuracy (arousal), and 53.72{\%} (all four emotions). The results are comparable to those measured from the more conventional EEG headsets at T7 and T8 scalp positions. These results, together with its earphone-like wearability, suggest its potential usage especially for future healthcare applications, such as home-based or tele-monitoring systems as intended.},

We find that face-related movements change air pressure inside the ear canals, which shows characteristic changes depending on the type and degree of the movement. We also find that such characteristic changes can be used to recognize face-related movements. We conduct an experiment to measure the accuracy of recognition. As a result, random forest shows per-user recognition accuracies of 87.6{\%} for eleven face-related movements and 87.5{\%} for four Open Mouth levels.},

@article{Amesaka2019,
abstract = {In this study, we propose a new input method for mobile and wearable computing using facial expressions. Facial muscle movements induce physical deformation in the ear canal. Our system utilizes such characteristics and estimates facial expressions using the ear canal transfer function (ECTF). Herein, a user puts on earphones with an equipped microphone that can record an internal sound of the ear canal. The system transmits ultrasonic band-limited swept sine signals and acquires the ECTF by analyzing the response. An important novelty feature of our method is that it is easy to incorporate into a product because the speaker and the microphone are equipped with many hearables, which is technically advanced electronic in-ear-device designed for multiple purposes. We investigated the performance of our proposed method for 21 facial expressions with 11 participants. Moreover, we proposed a signal correction method that reduces positional errors caused by attaching/detaching the device. The evaluation results confirmed that the f-score was 40.2{\%} for the uncorrected signal method and 62.5{\%} for the corrected signal method. We also investigated the practical performance of six facial expressions and confirmed that the f-score was 74.4{\%} for the uncorrected signal method and 90.0{\%} for the corrected signal method. We found the ECTF can be used for recognizing facial expressions with high accuracy equivalent to other related work.},

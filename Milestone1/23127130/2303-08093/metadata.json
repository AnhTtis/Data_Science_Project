    "abstract": "It is a classic result of Selberg in the 1950's that $θ_2 = 2/3$, where $θ_2$ is the exponent of distribution of the divisor function in arithmetic progressions (defined more precisely below). Selberg applies this estimate, together with his $Λ^2$ sieve, to prove weak forms of the Goldbach and twin prime conjectures. In this note, we give another proof of Selberg's first result with smooth weights and for prime moduli and indicate some ways to go pass this stubborn two-thirds barrier.",

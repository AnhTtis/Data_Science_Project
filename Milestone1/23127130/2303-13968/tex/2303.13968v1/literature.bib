abstract = {Amorphous solids show surprisingly universal behaviour at low temperatures. The prevailing wisdom is that this can be explained by the existence of two-state defects within the material. The so-called standard tunneling model has become the established framework to explain these results, yet it still leaves the central question essentially unanswered—what are these two-level defects (TLS)? This question has recently taken on a new urgency with the rise of superconducting circuits in quantum computing, circuit quantum electrodynamics, magnetometry, electrometry and metrology. Superconducting circuits made from aluminium or niobium are fundamentally limited by losses due to TLS within the amorphous oxide layers encasing them. On the other hand, these circuits also provide a novel and effective method for studying the very defects which limit their operation. We can now go beyond ensemble measurements and probe individual defects—observing the quantum nature of their dynamics and studying their formation, their behaviour as a function of applied field, strain, temperature and other properties. This article reviews the plethora of recent experimental results in this area and discusses the various theoretical models which have been used to describe the observations. In doing so, it summarises the current approaches to solving this fundamentally important problem in solid-state physics.}

Control of the tunneling rate between a dot and an electron bath is demonstrated over more than nine orders of magnitude and independently confirmed by direct measurement within the bandwidth of our amplifiers. The inter-dot tunnel coupling at the  charge configuration anti-crossing is directly measured to quantify the control of a single inter-dot tunnel barrier gate. A simple exponential dependence is sufficient to describe each of these tunneling processes as a function of the controlling gate voltage.}

  abstract = {The spin degree of freedom of an electron or a nucleus is one of the most basic properties of nature and functions as an excellent qubit, as it provides a natural two-level system that is insensitive to electric fields, leading to long quantum coherence times. We review the physics of semiconductor spin qubits, focusing not only on the early achievements of spin initialization, control, and readout in GaAs quantum dots, but also on recent advances in Si and Ge spin qubits, including improved charge control and readout, coupling to other quantum degrees of freedom, and scaling to larger system sizes. We begin by introducing the four major types of spin qubits: single spin qubits, donor spin qubits, singlet-triplet spin qubits, and exchange-only spin qubits. We then review the mesoscopic physics of quantum dots, including single-electron charging, valleys, and spin-orbit coupling. We next give a comprehensive overview of the physics of exchange interactions, a crucial resource for single- and two-qubit control in spin qubits. The bulk of this review is centered on the presentation of results from each major spin qubit type, the present limits of fidelity, and a brief overview of alternative spin qubit platforms. We then give a physical description of the impact of noise on semiconductor spin qubits, aided in large part by an introduction to the filter function formalism. Lastly, we review recent efforts to hybridize spin qubits with superconducting systems, including charge-photon coupling, spin-photon coupling, and long-range cavity-mediated spin-spin interactions. Cavity-based readout approaches are also discussed. This review is intended to give an appreciation for the future prospects of semiconductor spin qubits, while highlighting the key advances in mesoscopic physics over the past two decades that underlie the operation of modern quantum-dot and donor spin qubits.},

  abstract = {Electrostatically-defined quantum dots (QDs) in silicon are an attractive platform for quantum computation. Localized single electron spins define qubits and provide excellent manipulation and read-out fidelities. We propose a scalable silicon-based qubit device that can be fabricated by industry-compatible processes. The device consists of a dense array of QDs localized along an etched silicon nano-ridge. Due to its lateral confinement, a simple dense array of metallic top-gates forms an array of QDs with controllable tunnel-couplings. To avoid potential fluctuations because of roughness and charged defects at the nano-ridge sidewall, the cross-section of the nano-ridge is trapezoidal and bounded by atomically-flat \{111\} facets. In addition to side-gates on top of the low-defect oxidized \{111\} facets, we implement a global back-gate facilitated by the use of silicon-on-insulator. The most relevant process modules are demonstrated experimentally including anisotropic wet-etching and local oxidation of the silicon nano-ridge, side-gate formation with chemical-mechanical polishing, and top-gate fabrication employing the spacer process. According to electrostatic simulations, our device concept allows forming capacitively-coupled QD double-arrays or adjacent charge detectors for spin-readout. Defining a logical qubit or realizing a single electron conveyor for mid-range qubit-coupling will be future applications.},

  abstract = {Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots are one of the promizing devices to realize a quantum processor. A better knowledge of the noise sources affecting the coherence of such a qubit is therefore of prime importance. In this work, we study the effect of telegraphic noise induced by the fluctuation of a single electric charge. We simulate as realistically as possible a hole spin qubit in a quantum dot defined electrostatically by a set of gates along a silicon nanowire channel. Calculations combining Poisson and time-dependent Schr\textbackslash "odinger equations allow to simulate the relaxation and the dephasing of the hole spin as a function of time for a classical random telegraph signal. We show that dephasing time \$T\_2\$ is well given by a two-level model in a wide range of frequency. Remarkably, in the most realistic configuration of a low frequency fluctuator, the system has a non-Gaussian behavior in which the phase coherence is lost as soon as the fluctuator has changed state. The Gaussian description becomes valid only beyond a threshold frequency \$\textbackslash omega\_\{th\}\$, when the two-level system reacts to the statistical distribution of the fluctuator states. We show that the dephasing time \$T\_\{2\}(\textbackslash omega\_\{th\})\$ at this threshold frequency can be considerably increased by playing on the orientation of the magnetic field and the gate potentials, by running the qubit along "sweet" lines. However, \$T\_\{2\}(\textbackslash omega\_\{th\})\$ remains bounded due to dephasing induced by the non-diagonal terms of the stochastic perturbation Hamiltonian. Our simulations reveal that the spin relaxation cannot be described cleanly in the two-level model because the coupling to higher energy hole levels impacts very strongly the spin decoherence. This result suggests that multi-level simulations including the coupling to phonons should be necessary to describe the relaxation phenomenon in this type of qubit.},

  abstract = {The spin of an electron confined in semiconductor quantum dots is currently a promising candidate for quantum bit (qubit) implementations. Taking advantage of existing CMOS integration technologies, such devices can offer a platform for large scale quantum computation. However, a quantum mechanical framework bridging a device's physical design and operational parameters to the qubit energy space is lacking. Furthermore, the spin to charge coupling introduced by intrinsic or induced Spin-Orbit-Interaction (SOI) exposes the qubits to charge noise compromising their coherence properties and inducing quantum gate errors. We present here a co-modelling framework for double quantum dot (DQD) devices and their charge noise environment. We use a combination of an electrostatic potential solver, full configuration interaction quantum mechanical methods and two-level-fluctuator models to study the quantum gate performance in realistic device designs and operation conditions. We utilize the developed models together alongside the single electron solutions of the quantum dots to simulate one- and two- qubit gates in the presence of charge noise. We find an inverse correlation between quantum gate errors and quantum dot confinement frequencies. We calculate X-gate fidelities {$>$}97\% in the simulated Si-MOS devices at a typical TLF densities. We also find that exchange driven two-qubit SWAP gates show higher sensitivity to charge noise with fidelities down to 91\% in the presence of the same density of TLFs. We further investigate the one- and two- qubit gate fidelities at different TLF densities. We find that given the small size of the quantum dots, sensitivity of a quantum gate to the distance between the noise sources and the quantum dot creates a strong variability in the quantum gate fidelities which can compromise the device yields in scaled qubit technologies.},

Three different types of DWP are distinguished, related to perfectly coordinated silica, intrinsic silica defects, and extrinsic defects. Their properties like the spatial extension and the dipole moment are characterized in detail. Furthermore, the absolute number of tunneling systems, i.e. symmetric DWP, is estimated.

Noise coupled from the environment is the main contributing factor to decoherence but can be mitigated via engineering design and control solutions. However, this is only possible after acquiring a thorough understanding of the dominant noise sources and their spectrum. In this paper, we employ a silicon quantum dot spin qubit as a metrological device to study the noise environment experienced by the qubit. We compare the sensitivity of this qubit to electrical noise with that of an implanted phosphorus donor in silicon qubit in the same environment and measurement set-up. Our results show that, as expected, a quantum dot spin qubit is more sensitive to electrical noise than a donor spin qubit due to the larger Stark shift, and the noise spectroscopy data shows pronounced charge noise contributions at intermediate frequencies (2-20 kHz).},

In this work, we measure the charge-noise spectrum of a Si/SiGe singlet-triplet qubit over more than 13 decades in frequency using a combination of methods, including dynamically-decoupled exchange oscillations with up to 512 \$\textbackslash pi\$ pulses during the qubit evolution. The charge noise is colored across the entire frequency range of our measurements, although the spectral exponent changes with frequency. Moreover, the charge-noise spectrum inferred from conductance measurements of a proximal sensor quantum dot agrees with that inferred from coherent oscillations of the singlet-triplet qubit, suggesting that simple transport measurements can accurately characterize the charge noise over a wide frequency range in Si/SiGe quantum dots.},

For metal films, mobility fluctuations associated with carrier-defect scattering lead to noise. In contrast, for most semiconductor devices, the noise usually results from fluctuations in the number of carriers due to charge exchange between the channel and defects, usually at or near a critical semiconductor/insulator interface. The Dutta-Horn model describes the noise with high precision in most cases. Insight into the physical mechanisms that lead to noise in microelectronic materials and devices has been obtained via total-ionizing-dose irradiation and/or thermal annealing, as illustrated with several examples. With the assistance of the Dutta-Horn model, measurements of the noise magnitude and temperature and/or voltage dependence of the noise enable estimates of the energy distributions of defects that lead to noise. The microstructure of several defects and/or impurities that cause noise in MOS devices (primarily O vacancies) and GaN/AlGaN HEMTs (e.g., hydrogenated impurity centers, N vacancies, and/or Fe centers) have been identified via experiments and density functional theory calculations.},

In the meanwhile, addressable single-spin and spin-spin manipulations in multiple-qubit systems will necessitate sizable spin-electric coupling. Given background charge fluctuation in nanostructures, however, its compatibility with enhanced coherence should be crucially questioned. Here we realise a single-electron spin qubit with isotopically-enriched phase coherence time (20 microseconds) and fast electrical control speed (up to 30 MHz) mediated by extrinsic spin-electric coupling. Using rapid spin rotations, we reveal that the free-evolution dephasing is caused by charge (instead of conventional magnetic) noise featured by a 1/f spectrum over seven decades of frequency. The qubit nevertheless exhibits superior performance with single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.9\% on average. Our work strongly suggests that designing artificial spin-electric coupling with account taken of charge noise is a promising route to large-scale spin-qubit systems having fault-tolerant controllability.},

Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires high-fidelity qubits. This has been achieved in various solid-state systems, including isotopically purified silicon, but is yet to be accomplished in industry-standard natural (unpurified) silicon, mainly as a result of the dephasing caused by residual nuclear spins. This high fidelity can be achieved by speeding up the qubit operation and/or prolonging the dephasing time, that is, increasing the Rabi oscillation quality factor Q (the Rabi oscillation decay time divided by the {$\pi$} rotation time). In isotopically purified silicon quantum dots, only the second approach has been used, leaving the qubit operation slow. We apply the first approach to demonstrate an addressable fault-tolerant qubit using a natural silicon double quantum dot with a micromagnet that is optimally designed for fast spin control. This optimized design allows access to Rabi frequencies up to 35 MHz, which is two orders of magnitude greater than that achieved in previous studies. We find the optimum Q = 140 in such high-frequency range at a Rabi frequency of 10 MHz. This leads to a qubit fidelity of 99.6\% measured via randomized benchmarking, which is the highest reported for natural silicon qubits and comparable to that obtained in isotopically purified silicon quantum dot\textendash based qubits. This result can inspire contributions to quantum computing from industrial communities.}

Zajac et al. built an efficient CNOT gate by using electron spin qubits in silicon quantum dots, an implementation that is especially appealing because of its compatibility with existing semiconductor-based electronics (see the Perspective by Schreiber and Bluhm). To showcase the potential, the authors used the gate to create an entangled quantum state called the Bell state. Science, this issue p. 439; see also p. 393 A two-qubit gate essential for quantum computing is demonstrated in silicon quantum dots. Single-qubit rotations and two-qubit CNOT operations are crucial ingredients for universal quantum computing. Although high-fidelity single-qubit operations have been achieved using the electron spin degree of freedom, realizing a robust CNOT gate has been challenging because of rapid nuclear spin dephasing and charge noise. We demonstrate an efficient resonantly driven CNOT gate for electron spins in silicon. Our platform achieves single-qubit rotations with fidelities greater than 99\%, as verified by randomized benchmarking. Gate control of the exchange coupling allows a quantum CNOT gate to be implemented with resonant driving in  200 nanoseconds. We used the CNOT gate to generate a Bell state with 78\% fidelity (corrected for errors in state preparation and measurement).

Shuttling the qubit carrying electrons between registers is a natural choice for high-fidelity coherent links provided the overhead of control signals stays moderate. Our proof-of-principle demonstrates shuttling of a single electron by a propagating wave-potential in an electrostatically defined 420\,nm long Si/SiGe quantum-channel. This conveyor-mode shuttling approach requires independent from its length only four sinusoidal control signals. We discuss the tuning of the signal parameters, detect the smoothness of the electron motion enabling the mapping of potential disorder and observe a high single-electron shuttling fidelity of 99.42\,{$\pm$}\,0.02\% including a reversal of direction. Our shuttling device can be readily embedded in industrial fabrication of Si/SiGe qubit chips and paves the way to solving the signal-fanout problem for a fully scalable semiconductor quantum-computing architecture.},

In this Review, we start by introducing the physics of holes in low-dimensional germanium structures, providing key insights from a theoretical perspective. We then examine the materials-science progress underpinning germanium-based planar heterostructures and nanowires. We go on to review the most significant experimental results demonstrating key building blocks for quantum technology, such as an electrically driven universal quantum gate set with spin qubits in quantum dots and superconductor\textendash semiconductor devices for hybrid quantum systems. We conclude by identifying the most promising avenues towards scalable quantum information processing in germanium-based systems.}

Current approaches in solid-state quantum technology are based on brute-force methods, where each and every qubit requires at least one unique control line, an approach that will become unsustainable when scaling to the required millions of qubits. Here, inspired by random access architectures in classical electronics, we introduce the shared control of semiconductor quantum dots to efficiently operate a two-dimensional crossbar array in planar germanium. We tune the entire array, comprising 16 quantum dots, to the few-hole regime and, to isolate an unpaired spin per dot, we confine an odd number of holes in each site. Moving forward, we establish a method for the selective control of the quantum dots interdot coupling and achieve a tunnel coupling tunability over more than 10 GHz. The operation of a quantum electronic device with fewer control terminals than tunable experimental parameters represents a compelling step forward in the construction of scalable quantum technology.},

  abstract = {Rapid progress in semiconductor spin qubits has enabled experimental demonstrations of a two-qubit logic gate. Understanding spin decoherence in a two-qubit logic gate is necessary for optimal qubit operation. We study spin decoherence due to 1/f charge noise for two electrons in a double quantum dot used for a two-qubit controlled-phase gate. In contrast to the usual belief, spin decoherence can be dominated by the tunneling noise from 1/f charge noise instead of the detuning noise. Tunneling noise can dominate because the effect of tunneling noise on the spin qubit is first order in the charge admixture; while the effect of the detuning noise is only second order. The different orders of contributions result in different detuning dependence of the decoherence, which provides a way to identify the noise source. We find that decoherence in a recent two-qubit experiment was dominated by the tunneling noise from 1/f charge noise. The results illustrate the importance of considering tunneling noise to design optimal operation of spin qubits.}

abstract = {Abstract Electron spins in silicon offer a competitive, scalable quantum-computing platform with excellent single-qubit properties. However, the two-qubit gate fidelities achieved so far have fallen short of the 99\% threshold required for large-scale error-corrected quantum computing architectures. In the past few years, there has been a growing realization that the critical obstacle in meeting this threshold in semiconductor qubits is charge noise arising from the qubit environment. In this work, a notably low level of charge noise of S0 = 0.0088 ± 0.0004 μeV2 Hz−1 is demonstrated using atom qubits in crystalline silicon, achieved by separating the qubits from surfaces and interface states. The charge noise is measured using both a single electron transistor and an exchange-coupled qubit pair that collectively provide a consistent charge noise spectrum over four frequency decades, with the noise level S0 being an order of magnitude lower than previously reported. Low-frequency detuning noise, set by the total measurement time, is shown to be the dominant dephasing source of two-qubit exchange oscillations. With recent advances in fast (≈μs) single-shot readout, it is shown that by reducing the total measurement time to ≈1 s, 99.99\% two-qubit SWAP gate fidelities can be achieved in single-crystal atom qubits in silicon.},

abstract={Full-scale quantum computers require the integration of millions of qubits, and the potential of using industrial semiconductor manufacturing to meet this need has driven the development of quantum computing in silicon quantum dots. However, fabrication has so far relied on electron-beam lithography and, with a few exceptions, conventional lift-off processes that suffer from low yield and poor uniformity. Here we report quantum dots that are hosted at a 28Si/28SiO2 interface and fabricated in a 300{\thinspace}mm semiconductor manufacturing facility using all-optical lithography and fully industrial processing. With this approach, we achieve nanoscale gate patterns with excellent yield. In the multi-electron regime, the quantum dots allow good tunnel barrier control---a crucial feature for fault-tolerant two-qubit gates. Single-spin qubit operation using magnetic resonance in the few-electron regime reveals relaxation times of over 1{\thinspace}s at 1{\thinspace}T and coherence times of over 3{\thinspace}ms.},

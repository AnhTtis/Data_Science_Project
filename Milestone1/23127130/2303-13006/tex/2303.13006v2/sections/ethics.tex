\section{Ethical concerns} \label{sec:ethics}

All individuals portrayed in this paper provided informed consent to use their images as test images. This was not possible for the images from the FFHQ~\cite{stylegan}, LFW~\cite{lfw}, AgeDB-30~\cite{agedb}, and CFP-FP~\cite{cfpfp} data sets. Therefore, we do not show them in the paper and cannot provide qualitative comparisons to Vec2Face~\cite{vec2face} (code not available).


We recognize the potential for misuse of any method that creates realistic imagery of human beings, especially when the images are made to correspond to specific individuals.  We condemn such misuse and support ongoing research into the identification of artificially manipulated data.

	abstract = {Soft robot arms remain challenging to model effectively. The arm’s primary deformation is bending, coupled with extension or compression, but the strains experienced can be high, the materials are generally nonlinear, and the deformations are large. Existing work has focused on models intended to improve control, which rely on post-manufacturing empirical characterization of each arm design. This article presents a quasi-static model based on Euler–Bernoulli beam theory that generalizes across a broad set of arm designs. The model is implemented for fluid-driven soft arms constructed with {McKibben} actuators. Actuators are treated as active materials, and their force is characterized as a nonlinear function of pressure and uniaxial strain. The model is validated for multiple soft arms under external loads, and further use is demonstrated through an investigation of the soft arms’ loaded workspace. Higher load capacities are shown to be concentrated at the arms’ midlines. Distal taper is examined in an example arm design, and is shown to improve range of motion and load resistance when compared to a constant width arm. The model can be used to evaluate variations on the number and arrangement of actuators in an arm, and it is proposed as a first order design and analysis method for soft robot arms.},

	abstract = {Frictional anisotropy, as produced by the directionality of scales in snake skin, is necessary to propel snakes across flat, hard surfaces. This work illustrates the design, fabrication, and testing of a snake-inspired skin based on kirigami techniques that, when attached to a soft snake robot, improves the robot's locomotion capabilities when implementing a lateral undulation gait. Examination of snake scales in nature informed the shape and texture of the synthetic scales, which are activated through the buckling of kirigami lattices. Biological snakes have microornamentation on their scales, which is replicated by scoring ridges into the plastic skin. This microornamentation contributes to the lateral resistance necessary for lateral undulation. The skin's frictional properties were experimentally determined, as were their contributions to the locomotion of the robot across a flat, hard, textured surface. Contributions to locomotion from scale profile geometry, scale microornamentation, and scale angle of attack were identified. The range of longitudinal {COF} ratios was 1.0 to 3.0 and the range of lateral {COF} ratios was 0.9 to 3.3. The highest performing skin was the triangular scale profile with microornamentation, producing a velocity of 6 mm/s (0.03 {BL}/s) which is an increase of 335\% over the robot with no skin when activated to maximum achievable curvature.},

	abstract = {Current models of bending in soft arms are formulated in terms of experimentally determined, arm-specific parameters, which cannot evaluate fundamental differences in soft robot arm design. Existing models are successful at improving control of individual arms but do not give insight into how the structure of the arm affects the arm’s capabilities. For example, omnidirectional soft robot arms most frequently have three parallel actuators, but may have four or more, while common biological arms, including octopuses, have tens of distinct longitudinal muscle bundles. This article presents a quasi-static analytical model of soft arms bent with longitudinal actuators, based on equilibrium principles and assuming an unknown neutral axis location. The model is presented as a generalizable framework and specifically implemented for an arm with N fluid-driven actuators, a subset of which are pressurized to induce a bend with a certain curvature and direction. The presented implementation is validated experimentally using planar (2D) and spatial (3D) bends. The planar model is used to initially estimate pressure for a closed-loop curvature control system and to bound the accessible configurations for a rapidly-exploring random trees ({RRT}) motion planner. A three-segment planar arm is demonstrated to navigate along a planned trajectory through a gap in a wall. Finally, the model is used to explore how the arm morphology affects maximum curvature and directional resolution. This research analytically connects soft arm structure and actuator behavior to unloaded arm performance, and the results may be used to methodically design soft robot arms.},

They are often controlled with gaits, coordinated cyclic patterns of joint motion. Using gaits simpliﬁes the design of high-level controllers, but shifts the complexity burden to designing the gaits. In this paper, we address the gait design problem by introducing two algorithms: Annealed chain ﬁtting and Keyframe wave extraction. Annealed chain ﬁtting efﬁciently maps a continuous backbone curve describing the three-dimensional shape of the robot to a set of joint angles for a snake robot. Keyframe wave extraction takes joint angles ﬁt to a sequence of backbone curves and identiﬁes parameterized periodic functions that produce those sequences. We validate the algorithms by using them to produce rolling and sidewinding gaits for crawling and climbing, with results that match previous empirical investigations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel circumferential pneumatic actuator to be used as an antagonist in soft bending arms. The design is based on a {McKibben} actuator, and the circular shape is inspired by octopus musculature. The performance of the presented actuator is evaluated through characterization of individual actuators, as well as experimental analysis of the actuator’s effect on the behavior of an existing soft bending arm segment. A stack of 16 circumferential actuators is capable of producing a force of 37 N when pressurized to 32 {kPa} and deﬂected to -15\% strain. When the actuators are integrated into a 75 mm diameter soft arm, the arm is able to successfully lift 600 g (285\% of its own mass) to 54\% of the arm’s original height, which is 2.2 times the maximum load for the arm without antagonistic actuators. When the soft arm with antagonistic actuators lifted 250 g at 40 {kPa}, the segment returned to 101\% of its original height, compared to 59\% for the arm segment without antagonistic actuators. Compared to existing antagonistic systems, this circumferential actuator produces high extension strokes and high forces at pressures below 100 {kPa}. The presented actuator is simple to manufacture and the design is complementary to the geometry of many soft arms, which makes the actuator a suitable choice to improve the arms’ maximum load.},

	abstract = {Soft robots are compliant and durable, and thus potentially better-suited for swimming or crawling over rough terrain than conventional rigid robots. Biomimetic locomotion strategies are often implemented on soft robots, but are difﬁcult to tune because of the complexity of mapping nonlinear mechanical systems to speciﬁc gait patterns. We propose an approach to soft robot control in which the robot is designed to physically realize a shape space (mechanically predeﬁned body poses) to follow a theoretically optimal gait. Speciﬁcally in this paper we present an entirely soft snake robot designed to implement the prerequisite shape space for slithering gaits. When coupled with a geometric mechanics model relating serpentine shape sequences to displacement, appropriate gait patterns can be selected analytically based on the system’s Lie bracket. We developed a modular, two-link soft robot and used the geometric mechanics model to identify several cyclic gait patterns for producing forward displacement. The gait patterns were tested on the soft robot and observed with a motion capture system to measure displacement and monitor shape sequences. Relative performance of the gait patterns is consistent with the geometric “soap-bubble method” as a heuristic for gait optimization, which demonstrates the applicability of this approach to soft robot control and coordination.},

Soft robotic snakes ({SRS}) with their continuous and smooth bending capability better mimic their biological counterparts’ unique characteristics. Prior {SRSs} are limited to planar operation with a limited number of planar gaits. We propose a novel {SRS} with spatial bending and investigate snake locomotion gaits beyond the capabilities of the state-of-the-art systems. We derive a complete ﬂoating-base kinematic model of the robot and use the model to derive jointspace trajectories for serpentine and inward/outward rolling locomotion gaits. The locomotion gaits for the proposed {SRS} are experimentally validated under varying frequency and amplitude of gait cycles. The results qualitatively and quantitatively validate the {SRS} ability to leverage spatial bending to achieve locomotion gaits not possible with current {SRS}.},

	abstract = {Limbless organisms such as snakes can navigate nearly all terrain. In particular, desert-dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) operate effectively on inclined granular media (such as sand dunes) that induce failure in field-tested limbless robots through slipping and pitching. Our laboratory experiments reveal that as granular incline angle increases, sidewinder rattlesnakes increase the length of their body in contact with the sand. Implementing this strategy in a physical robot model of the snake enables the device to ascend sandy slopes close to the angle of maximum slope stability. Plate drag experiments demonstrate that granular yield stresses decrease with increasing incline angle. Together, these three approaches demonstrate how sidewinding with contact-length control mitigates failure on granular media.Crossing a slope can be difficult, particularly if it is made of sand. Sidewinder rattlesnakes manage to climb sandy hills by adjusting the length of their body in contact with the sand. Marvi et al. designed robots based on this idea to determine what affects climbing ability on sandy slopes (see the Perspective by Socha). Based on the behavior of the robots, the authors performed further animal studies, and used an iterative approach to improve the robots' capabilities and to better understand animal motion.Science, this issue p. 224; see also p. 160},

This pattern of movement is found in fungal hyphae, developing neurons, and trailing plants, and is characterized by extension from the tip of the body, length change of hundreds of percent, and active control of growth direction. This results in the abilities to move through tightly constrained environments and form useful three-dimensional structures from the body. We report a class of soft pneumatic robot that is capable of a basic form of this behavior, growing substantially in length from the tip while actively controlling direction using onboard sensing of environmental stimuli; further, the peak rate of lengthening is comparable to rates of animal and robot locomotion. This is enabled by two principles: Pressurization of an inverted thin-walled vessel allows rapid and substantial lengthening of the tip of the robot body, and controlled asymmetric lengthening of the tip allows directional control. Further, we demonstrate the abilities to lengthen through constrained environments by exploiting passive deformations and form three-dimensional structures by lengthening the body of the robot along a path. Our study helps lay the foundation for engineered systems that grow to navigate the environment.},

The soft arm comprises three contractile and one extensor {PAMs}, which can vary its stiffness independently of its position in space. Force analysis for the soft arm is conducted, and stiffness model of the arm is established based on the relational model of contractile and extensor {PAM}. The accuracy of stiffness model for the soft arm was verified through experiments. Associated to this, a controller based on the fuzzy adaptive theory and active disturbance rejection control ({ADRC}), {FADRC}, has been designed to control the arm. The fuzzy adaptive theory is used to adjust the parameters of the {ADRC}, the control algorithm has the ability to control stiffness and position of the soft arm.

	abstract = {Snake robots, sometimes called hyper-redundant mechanisms, can use their many degrees of freedom to achieve a variety of locomotive capabilities. These capabilities are ideally suited for disaster response because the snake robot can thread through tightly packed volumes, accessing locations that people and conventional machinery otherwise cannot. Snake robots also have the advantage of possessing a variety of locomotion capabilities that conventional robots do not. Just like their biological counterparts, snake robots achieve these locomotion capabilities using cyclic motions called gaits. These cyclic motions directly control the snake robot’s internal degrees of freedom which, in turn, causes a net motion, say forward, lateral and rotational, for the snake robot. The gaits described in this paper fall into two categories: parameterized and scripted. The parameterized gaits, as their name suggests, can be described by a relative simple parameterized function, whereas the scripted cannot. This paper describes the functions we prescribed for gait generation and our experiences in making these robots operate in real experiments.},

	abstract = {The establishment of a new academic field is often characterized by a phase of rapid growth, as seen over the last decade in the field of soft robotics. However, such growth can be followed by an equally rapid decline if concerted efforts are not made by the community. Here, we argue that for soft robotics to take root and have impact in the next decade, we must move beyond “soft for soft’s sake” and ensure that each study makes a meaningful contribution to the field and, ideally, to robotics and engineering more broadly. We present a three-tiered categorization to help researchers and reviewers evaluate work and guide studies toward higher levels of contribution. We ground this categorization with historical examples of soft solutions outside of robotics that were transformative. We believe that the proposed self-reflection is essential if soft robotics is to be an impactful field in the next decade, advancing robotics and engineering both within and beyond academia and creating soft solutions that are quantitatively superior to the current state of the art—soft, rigid, or otherwise.},

	abstract = {The McKibben artificial muscle is a pneumatic device characterized by its high level of functional analogy with human skeletal muscle. While maintaining a globally cylindrical shape, the McKibben muscle produces a contraction force decreasing with its contraction ratio, as does skeletal muscle. The maximum force-to-weight ratio can be surprisingly high for a limited radial dimension and for a conventional pressure range. A 50 g McKibben muscle can easily develop more than 1000 N under 5 bar pressure for an external radius varying from about 1.5 to 3 cm. Thus, robotics specialists are interested in this well-adapted artificial muscle for motorizing powerful yet compact robot arms. The basic McKibben muscle static modeling developed in the paper, which is based on the three main parameters (i.e., initial braid angle, initial muscle length, and initial muscle radius) and includes a three-parameter friction model of the thread against itself, has shown its efficiency in both isometric and isotonic contraction.},

To mimic this aerial prowess in a similarly sized robot requires tiny, high-efficiency mechanical components that pose miniaturization challenges governed by force-scaling laws, suggesting unconventional solutions for propulsion, actuation, and manufacturing. To this end, we developed high-power-density piezoelectric flight muscles and a manufacturing methodology capable of rapidly prototyping articulated, flexure-based sub-millimeter mechanisms. We built an 80-milligram, insect-scale, flapping-wing robot modeled loosely on the morphology of flies. Using a modular approach to flight control that relies on limited information about the robot's dynamics, we demonstrated tethered but unconstrained stable hovering and basic controlled flight maneuvers. The result validates a sufficient suite of innovations for achieving artificial, insect-like flight.},

	abstract = {Soft robotics offers the unique promise of creating inherently safe and adaptive systems. These systems bring man-made machines closer to the natural capabilities of biological systems. An important requirement to enable self-contained soft mobile robots is an on-board power source. In this paper, we present an approach to create a bio-inspired soft robotic snake that can undulate in a similar way to its biological counterpart using pressure for actuation power, without human intervention. With this approach, we develop an autonomous soft snake robot with on-board actuation, power, computation and control capabilities. The robot consists of four bidirectional fluidic elastomer actuators in series to create a traveling curvature wave from head to tail along its body. Passive wheels between segments generate the necessary frictional anisotropy for forward locomotion. It takes 14 h to build the soft robotic snake, which can attain an average locomotion speed of 19 mm s−1.},

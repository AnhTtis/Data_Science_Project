    "abstract": "In 1935, Erdős proved the sums $f_k=\\sum_n 1/(n\\log n)$, over integers $n$ with exactly $k$ prime factors, are uniformly bounded, and in 1993 Zhang proved $f_k$ is maximized by the prime sum $f_1=\\sum_p 1/(p\\log p)$. According to a 2013 conjecture of Banks and Martin, the sums $f_k$ are predicted to decrease monotonically in $k$. In this article, we show the sums restricted to odd integers are indeed monotonically decreasing in $k$, sufficiently large. By contrast, contrary to the conjecture we prove the sums $f_k$ increase monotonically in $k$, sufficiently large.\n  Our main result gives an asymptotic for $f_k$ which identifies the (negative) secondary term, i.e. $f_k = 1 - (a+o(1))k^2/2^k$ for an explicit constant $a= .0656\\cdots$. This is proven by a refined method combining real and complex analysis, while the classical results of Sathe and Selberg on products of $k$ primes imply the weaker estimate $f_k=1+O_{\\varepsilon}(k^{\\varepsilon-1/2})$. We also give an alternate, probability-theoretic argument related to the Dickman distribution. Here the proof reduces to showing a new sequence of integrals converges to $e^{-γ}$, which may be of independent interest.",

% \GMTODO{Other AllSAT applications (from~\citeR{morgadoGoodLearningImplicit2005,todaImplementingEfficientAll2016,zhangAcceleratingAllSATComputation2020}): in data mining (e.g., frequent itemsets), network verification, image and preimage computation in unbounded Model Checking. AllSMT: predicate abstraction, in probabilistic reasoning (e.g., \#SMT, WMI).}
\paragraph{Applications of AllSAT and AllSMT.}
SAT and \smt{} enumeration has an important role in a variety of applications, ranging from artificial intelligence to formal verification.
AllSAT and AllSMT, mainly in their disjoint version, play a foundational role in several frameworks for \emph{probabilistic reasoning}, such as model counting in \smt{}~(\emph{\#\smt})~\cite{chistikovApproximateCountingSMT2017}
and \emph{Weighted Model Integration (WMI)}~\cite{belleProbabilisticInferenceHybrid2015,morettin-wmi-ijcar17,morettin-wmi-aij19,spallitta_smt-based_2022,spallittaEnhancingSMTbasedWeighted2024a}.
Specifically, \#\smtlarat{}~\cite{maVolumeComputationBoolean2009,zhouEstimatingVolumeSolution2015,geComputingEstimatingVolume2018} consists in summing up the volumes of the convex polytopes defined by each of the \larat{}-satisfiable truth assignments propositionally satisfying a \smtlarat{} formula, and has been employed for value estimation of probabilistic programs~\cite{chistikovApproximateCountingSMT2017} and for quantitative program analysis~\cite{liuProgramAnalysisQualitative2011}.\@ WMI can be seen as a generalization of \#\smtlarat{} that additionally considers a weight function $w$ that has to be integrated over each of such polytopes, and has been used to perform inference in hybrid probabilistic models such as Bayesian and Markov networks~\cite{belleProbabilisticInferenceHybrid2015} and Density Estimation Trees~\cite{spallitta_smt-based_2022}.
%Hence, in these cases, it is essential to enumerate disjoint partial truth assignments that are as small and as few as possible.
%
%
AllSAT has applications also in \emph{data mining}, where the problem of frequent itemsets can be encoded into a propositional formula whose satisfying assignments are the frequent itemsets~\cite{boudaneSATbasedApproachMining2016,dlalaComparativeStudySATBased2016}.
%Specifically, in \#SMT(\larat) consists in summing up the volumes of the convex polytopes defined by each of the assignments, whereas in WMI some function $w$ has to be integrated over each of such polytopes. %Hence, in these cases, it is essential to enumerate disjoint partial \ignoreinlong{models}\ignoreinshort{\GMCHANGE{truth assignments}} that are as small and as few as possible.
% In the context of knowledge compilation (cite), AllSAT can be used to compile a formula into deterministic Decomposable Normal Form (d-DNNF) (cite), that has found applications, e.g., in planning (cite). 
It has also been used in the context of \emph{software testing} to generate a suite of test inputs that should match a given output~\cite{khurshidCaseEfficientSolution2004}, and in \emph{circuit design}, to convert a formula from CNF to DNF~\cite{minatoFindingAllSimple1998,miltersenConvertingCNFDNF2005,bernasconiCompactDSOPPartial2013},
and for Static Timing Analysis to determine the inputs that can trigger a timing violation in a circuit~\cite{friedAllSATCombinationalCircuits2023}.
AllSAT and AllSMT have been applied also in \emph{network verification} for checking network reachability and for analysing the correctness and consistency of network connectivity policies~\cite{lopes2013network,jayaraman2014automated,lopesCheckingBeliefsDynamic2015}.
Moreover, they have been used for computing the image and preimage of a given set of states in \emph{unbounded model checking}~\cite{mcmillanApplyingSATMethods2002b,grumbergMemoryEfficientAllSolutions2004,liNovelSATAllsolutions2004}, and they are also at the core of algorithms for computing \emph{predicate abstraction}, a concept widely used in formal verification for automatically computing finite-state abstractions for systems with potentially infinite state space~\cite{lahiriSymbolicApproachPredicate2003,clarkePredicateAbstractionANSIC2004,hutchison_smt_2006}.

\paragraph{AllSAT.}
Most of the works on AllSAT have focused on the enumeration of satisfying assignments for CNF formulas (e.g.,~\citeR{morgadoGoodLearningImplicit2005,huangUsingDPLLEfficient2005,yu_all-sat_2014,todaBDDConstructionAll2015,todaImplementingEfficientAll2016,liangAllSATCCBoostingAllSAT2022,spallittaDisjointPartialEnumeration2024}), with several efforts in developing efficient and effective techniques for minimizing partial assignments (e.g.,~\citeR{raviMinimalAssignmentsBounded2004,morgadoGoodLearningImplicit2005,todaImplementingEfficientAll2016}).
The problem of minimizing truth assignments for Tseitin-encoded problems was addressed by~\citeA{hutchison_minimizing_2013}. They propose to
%first simplify the formula by considering its original structure and the current model; then they 
make iterative calls to a SAT solver imposing increasingly tighter cardinality constraints to obtain a minimal assignment. Whereas this approach can be used to find a single short truth assignment, it can be very expensive, and thus it is unsuitable for enumeration.

Other works have concentrated on the enumeration of satisfying assignments for combinatorial circuits, exploiting the structural information of the circuits to minimize the partial assignments over the input variables (e.g.,~\citeR{jinEfficientConflictAnalysis2005,jin2005prime,tibebu_augmenting_2018,friedAllSATCombinationalCircuits2023}).

A problem closely-related to AllSAT is that of finding all the prime implicants of a formula (e.g.,~\citeR{previtiPrimeCompilationNonClausal,jabbourEnumeratingPrimeImplicants2014a,luoEfficientTwophaseMethod2021}). AllSAT is a much simpler problem, and can be viewed as the problem of finding a not-necessarily-prime implicant cover for the formula.

\paragraph{Projected AllSAT.}
Projected enumeration, i.e., enumeration of satisfying assignments over a set of relevant atoms, has been studied mainly for CNF formulas, e.g., by~\citeA{grumbergMemoryEfficientAllSolutions2004,liNovelSATAllsolutions2004,hutchison_smt_2006,todaExploitingFunctionalDependencies2017}. The ambiguity of the notion of ``satisfiability by partial assignment'' for non-CNF and existentially-quantified formulas has been raised by~\citeA{sebastiani_are_2020,mohle_four_2020}, highlighting the difference between ``evaluation to true'', which is simpler to check and typically used by SAT solvers, and ``logical entailment'', %\GMCHANGEp{, 
which allows for producing shorter assignments. %}. 
The approach based on dual reasoning by \citeA{mohleDualizingProjectedModel2018,mohleEnumeratingShortProjected2021}, although able to detect logical entailment and thus to produce shorter partial assignments, is very inefficient even for small formulas.


\paragraph{AllSMT.}
The literature on AllSMT is very limited, and AllSMT algorithms are highly based on AllSAT techniques and tools. E.g., \mathsatfive{}~\cite{mathsat5_tacas13} implements an AllSMT functionality based on the procedure by~\citeA{hutchison_smt_2006}. A similar procedure has been described and implemented by~\citeA{phanAllSolutionSatisfiabilityModulo2015f}.

\paragraph{The role of CNF encodings.}
Although most AllSAT solvers assume the formulas to be in CNF, little or no work has been done to investigate the impact of the different CNF encodings on their effectiveness and efficiency. The role of the CNF-ization has been widely studied for SAT solving (e.g.,~\citeR{boy_de_la_tour_optimality_1992,jacksonClauseFormConversions2005,bjork_successful_2009,kuiter_tseitin_2022}) and in a recent work also for propositional model counting in the context of feature model analysis~\cite{kuiter_tseitin_2022}.

\subparagraph{Dual-rail encoding.}%
\label{sec:dualrail}
The idea of using two different variables to represent the positive and negative occurrences of a sub-formula shares some similarities with the so-called \emph{dual-rail} encoding~\cite{bryantCOSMOSCompiledSimulator1987,palopoliAlgorithmsSelectiveEnumeration1999}, which has been shown to be successful for prime implicant enumeration~\cite{%palopoliAlgorithmsSelectiveEnumeration1999,
    previtiPrimeCompilationNonClausal,luoEfficientTwophaseMethod2021}, and recently also for SAT enumeration for combinatorial circuits~\cite{friedAllSATCombinationalCircuits2023}.

Given a CNF formula, the dual-rail encoding maps each atom $A_i$ into a pair of dual-rail atoms $\pair{\poslab{A_i}}{\neglab{A_i}}$, so that $A_i$ and $\neg{}A_i$ are substituted with $\poslab{A_i}$ and $\neglab{A_i}$, respectively, and the clause $(\neg\poslab{A_i}\vee\neg\neglab{A_i})$ is conjoined with the formula. The resulting CNF formula is equisatisfiable to the original one, and every total assignment $\eta$ satisfying the dual-rail encoding corresponds to a partial assignment $\mu$ satisfying the original formula. Such $\mu$ can be obtained by assigning $\mu(A_i)$ to $\top$ or $\bot$ if the pair $\pair{\eta(\poslab{A_i})}{\eta(\neglab{A_i})}$ is $\pair{\top}{\bot}$ or $\pair{\bot}{\top}$, respectively, while leaving it unassigned if $\pair{\eta(\poslab{A_i})}{\eta(\neglab{A_i})}=\pair{\bot}{\bot}$. Short partial assignments can be obtained by maximizing the number of pairs assigned to $\pair{\bot}{\bot}$, which can be done either exactly by solving a MaxSAT problem or approximately by assigning negative value first in decision branches~\cite{friedAllSATCombinationalCircuits2023}.

% \begin{gmchangep}

Using the dual-rail encoding for enumeration, however, requires ad-hoc enumeration algorithms, since the solver must take into account the three-valued semantics of truth assignments over dual-rail atoms when enumerating the assignments~\cite{friedAllSATCombinationalCircuits2023}.
Our contribution, instead, focuses on CNF-ization approaches, which can be used in combination with any enumeration algorithm matching the properties described in~\sref{sec:background:allsat}.
%
Also, comparing the $\NNFna{}+\PlaistedCNF{}$ encoding with the dual-rail encoding, we observe that the former duplicates only the label atoms in $\allB{}$, so that the number of introduced atoms is smaller than in the dual-rail encoding.
Moreover, because of this, the clauses in the form $(\neg\poslab{B_i}\vee\neg\neglab{B_i})$ are not needed for correctness but only for efficiency, and can in principle be omitted. In the dual-rail encoding, instead, their presence is essential to prevent the illegal assignment $\eta(\poslab{B_i})=\eta(\neglab{B_i})=\top$.

% \end{gmchangep}


% Also, differently from the approach by~\citeA{friedAllSATCombinationalCircuits2023}, our approach does not require implementing ad-hoc enumeration algorithms, and any enumeration strategy matching conditions~\ref{item:mumodelsvi}-\ref{item:muAminimal} in \sref{sec:background:allsat} can benefit from it.
%
% A technique that has gained some success in SAT enumeration is the so called dual-rail encoding~\cite{bryantCOSMOSCompiledSimulator1987%,palopoliAlgorithmsSelectiveEnumeration1999
% }. E.g.,~\citeA{friedAllSATCombinationalCircuits2023} exploit it to enumerate short partial assignments for circuits, and also~\citeA{%palopoliAlgorithmsSelectiveEnumeration1999,
%     previtiPrimeCompilationNonClausal,luoEfficientTwophaseMethod2021} use it in the context of prime implicants enumeration. %We highlight the main similarities and differences of this encoding with the encoding proposed in this paper in~\sref{sec:dualrail}.

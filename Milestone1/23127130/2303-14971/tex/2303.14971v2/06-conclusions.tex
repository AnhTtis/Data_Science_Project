We have presented a theoretical and empirical analysis of the impact of different CNF-ization approaches on SAT enumeration. We have shown how the most popular transformations conceived for SAT solving, namely the Tseitin and the Plaisted\&Greenbaum CNF-izations, prevent the solver from producing short partial assignments, thus seriously affecting the effectiveness of the enumeration. To overcome this limitation, we have proposed to preprocess the formula by converting it into NNF before applying the Plaisted\&Greenbaum transformation. We have shown, both theoretically and empirically, that the latter approach can fully overcome the problem and can drastically reduce both the number of partial assignments and the execution time. 

As future research directions, we plan to further investigate the
impact of CNF conversion also on disjoint SMT enumeration. We expect that in
this domain the impact can be even more relevant, since in SMT
multiple instances of the same theory atoms are typically rarer than for atoms in
the Boolean case. Also, disjoint SMT enumeration has a fundamental role in Weighted Model Integration~\cite{morettin-wmi-ijcar17,morettin-wmi-aij19,spallitta_smt-based_2022}, an important framework for probabilistic inference in hybrid domains. Hence, we believe that our contribution can have a great impact on this application, where non-CNF formulas occur frequently.
Finally, we think that work should be done to understand the impact on enumeration with repetitions, i.e.\ where models may not be disjoint, for instance in Predicate Abstraction~\cite{hutchison_smt_2006}. %Moreover, there is an alternative definition of partial assignment satisfiability that is based on the notion of \emph{entailment}~\cite{sebastiani_are_2020,mohle_four_2020}. Understanding the impact of the CNF conversion on solvers that use this definition is an interesting direction.

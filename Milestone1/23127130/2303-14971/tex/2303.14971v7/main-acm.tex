%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography

%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include
%% support for advanced citation of software artefact from the
%% biblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.
%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and

%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  Modern SAT and SMT solvers are designed to handle problems expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) so that non-CNF problems must be CNF-ized upfront, typically by using variants of either Tseitin or Plaisted and Greenbaum transformations.
  %
  When passing from plain solving to enumeration, however, the capability of
  producing partial satisfying assignments that are as small as possible becomes
  crucial, which raises the question of whether such CNF encodings are also
  effective for enumeration.

  In this paper, we investigate both theoretically and empirically the
  effectiveness of CNF conversions for SAT and SMT enumeration. On the negative
  side, we show that: (i)~Tseitin transformation prevents the solver from
  producing short partial assignments, thus seriously affecting the effectiveness
  of enumeration; (ii)~Plaisted and Greenbaum transformation overcomes this
  problem only in part. On the positive side, we prove theoretically and we show
  empirically that combining Plaisted and Greenbaum transformation with NNF
  preprocessing upfront \mbox{---which} is typically not used in solving--- can
  fully overcome the problem and can drastically reduce both the number of
  partial assignments and the execution time.

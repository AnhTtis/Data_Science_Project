\begin{abstract}
Modern SAT solvers are designed to handle problems expressed in
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) so that non-CNF problems must be
CNF-ized upfront, typically by using variants of either Tseitin
  or Plaisted and Greenbaum transformations.
%converted into CNF upfront.
% \ignore{The Tseitin transformation is a widely used procedure for this conversion, since it generates an equisatisfiable formula without causing an exponential increase in the number of clauses\ignoreinshort{, by introducing fresh Boolean atoms to label sub-formulas}.
% This transformation can be employed also for SAT enumeration (AllSAT) by projecting the enumeration on original variables only.}
When passing from solving to enumeration, however, the capability of
producing partial satisfying assignments that are as small as
possible becomes crucial, which raises the question of whether such CNF encodings are also effective for enumeration.


In this paper, we investigate both theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of CNF conversions for {disjoint} SAT enumeration. 
On the negative side, we show that: 
(i) Tseitin transformation prevents the solver from producing short partial assignments, thus seriously affecting the effectiveness of enumeration;
(ii) Plaisted and Greenbaum transformation  overcomes this problem only in part.
On the positive side, we show that  combining  Plaisted and Greenbaum
transformation with NNF preprocessing upfront
---which is typically not used in solving---
can % mia aggiunta
fully overcome the problem and can drastically %significantly
reduce both the number of partial assignments and the execution time.
\ignore{This analysis is validated by an experimental
evaluation on non-CNF problems originating from both synthetic and real-world-inspired applications.}

%First, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that the Tseitin encoding prevents the solver from producing short partial assignments. Second, we show that the CNF transformation by Plaisted and Greenbaum can overcome this limitation, especially when the formula is first converted into Negation Normal Form, although these techniques are typically not adopted for SAT solving.
%This analysis is validated by an experimental evaluation on non-CNF problems originating from both synthetic and real-world-inspired applications. 
%We preprocessed each formula using  different CNF transformations, and measured the number of partial assignments and the execution times for each transformation. 
%Our findings indicate that combining NNF and the Plaisted-Greenbaum CNF transformation can significantly reduce both the number of partial assignments and the execxution time compared to using the Tseitin encoding.

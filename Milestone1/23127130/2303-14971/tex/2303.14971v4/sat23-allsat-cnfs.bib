	abstract = {Modern SAT solvers are designed to handle problems expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) so that non-CNF problems must be CNF-ized upfront, typically by using variants of either Tseitin or Plaisted\&Greenbaum transformations. When passing from solving to enumeration, however, the capability of producing partial satisfying assignment that are as small as possible becomes crucial, which raises the question of whether such CNF encodings are also effective for enumeration. In this paper, we investigate both theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of CNF conversions for SAT enumeration. On the negative side, we show that: (i) Tseitin transformation prevents the solver from producing short partial assignments, thus seriously affecting the effectiveness of enumeration; (ii) Plaisted\&Greenbaum transformation overcomes this problem only in part. On the positive side, we show that combining Plaisted\&Greenbaum transformation with NNF preprocessing upfront -- which is typically not used in solving -- can fully overcome the problem and can drastically reduce both the number of partial assignments and the execution time.},

Using various forms of dual reasoning allows our CDCL-based algorithm to enumerate partial models with no need for exploring and shrinking full models. Our focus is on model enumeration without repetition, with potential applications in weighted model counting and weighted model integration for probabilistic inference over Boolean and hybrid domains. Chronological backtracking renders the use of blocking clauses obsolete. We provide a formalization and examples. We further discuss important design choices for a future implementation related to the strength of dual reasoning, including unit propagation, using SAT or QBF oracles.},

The conventional translation of a first-order formula into clause form often obscures the structure of the formula, and may increase the length of the formula by an exponential amount in the worst case. We present a non-standard clause form translation that preserves more of the structure of the formula than the conventional translation. This new translation also avoids the exponential increase in size which may occur with the standard translation. We show how this idea may be combined with the idea of replacing predicates by their definitions before converting to clause form. We give a method of lock resolution which is appropriate for the non-standard clause form translation, and which has yielded a spectacular reduction in search space and time for one example. These techniques should increase the attractiveness of resolution theorem provers for program verification applications, since the theorems that arise in program verification are often simple but tedious for humans to prove.},

By translating feature models into propositional formulas and analyzing them with solvers, a wide range of automated analyses across all phases of the software development process become possible. Most solvers only accept formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF), so an additional transformation of feature models is often necessary. However, it is unclear whether this transformation has a noticeable impact on analyses. In this paper, we compare three transformations (i.e., distributive, Tseitin, and Plaisted-Greenbaum) for bringing featuremodel formulas into CNF. We analyze which transformation can be used to correctly perform feature-model analyses and evaluate three CNF transformation tools (i.e., FeatureIDE, KConfigReader, and Z3) on a corpus of 22 real-world feature models. Our empirical evaluation illustrates that some CNF transformations do not scale to complex feature models or even lead to wrong results for modelcounting analyses. Further, the choice of the CNF transformation can substantially influence the performance of subsequent analyses.},

	abstract = {The development of eﬃcient exact and approximate algorithms for probabilistic inference is a long-standing goal of artiﬁcial intelligence research. Whereas substantial progress has been made in dealing with purely discrete or purely continuous domains, adapting the developed solutions to tackle hybrid domains, characterised by discrete and continuous variables and their relationships, is highly non-trivial. Weighted Model Integration (WMI) recently emerged as a unifying formalism for probabilistic inference in hybrid domains. Despite a considerable amount of recent work, allowing WMI algorithms to scale with the complexity of the hybrid problem is still a challenge. In this paper we highlight some substantial limitations of existing state-of-the-art solutions, and develop an algorithm that combines SMT-based enumeration, an eﬃcient technique in formal veriﬁcation, with an eﬀective encoding of the problem structure. This allows our algorithm to avoid generating redundant models, resulting in drastic computational savings. Additionally, we show how SMT-based approaches can seamlessly deal with diﬀerent integration techniques, both exact and approximate, signiﬁcantly expanding the set of problems that can be tackled by WMI technology. An extensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets conﬁrms the substantial advantage of the proposed solution over existing alternatives. The application potential of this technology is further showcased on a prototypical task aimed at verifying the fairness of probabilistic programs.},

	shorttitle = {Handbook of {Satisfiability}},
	abstract = {Propositional logic has been recognized throughout the centuries as one of the cornerstones of reasoning in philosophy and mathematics. Over time, its formalization into Boolean algebra was accompanied by the recognition that a wide range of combinatorial problems can be expressed as propositional satisfiability (SAT) problems. Because of this dual role, SAT developed into a mature, multi-faceted scientific discipline, and from the earliest days of computing a search was underway to discover how to solve SAT problems in an automated fashion. This book, the Handbook of Satisfiability, is the second, updated and revised edition of the book first published in 2009 under the same name. The handbook aims to capture the full breadth and depth of SAT and to bring together significant progress and advances in automated solving. Topics covered span practical and theoretical research on SAT and its applications and include search algorithms, heuristics, analysis of algorithms, hard instances, randomized formulae, problem encodings, industrial applications, solvers, simplifiers, tools, case studies and empirical results. SAT is interpreted in a broad sense, so as well as propositional satisfiability, there are chapters covering the domain of quantified Boolean formulae (QBF), constraints programming techniques (CSP) for word-level problems and their propositional encoding, and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). An extensive bibliography completes each chapter. This second edition of the handbook will be of interest to researchers, graduate students, final-year undergraduates, and practitioners using or contributing to SAT, and will provide both an inspiration and a rich resource for their work. Edmund Clarke, 2007 ACM Turing Award Recipient: "SAT solving is a key technology for 21st century computer science." Donald Knuth, 1974 ACM Turing Award Recipient: "SAT is evidently a killer app, because it is key to the solution of so many other problems." Stephen Cook, 1982 ACM Turing Award Recipient: "The SAT problem is at the core of arguably the most fundamental question in computer science: What makes a problem hard?"},

	abstract = {The exponential complexity in size of the standard clause form translation is often considered as a serious drawback of the resolution method. Fortunately, a polynomial translation is possible by first introducing definitions, one for each subformula of the conjecture. This exhaustiveness can however be proved inefficient when the length of proofs is considered. In order to improve this interesting technique, we first generalize it to renamings, which consist in introducing definitions only for a subset of subformulas, resulting in a wide set of possible clause forms from a single conjecture. We show how a simple and efficient algorithm yields a renaming which, on equivalence-free conjectures, minimizes the number of clauses among these clause forms. This translation has been tested on the famous challenge problem by P. Andrews, yielding a spectacular reduction in search space and time, and therefore is one of the more simple and general technique to efficiently produce a resolution proof for this problem.},

In this paper we present a fast and easy to implement conversion to equisatisﬁable clause form for Boolean circuits, a popular representation of propositional logic formulae. We show that the conversion is equivalent to that of Boy de la Tour and is hence optimal in the number of clauses produced for linear input formulae (formulæ excluding ↔), and we discuss the optimality for other input formulae.},

Using various forms of dual reasoning allows our CDCL-based algorithm to enumerate partial models with no need for exploring and shrinking full models. Our focus is on model enumeration without repetition, with potential applications in weighted model counting and weighted model integration for probabilistic inference over Boolean and hybrid domains. Chronological backtracking renders the use of blocking clauses obsolete. We provide a formalization and examples. We further discuss important design choices for a future implementation related to the strength of dual reasoning, including unit propagation, using SAT or QBF oracles.},

	abstract = {Most resolution theorem provers convert a theorem into clause form before attempting to find a proof. The conventional translation of a first-order formula into clause form often obscures the structure of the formula, and may increase the length of the formula by an exponential amount in the worst case. We present a non-standard clause form translation that preserves more of the structure of the formula than the conventional translation. This new translation also avoids the exponential increase in size which may occur with the standard translation. We show how this idea may be combined with the idea of replacing predicates by their definitions before converting to clause form. We give a method of lock resolution which is appropriate for the non-standard clause form translation, and which has yielded a spectacular reduction in search space and time for one example. These techniques should increase the attractiveness of resolution theorem provers for program verification applications, since the theorems that arise in program verification are often simple but tedious for humans to prove.},

MathSAT5 improves its predecessor MathSAT4 in many ways, also providing novel features: first, a much improved incrementality support, which is vital in SMT applications; second, a full support for the theories of arrays and floating point; third, sound SAT-style Boolean formula preprocessing for SMT formulae; finally, a framework allowing users for plugging their custom tuned SAT solvers. MathSAT5 is freely available, and it is used in numerous internal projects, as well as by a number of industrial partners.},

	abstract = {Feature modeling is widely used to systematically model features of variant-rich software systems and their dependencies. By translating feature models into propositional formulas and analyzing them with solvers, a wide range of automated analyses across all phases of the software development process become possible. Most solvers only accept formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF), so an additional transformation of feature models is often necessary. However, it is unclear whether this transformation has a noticeable impact on analyses. In this paper, we compare three transformations (i.e., distributive, Tseitin, and Plaisted-Greenbaum) for bringing featuremodel formulas into CNF. We analyze which transformation can be used to correctly perform feature-model analyses and evaluate three CNF transformation tools (i.e., FeatureIDE, KConfigReader, and Z3) on a corpus of 22 real-world feature models. Our empirical evaluation illustrates that some CNF transformations do not scale to complex feature models or even lead to wrong results for modelcounting analyses. Further, the choice of the CNF transformation can substantially influence the performance of subsequent analyses.},

	abstract = {The development of eﬃcient exact and approximate algorithms for probabilistic inference is a long-standing goal of artiﬁcial intelligence research. Whereas substantial progress has been made in dealing with purely discrete or purely continuous domains, adapting the developed solutions to tackle hybrid domains, characterised by discrete and continuous variables and their relationships, is highly non-trivial. Weighted Model Integration (WMI) recently emerged as a unifying formalism for probabilistic inference in hybrid domains. Despite a considerable amount of recent work, allowing WMI algorithms to scale with the complexity of the hybrid problem is still a challenge. In this paper we highlight some substantial limitations of existing state-of-the-art solutions, and develop an algorithm that combines SMT-based enumeration, an eﬃcient technique in formal veriﬁcation, with an eﬀective encoding of the problem structure. This allows our algorithm to avoid generating redundant models, resulting in drastic computational savings. Additionally, we show how SMT-based approaches can seamlessly deal with diﬀerent integration techniques, both exact and approximate, signiﬁcantly expanding the set of problems that can be tackled by WMI technology. An extensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets conﬁrms the substantial advantage of the proposed solution over existing alternatives. The application potential of this technology is further showcased on a prototypical task aimed at verifying the fairness of probabilistic programs.},

The fundamental operation in predicate abstraction is to compute the best approximation of a Boolean formula ϕ over a set of predicates P . In this work, we demonstrate the use for this operation of a decision procedure based on the DPLL(T) framework for SAT Modulo Theories (SMT). The new algorithm is based on a careful generation of the set of all satisfying assignments over a set of predicates. It consistently outperforms previous methods by a factor of at least 20, on a diverse set of hardware and software veriﬁcation benchmarks. We report detailed analysis of the results and the impact of a number of variations of the techniques.

    "abstract": "This paper describes the flow past two-dimensional porous plates at a Reynolds number ($Re$) of 30 and for a range of Darcy number ($Da$) and flow incidence ($α$) values. For a plate normal to the stream and vanishing $Da$, the wake shows a vortex dipole with negligible separation from the plate. With increasing $Da$, the separation between the vortex dipole and the plate increases; the vortex dipole shortens and is eventually annihilated at a critical $Da$ between $8 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $9 \\times 10^{-4}$. The drag is found to decrease monotonically with $Da$. For any value of $Da$ below the critical one, the vortex dipole disappears with decreasing $α$. However, this occurs through different topological stages for low and high $Da$. At low $Da$ such as $5 \\times 10^{-5}$, as $α$ decreases, first, one saddle-node pair merges, forming a single recirculating region with negative circulation. Thereafter, the second saddle-node pair merges, annihilating that region. For high $Da$, such as $5 \\times 10^{-4}$, the two saddle-node pairs merge at the same critical incidence, $α=44^\\circ$. The magnitude of lift, drag, and torque decrease with $Da$. However, there exists a range of $Da$ and $α$, where the magnitude of the plate-wise force component increases with $Da$, driven by the shear on the plate's pressure side. The present findings will be directly beneficial in understanding the role of permeability and solidity on small porous and bristled wings.",

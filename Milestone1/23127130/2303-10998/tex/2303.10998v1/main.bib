	abstract = {The Schrieffer-Wolff (SW) method is a version of degenerate perturbation theory in which the low-energy effective Hamiltonian H\_\{eff\} is obtained from the exact Hamiltonian by a unitary transformation decoupling the low-energy and high-energy subspaces. We give a self-contained summary of the SW method with a focus on rigorous results. We begin with an exact definition of the SW transformation in terms of the so-called direct rotation between linear subspaces. From this we obtain elementary proofs of several important properties of H\_\{eff\} such as the linked cluster theorem. We then study the perturbative version of the SW transformation obtained from a Taylor series representation of the direct rotation. Our perturbative approach provides a systematic diagram technique for computing high-order corrections to H\_\{eff\}. We then specialize the SW method to quantum spin lattices with short-range interactions. We establish unitary equivalence between effective low-energy Hamiltonians obtained using two different versions of the SW method studied in the literature. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the precision up to which the ground state energy of the n-th order effective Hamiltonian approximates the exact ground state energy.},

By considering examples, the influence of various factors like form, size, electric and magnetic properties, or intervening media on the forces is addressed.

We solve for the self-consistent equilibrium positions of the atoms, accounting for the backaction of the atoms on the trapping beams. This solution depends strongly on the sign of the trapping laser detuning. For red-detuned trapping lasers, the resulting lattice exhibits a one-dimensional photonic band gap for frequencies between the trapping laser frequency and the atomic resonance. For blue detuning the stop band extends symmetrically about resonance, typically for hundreds of atomic linewidths, except for the small region between atomic resonance and the lattice frequency, which is excluded. We calculate the reflection spectrum for a lattice of Cs atoms for various trapping laser detunings and interpret its behavior as a function of the lattice size and density. For a mean density of 1011 cm-3, and 1000 planes, 55\% reflection of a weak probe beam should be observed. We also consider Bragg scattering in a three-dimensional optical lattice as a means of probing the long-range order in the atomic density correlation function.},

A Green’s-function approach is employed in which all the small-distance singularities are regularized. Application of point scatterers considerably simplifies multiple-scattering calculations needed, for instance, for understanding the optical properties of dense cold gases and optical lattices. In the case of the vector description of light, it is shown that two different regularization parameters are required in order to obtain physically meaningful results. One parameter is related to the physical size of the pointlike scattering particle, while the other is connected to its dynamic properties. All parameters involved are defined in terms of physical observables leading to a complete and self-consistent treatment. The applicability of the point-scatterer model to several physical models is demonstrated. We calculate the local density of states of waves in the presence of one resonant point scatterer. For the vector case, the bare polarizability is shown to enter the local density of states. For a collection of resonant point dipoles, the Lorentz-Lorenz relation for the dielectric constant is derived for cubic lattices and for disordered arrangements.},

The theory is applied to the study of the transient behavior of two atoms that initially share a single excitation, with special emphasis on the role of the two competing processes of virtual- and real-photon exchange in the energy transfer between the atoms. In particular, it is shown that for weak atom-field interaction there is a time window, where the energy transfer follows a rate regime of the type obtained by ordinary second-order perturbation theory. Finally, it is shown that the resonant dipole-dipole interaction can change the singlet line of the emitted light to a doublet spectrum for weak atom-field interaction and the doublet spectrum to a triplet spectrum for strong atom-field interaction.},

We analyze the optical response of an inhomogeneously broadened gas and find that the experimental observations of the resonance line shifts and the total collected scattered light intensity in cold atom clouds substantially deviate from those of thermal atomic ensembles, indicating strong light-induced resonant dipole-dipole interactions between the atoms. At high densities, the simulations also predict a significantly slower decay of light-induced excitations in cold than in thermal atom clouds.

	abstract = {A central goal within quantum optics is to realize efficient, controlled interactions between photons and atomic media. A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based on such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed by atoms and then rescattered into undesired channels. In typical theoretical treatments of atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this rescattering occurs independently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn gives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum memories for light or photonic quantum gates. However, this assumption can in fact be dramatically violated. In particular, it has long been known that spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be significantly suppressed through strong interference in emission between atoms. While this concept of “subradiance” is not new, thus far the techniques to exploit the effect have not been well understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive treatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free space, subradiant states acquire an elegant interpretation in terms of optical modes that are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends of the finite system. We also go beyond the typically studied regime of a single atomic excitation and elucidate the properties of subradiant states in the many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of “selective radiance.” Whereas subradiant states experience a reduced coupling to all optical modes, selectively radiant states are tailored to simultaneously radiate efficiently into a desired channel while scattering into undesired channels is suppressed, thus enabling an enhanced atom-light interface. We show that these states naturally appear in chains of atoms coupled to nanophotonic structures, and we analyze the performance of photon storage exploiting such states. We find numerically that selectively radiant states allow for a photon storage error that scales exponentially better with the number of atoms than previously known bounds.},

In contrast to extinction experiments with single quantum emitters, exciton-exciton interactions lead to an enhancement of reflection with increasing power for incident fields that are blue detuned with respect to the exciton resonance. By taking into account quantum fluctuations, we show that the extinction of such a nonlinear mirror is limited; for light intensities leading to maximal reflection, the transmitted field is in a multimode squeezed state.},

	abstract = {A major application for atomic ensembles consists of a quantum memory for light, in which an optical state can be reversibly converted to a collective atomic excitation on demand. There exists a well-known fundamental bound on the storage error, when the ensemble is describable by a continuous medium governed by the Maxwell–Bloch equations. However, these equations are semi-phenomenological, as they treat emission of the atoms into other directions other than the mode of interest as being independent. On the other hand, in systems such as dense, ordered atomic arrays, atoms interact with each other strongly and spatial interference of the emitted light might be exploited to suppress emission into unwanted directions, thereby enabling improved error bounds. Here, we develop a general formalism that fully accounts for spatial interference, and which finds the maximum storage efficiency for a single photon with known spatial input mode into a collection of atoms with discrete, known positions. As an example, we apply this technique to study a finite two-dimensional square array of atoms. We show that such a system enables a storage error that scales with atom number N a like \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/20/8/083048/njpaadb74ieqn1.gif] \${\textbackslash}sim ({\textbackslash}mathrmlogN\_{\textbackslash}rma){\textasciicircum}2/N\_{\textbackslash}rma{\textasciicircum}2\$ , and that, remarkably, an array of just 4 × 4 atoms in principle allows for an error of less than 1\%, which is comparable to a disordered ensemble with an optical depth of around 600.},

We investigate it experimentally using a dense cloud of rubidium atoms probed with near-resonant light. The atoms are confined in a slab geometry with a subwavelength thickness. We probe the optical response of the cloud as its density and hence the strength of the light-induced dipole-dipole interactions are increased. We also describe a theoretical study based on a coupled dipole simulation which is further complemented by a perturbative approach. This model reproduces qualitatively the experimental observation of a saturation of the optical depth, a broadening of the transition, and a blueshift of the resonance.},

In addition to components which are the ordinary longitudinal and transverse dielectric constants, there are components which couple transverse and longitudinal electromagnetic disturbances. A formalism for calculating the local-field corrections to the dielectric constant is developed in detail for the case of the longitudinal dielectric constant of a cubic insulating solid.

It is proved that the acceleration term contains no local field correction whereas the atomic term does contain a local field correction. The local field correction is calculated explicitly for the weak binding limit and is found to be of the same order in the weak potential as the atomic term, but the coefficient is much smaller for most Fermi surfaces. This justifies, for most Fermi surfaces, the common practice of neglecting local field corrections. In the tight-binding limit, the Lorentz expression for the dielectric constant is obtained.},

Specially designed two-dimensional (2D) arrays of nanometer-scale metallic antennas, or metasurfaces, may allow bulky optical components to be shrunk down to a planar device structure. Khorasaninejad et al. show that arrays of nanoscale fins of TiO can function as high-end optical lenses. At just a fraction of the size of optical objectives, such planar devices could turn your phone camera or your contact lens into a compound microscope. Maguid et al. interleaved sparse 2D arrays of metal antennas to get multifunctional behavior from the one planar device structure (see the Perspective by Litchinitser). The enhanced functionality of such designed metasurfaces could be used in sensing applications or to increase the communication capacity of nanophotonic networks.
Science, this issue pp. 1190 and 1202; see also p. 1177
Subwavelength resolution imaging requires high numerical aperture (NA) lenses, which are bulky and expensive. Metasurfaces allow the miniaturization of conventional refractive optics into planar structures. We show that high-aspect-ratio titanium dioxide metasurfaces can be fabricated and designed as metalenses with NA = 0.8. Diffraction-limited focusing is demonstrated at wavelengths of 405, 532, and 660 nm with corresponding efficiencies of 86, 73, and 66\%. The metalenses can resolve nanoscale features separated by subwavelength distances and provide magnification as high as 170×, with image qualities comparable to a state-of-the-art commercial objective. Our results firmly establish that metalenses can have widespread applications in laser-based microscopy, imaging, and spectroscopy.

Furthermore, by using the so-called “modern theory of polarization” and by studying the spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlations functions, we have characterized in detail the crossover between the weakly and strongly correlated regimes of this atomic chain. Our results show that variational Monte Carlo provides an accurate and flexible alternative to highly correlated methods of quantum chemistry which, at variance with these methods, can be also applied to a strongly correlated solid in low dimensions close to a crossover or a phase transition.},

We address this problem with controlled accuracy in the thermodynamic limit using self-energy diagrammatic determinant Monte Carlo and dynamical cluster approximation methods and show that development of long-range AFM correlations drives an extended crossover from Fermi liquid to insulating behavior in the parameter regime that precludes a metal-to-insulator transition.

In order to resolve the disagreement, have performed high-precision variational calculations in Hylleraas coordinates. With the double basis set method, we have been able to obtain good convergence for Z very close to Zc, which together with the Hellmann-Feynman theorem yields the value Zc=0.911 028 224 077 255 73(4), corresponding to 1/Zc=1.097 660 833 738 559 80(5). This value is in agreement with the value obtained by Baker et al. [Phys. Rev. A 41, 1247 (1990)]. A significant feature of the results is that the outer electron remains localized near the nucleus, even at Z=Zc, and the bound state evidently changes smoothly into a shape resonance for Z{\textless}Zc. A qualitative polarization potential is proposed to account for the resonance, and the radial distribution function for the electron density is calculated.},

	abstract = {It is interesting to observe that all optical materials with a positive refractive index have a value of index that is of order unity. Surprisingly, though, a deep understanding of the mechanisms that lead to this universal behavior seems to be lacking. Moreover, this observation is difficult to reconcile with the fact that a single isolated atom is known to have a giant optical response, as characterized by a resonant scattering cross section that far exceeds its physical size. Here, we theoretically and numerically investigate the evolution of the optical properties of an ensemble of ideal atoms as a function of density, starting from the dilute gas limit, including the effects of multiple scattering and near-field interactions. Interestingly, despite the giant response of an isolated atom, we find that the maximum index does not indefinitely grow with increasing density but rather reaches a limiting value of n≈1.7. This limit arises purely from electrodynamics, as it occurs at densities far below those where chemical processes become important. We propose an explanation based upon strong-disorder renormalization group theory, in which the near-field interaction combined with random atomic positions results in an inhomogeneous broadening of atomic resonance frequencies. This mechanism ensures that, regardless of the physical atomic density, light at any given frequency only interacts with at most a few near-resonant atoms per cubic wavelength, thus limiting the maximum index attainable. Our work is a promising first step to understand the limits of the refractive index from a bottom-up, atomic physics perspective, and it also introduces the renormalization group as a powerful tool to understand the generally complex problem of multiple scattering of light overall.},

The effective potential has been formulated in a way which simplifies computations while producing wave functions of ab initio quality. The effective potential is expressed in an analytic form which (i) represents the actual ab initio nonlocal potential (as defined by the matrix elements for a given basis set) and (ii) permits efficient computations of the effective-potential integrals (by incorporating the properties of Gaussian basis functions). To minimize the number of basis functions required in the molecular calculations, we define a new ab initio effective potential derived from modified Hartree-Fock valence orbitals whose core character has been removed. The effective-potential method as formulated becomes a very strong and reliable tool in attempting calculations on very large molecules. Applications to Li, Na, and K are presented.},

The properties of these potentials are discussed in the context of earlier approaches, and their numerous recent successful applications are summarized. While the generation of these pseudopotentials from all-electron atom calculations is straightforward in principle, detailed consideration of the differences in physics of various groups of atoms is necessary to achieve pseudopotentials with the most desirable attributes. One important attribute developed here is optimum transferability to various systems. Another is the ability to be fitted with a small set of analytic functions useful with a variety of wave-function representations. On the basis of these considerations, a consistent set of pseudopotentials has been developed for the entire Periodic Table. Relativistic effects are included in a way that enables the potentials to be used in nonrelativistic formulations. The scheme used to generate the numerical potentials, the fitting procedure, and the testing of the fit are discussed. Representative examples of potentials are shown that display attributes spanning the set. A complete tabulation of the fitted potentials is given along with a guide to its use.},

	abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, but an alternative representation in terms of localized “Wannier functions” was introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or “Boys orbitals” as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.},

Site-resolved density correlations reveal the Pauli hole at low filling, and strong doublon-hole correlations near half filling. These are shown to account for the difference between local and nonlocal density fluctuations in the Mott insulator.

The initial functions of the FC theory were formulated based on the atomic states of the hydrogen atom and its positive and negative ions at the dissociation limits. The local Schrödinger equation (LSE) method, which is a simple sampling-type integral-free methodology, was employed instead of the ordinary variational method and highly accurate results were obtained stably and smoothly along the potential energy curves. Thus, with the FC-LSE method, we succeeded to perform the comprehensive studies of the H2 molecule from the ground to excited states belonging up to higher angular momentum symmetries and from equilibriums to dissociation limits with almost satisfying spectroscopic accuracy, i.e., 10−6 hartree order around 1 cm−1, as absolute solutions of the SE by moderately small calculations.},

	abstract = {An ensemble of emitters can behave very differently from its individual constituents when they interact coherently via a common light field. After excitation of such an ensemble, collective coupling can give rise to a many-body quantum phenomenon that results in short, intense bursts of light—so-called superfluorescence1. Because this phenomenon requires a fine balance of interactions between the emitters and their decoupling from the environment, together with close identity of the individual emitters, superfluorescence has thus far been observed only in a limited number of systems, such as certain atomic and molecular gases and a few solid-state systems2–7. The generation of superfluorescent light in colloidal nanocrystals (which are bright photonic sources practically suited for optoelectronics8,9) has been precluded by inhomogeneous emission broadening, low oscillator strength, and fast exciton dephasing. Here we show that caesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br) perovskite nanocrystals10–13 that are self-organized into highly ordered three-dimensional superlattices exhibit key signatures of superfluorescence. These are dynamically red-shifted emission with more than 20-fold accelerated radiative decay, extension of the first-order coherence time by more than a factor of four, photon bunching, and delayed emission pulses with Burnham–Chiao ringing behaviour14 at high excitation density. These mesoscopically extended coherent states could be used to boost the performance of opto-electronic devices15 and enable entangled multi-photon quantum light sources16,17.},

We show that the relaxation consists of two distinct stages. The initial ultrafast stage with the relaxation time τ∼(ℏ/t0)(J/t0)−2/3 (where t0 is the hopping integral and J is the exchange interaction) is based on the generation of string states in the close proximity of the carrier. This unusual scaling of τ is obtained by means of the comparison of numerical results with a simplified t-Jz model on a Bethe lattice. In the subsequent (much slower) stage, local antiferromagnetic excitations are carried away by magnons. The relaxation time on the two-legged ladder system is an order of magnitude longer due to the lack of string excitations. This further reinforces the importance of string excitations for the ultrafast relaxation in the two-dimensional system.},

Special emphasis is given to calculations performed with the help of computers applied to models of strongly correlated electrons proposed to describe the two-dimensional CuO2 planes. The review also includes results using several analytical techniques. The one- and three-band Hubbard models and the t−J model are discussed, and their behavior compared against experiments when available. The author found, among the conclusions of the review, that some experimentally observed unusual properties of the cuprates have a natural explanation through Hubbard-like models. In particular, abnormal features like the mid-infrared band of the optical conductivity σ(ω), the new states observed in the gap in photoemission experiments, the behavior of the spin correlations with doping, and the presence of phase separation in the copper oxide superconductors may be explained, at least in part, by these models. Finally, the existence of superconductivity in Hubbard-like models is analyzed. Some aspects of the recently proposed ideas to describe the cuprates as having a dx2−y2 superconducting condensate at low temperatures are discussed. Numerical results favor this scenario over others. It is concluded that computational techniques provide a useful, unbiased tool for studying the difficult regime where electrons are strongly interacting, and that considerable progress can be achieved by comparing numerical results against analytical predictions for the properties of these models. Future directions of the active field of computational studies of correlated electrons are briefly discussed.},

We predict the formation of exotic states that spontaneously break rotational symmetry at relatively low filling. These states belong to three nematic phases: Wigner crystal, supersolid, and superfluid. The Wigner crystal phase is established exactly at low filling. Supersolid and superfluid phases, at larger filling, are obtained by making use of a projection onto the flat band, construction of an appropriate Wannier basis, and subsequent mean-field treatment. The nematic superfluid that we predict is uniform in real space but has an anisotropic momentum distribution, providing a novel scenario for Bose condensation with an additional nematic order.

	abstract = {Versatile interfaces with strong and tunable light–matter interactions are essential for quantum science1 because they enable mapping of quantum properties between light and matter1. Recent studies2–10 have proposed a method of controlling light–matter interactions using the rich interplay of photon-mediated dipole–dipole interactions in structured subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters. However, a key aspect of this approach—the cooperative enhancement of the light–matter coupling strength and the directional mirror reflection of the incoming light using an array of quantum emitters—has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Here we report the direct observation of the cooperative subradiant response of a two-dimensional square array of atoms in an optical lattice. We observe a spectral narrowing of the collective atomic response well below the quantum-limited decay of individual atoms into free space. Through spatially resolved spectroscopic measurements, we show that the array acts as an efficient mirror formed by a single monolayer of a few hundred atoms. By tuning the atom density in the array and changing the ordering of the particles, we are able to control the cooperative response of the array and elucidate the effect of the interplay of spatial order and dipolar interactions on the collective properties of the ensemble. Bloch oscillations of the atoms outside the array enable us to dynamically control the reflectivity of the atomic mirror. Our work demonstrates efficient optical metamaterial engineering based on structured ensembles of atoms4,8,9 and paves the way towards controlling many-body physics with light5,6,11 and light–matter interfaces at the single-quantum level7,10.},

	abstract = {We propose the combination of subwavelength, two-dimensional atomic arrays and Rydberg interactions as a powerful platform to realize strong, coherent interactions between individual photons with high fidelity. The atomic spatial ordering guarantees efficient atom-light interactions without the possibility of scattering light into unwanted directions, allowing the array to act as a perfect mirror for individual photons. In turn, Rydberg interactions enable single photons to alter the optical response of the array within a potentially large blockade radius Rb, which can effectively punch a large “hole” for subsequent photons. We show that such a system enables a coherent photon-photon gate or switch, with a significantly better error scaling (∼R−4b) than in a disordered ensemble. We also investigate the optical properties of the system in the limit of strong input intensities and show that this many-body quantum driven dissipative system can be modeled well by a semiclassical model based on holes punched in a classical mirror.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the density of states and the mobility of an extra electron or hole are calculated in the atomic limit of the Hubbard model. Both the half-filled single-band and multiple-band situations are discussed. The problem is formulated in terms of the number of paths which return to the origin leaving the spin configuration unchanged. The density of states then depends on spin configuration and we have considered the random (R) (high-temperature) and antiferromagnetic (AF) arrangements. Examination of the first five nonzero moments for the simple cubic lattice indicates that the bands are narrowed by a factor of 0.745 (AF) and 0.805 (R). However, the exact bands have tails extending out to the full free-particle width for both spin arrangements. An approximate one-particle Green's function is obtained by summing all graphs with no closed loops. Such paths give a density of states that is independent of spin arrangement and is relatively flat with a sharp square-root edge at 2(z−1)12t. Here z is the coordination number and t is the nearest-neighbor hopping integral. Within this approximation, we have calculated the mobility of an extra hole and have found typical values to be ∼1 cm2/V sec so that the mobility is rather small, even though the density of states has a width of order ∼1 eV. Intra-atomic exchange is shown to give a further narrowing of the band [a factor of (2)−1/2 in the two-band large-intra-atomic-exchange example]. The effect of finite tU is considered, where U is the intra-atomic Coulomb interaction, and is shown to have a strong effect on the band tail but relatively weak effects on the bulk of the band. Finally, we make a few remarks comparing our results with the observed mobilities in NiO and the relevance of intra-atomic exchange to the behavior of the dioxide and sesquioxide series.},

	abstract = {The spin-½ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice is used to describe the dynamics of the spin degrees of freedom of undoped copper oxides. Even though the model lacks an exact solution, a solid, accurate, and rather conventional picture emerges from a number of techniques—analytical (spin-wave theory, Schwinger boson mean-field theory, renormalization-group calculations), semianalytical (variational theory, series expansions), and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, etc.). At zero temperature, the effect of the zero-point fluctuations is not strong enough to destroy the antiferromagnetic long-range order, despite the fact that we are dealing with a low-spin low-dimensional system. The corrections to the spin-wave theory, which treats perturbatively the effect of such fluctuations around the classical Néel ground state, appear to be small. At any nonzero temperature the order disappears and the correlation length at low temperature T(kBTJ≪1, where J is the antiferromagnetic coupling) follows the singular form ξ(T)=Cexp(αJkBT). In the long-wavelength limit and at low T, the model has the same behavior as the quantum nonlinear σ model in two spatial dimensions and one Euclidean time dimension, which we also study with available analytical and Monte Carlo techniques. The quasiparticles of the theory are bosons; at low T and for wavelengths shorter than the correlation length they are welldefined spin-wave excitations. The spectrum of such excitations and the temperature-dependent correlation length have been determined by neutron and Raman scattering experiments done on La2CuO4. The good agreement of the experimental data with the predictions of this theory suggests that the magnetic state of the undoped materials is the conventional ordered state. We discuss, within a simple mean-field theory, the effect of weak three-dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling and the role of an antisymmetric term, introduced to explain a hidden ferromagnetic behavior of the uniform susceptibility. We find that understanding the copper-oxide antiferromagnetic insulator is only the first essential step towards the development of a theory of the superconductor created upon doping such materials.},

We report suppression of the noise by fabricating photonic crystal waveguides in a gallium arsenide membrane containing quantum dots embedded in a p-i-n diode. Local electrical contacts in the vicinity of the waveguides minimize the leakage current and allow fast electrical control (≈4 MHz bandwidth) of the quantum dot resonances. Resonant linewidth measurements of 51 quantum dots coupled to the photonic crystal waveguides exhibit near transform-limited emission over a 6 nm wide range of emission wavelengths.

	abstract = {Developing a quantum photonics network requires a source of very-high-fidelity single photons. An outstanding challenge is to produce a transform-limited single-photon emitter to guarantee that single photons emitted far apart in the time domain are truly indistinguishable. This is particularly difficult in the solid-state as the complex environment is the source of noise over a wide bandwidth. A quantum dot is a robust, fast, bright and narrow-linewidth emitter of single photons; layer-by-layer growth and subsequent nano-fabrication allow the electronic and photonic states to be engineered. This represents a set of features not shared by any other emitter but transform-limited linewidths have been elusive. Here, we report transform-limited linewidths measured on second timescales, primarily on the neutral exciton but also on the charged exciton close to saturation. The key feature is control of the nuclear spins, which dominate the exciton dephasing via the Overhauser field.},

However, currently available high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) nanodiamonds have a high concentration of paramagnetic impurities that limit their spin coherence time to the order of microseconds, less than 1\% of that observed in bulk diamond. In this work, we use a porous metal mask and a reactive ion etching process to fabricate nanocrystals from high-purity chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond. We show that NV centers in these CVD nanodiamonds exhibit record-long spin coherence times in excess of 200 μs, enabling magnetic field sensitivities of 290 nT Hz–1/2 with the spatial resolution characteristic of a 50 nm diameter probe.},

	abstract = {The controlled creation of defect centre—nanocavity systems is one of the outstanding challenges for efficiently interfacing spin quantum memories with photons for photon-based entanglement operations in a quantum network. Here we demonstrate direct, maskless creation of atom-like single silicon vacancy (SiV) centres in diamond nanostructures via focused ion beam implantation with ∼32 nm lateral precision and {\textless}50 nm positioning accuracy relative to a nanocavity. We determine the Si+ ion to SiV centre conversion yield to be ∼2.5\% and observe a 10-fold conversion yield increase by additional electron irradiation. Low-temperature spectroscopy reveals inhomogeneously broadened ensemble emission linewidths of ∼51 GHz and close to lifetime-limited single-emitter transition linewidths down to 126±13 MHz corresponding to ∼1.4 times the natural linewidth. This method for the targeted generation of nearly transform-limited quantum emitters should facilitate the development of scalable solid-state quantum information processors.},

The effective evolution involves a single effective Hamiltonian and one effective Lindblad operator for each naturally occurring decay process. Simple expressions are derived for the effective operators which can be directly applied to reach effective equations of motion for the ground states. We compare our method with the hitherto existing concepts for effective interactions and present physical examples for the application of our formalism, including dissipative state preparation by engineered decay processes.},

	abstract = {Increasing the refractive index available for optical and nanophotonic systems opens new vistas for design, for applications ranging from broadband metalenses to ultrathin photovoltaics to high-quality-factor resonators. In this work, fundamental limits to the refractive index of any material are derived, given only the underlying electron density and either the maximum allowable dispersion or the minimum bandwidth of interest. In the realm of small to modest dispersion, the bounds are closely approached and not surpassed by a wide range of natural materials, showing that nature has already nearly reached a Pareto frontier for refractive index and dispersion. Conversely, for narrow-bandwidth applications, nature does not provide the highly dispersive, high-index materials that the bounds suggest should be possible. The theory of composites to identify metal-based metamaterials that can exhibit small losses and sizeable increases in refractive index over the current best materials is used. Moreover, if the “elusive lossless metal” can be synthesized, it is shown that it would enable arbitrarily high refractive index in the high-dispersion regime, nearly achieving the bounds even at refractive indices of 100 and beyond at optical frequencies.},

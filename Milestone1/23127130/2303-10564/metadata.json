    "abstract": "Chiplets are micro-particles immersed in a dielectric fluid. In micro-assembly applications, an ensemble of chiplets are steered using dielectrophoretic forces induced by an array of electrode population. Generalizing the finite population deterministic models proposed in prior works for individual chiplet position dynamics, we derive a controlled mean field model for a continuum of chiplet population in the form of a nonlocal nonlinear partial differential equation. The proposed model accounts for the stochastic forcing as well as two different types of nonlocal interactions, viz. chiplet-to-chiplet and chiplet-to-electrode interactions. Both of these interactions are nonlinear functions of the electrode voltage input. We prove that the deduced mean field evolution can be expressed as the Wasserstein gradient flow of a Lyapunov-like energy functional on the manifold of joint population density functions with finite second moments that are supported on the position coordinates.",

    "abstract": "Let $t$ be any imaginary quadratic integer with $|t|\\geq 100$. We prove that the inequality \\[\n  |F_t(X,Y)|\n  = | X^4 - t X^3 Y - 6 X^2 Y^2 + t X Y^3 + Y^4 |\n  \\leq 1 \\] has only trivial solutions $(x,y)$ in integers of the same imaginary quadratic number field as $t$. Moreover, we prove results on the inequalities $|F_t(X,Y)| \\leq C|t|$ and $|F_t(X,Y)| \\leq |t|^{2 -\\varepsilon}$. These results follow from an approximation result that is based on the hypergeometric method. The proofs in this paper require a fair amount of computations, for which the code (in Sage) is provided.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews recent cross-section measurements of top-quark pair production in association with a photon, W or Z boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). All measurements reviewed use proton-proton (pp) datasets collected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments between 2016 and 2018 from collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during the LHC Run 2. Differential and inclusive cross-section measurements are discussed along with the constraints on the effective field theory operators accessible through each process. Finally, we discuss the potential for measurements of these processes at future colliders.",

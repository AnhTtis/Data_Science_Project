\section{Conclusion}
We propose {\name} to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D faces with realistic and animatable details from a single image. 
%
Our motivation and insights stand on the spirit of 3DMMs to simplify the challenging detail generation into more accessible regression and interpolation tasks.
%
To achieve this, we elaborately design {\module} to decouple the static and dynamic factors explicitly, and interpolate the dynamic details through vertex tension. We succeed in learning the coarse shape and details jointly by proposing several novel loss functions to train on synthetic and real-world data. 
%
Extensive experiments demonstrate that {\name} achieves state-of-the-art reconstructed performance quantitatively and qualitatively in both the coarse shape and detail shape, and the details are well decoupled and naturally animatable.

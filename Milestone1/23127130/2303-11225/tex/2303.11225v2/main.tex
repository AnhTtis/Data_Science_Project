\begin{abstract}
    3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) demonstrate great potential for reconstructing faithful and animatable 3D facial surfaces from a single image.
    The facial surface is influenced by the coarse shape, as well as the static detail ({\eg}, person-specific appearance) and dynamic detail ({\eg}, expression-driven wrinkles). Previous work struggles to decouple the static and dynamic details through image-level supervision, leading to reconstructions that are not realistic. 
    %
    In this paper, we aim at high-fidelity 3D face reconstruction and propose {\name} to explicitly model the static and dynamic details. 
    Specifically, the static detail is modeled as the linear combination of a displacement basis, while the dynamic detail is modeled as the linear interpolation of two displacement maps with polarized expressions. 
    We exploit several loss functions to jointly learn the coarse shape and fine details with both synthetic and real-world datasets, which enable {\name} to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D shapes with animatable details.
    Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that {\name} presents state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and faithfully recovers both the static and dynamic details.

\caption{We propose {\name} to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D face with realistic and animatable details. \textbf{Reconstruction}: given a single image (1st-row), {\name} faithfully reconstructs a coarse shape (2nd-row) with vivid details (3rd-row). \textbf{Animation}: given a source face (yellow box), {\name} can animate the static (4th-row), dynamic (5th-row), or both (6th-row) details of the driving images (green box). Images are taken from FFHQ~\cite{karras2019style} and CelebA~\cite{CelebAMask-HQ}.

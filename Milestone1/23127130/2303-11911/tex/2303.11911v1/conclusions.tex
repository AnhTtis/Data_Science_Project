We propose an information-aware criteria of data augmentations for time series data that good augmentations should preserve high variety and high fidelity.  We approximate the criteria with a mutual information neural estimation and cross-entropy estimation. Based on the approximated criteria, we adopt a meta-learner network to adaptively select optimal augmentations for contrastive representation learning. Comprehensive experiments show that representations produced by our method are high qualified and easy to use in various downstream tasks, such as time series forecasting and classification, with state-of-the-art performances.

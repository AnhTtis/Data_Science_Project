    "abstract": "Due to the rapid dynamics and a mass of uncertainties in the quantitative markets, the issue of how to take appropriate actions to make profits in stock trading remains a challenging one. Reinforcement learning (RL), as a reward-oriented approach for optimal control, has emerged as a promising method to tackle this strategic decision-making problem in such a complex financial scenario. In this paper, we integrated two prior financial trading strategies named constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) and time-invariant portfolio protection (TIPP) into multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) and proposed two specifically designed multi-agent RL (MARL) methods: CPPI-MADDPG and TIPP-MADDPG for investigating strategic trading in quantitative markets. Afterward, we selected 100 different shares in the real financial market to test these specifically proposed approaches. The experiment results show that CPPI-MADDPG and TIPP-MADDPG approaches generally outperform the conventional ones.",

abstract = {This paper considers the accuracy of projection method approximations to the initial–boundary-value problem for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The issue of how to correctly specify numerical boundary conditions for these methods has been outstanding since the birth of the second-order methodology a decade and a half ago. It has been observed that while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the L∞-norm. This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary conditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed. The connection between the boundary conditions for projection methods and the gauge method is explained in detail.}

abstract = "This paper presents finite-difference solutions to the evolution of small-amplitude disturbances and incompressible fully developed turbulent channel flow. The main objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive comparison between the results obtained using finite-difference and spectral methods. An advantage of finite-difference schemes over the highly accurate spectral methods lies in the ease with which they can be applied to complex geometries. The finite-difference methods used include a kinetic-energy-conserving type of central difference scheme and a high-order-accurate upwind difference scheme. Unlike the central difference scheme, the upwind difference scheme was found not to require a kinetic energy conservation property to control aliasing error. The dissipative nature of the upwind scheme results in a damping of the higher frequency content. As a result very little energy is aliased back. The computed data (including first- and second-order statistics) for the turbulent channel flow case are found to compare well with experimental data and earlier spectral simulations. It appears that the high-order-accurate upwind scheme is a good candidate for direct simulations of turbulent flows over complex geometries."

abstract = "Two numerical methods were designed to solve the time-dependent, three-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in boundary layers (method A, semi-infinite domain) and mixing layers or wakes (method B, fully-infinite domain). Their originality lies in the use of rapidly-decaying spectral basis functions to approximate the vertical dependence of the solutions, combined with one (method A) or two (method B) slowly-decaying “extra functions” for each wave-vector that exactly represent the irrotational component of the solution at large distances. Both methods eliminate the pressure term as part of the formulation, thus avoiding fractional-step time integration. They yield rapid convergence and are free of spurious modes in the Orr-Sommerfeld spectra. They are also efficient, although the operation count is of order N2 (N is the number of modes in the infinite direction). These methods have been used for extensive direct numerical simulations of transition and turbulence. A new time-integration scheme, with low storage requirements and good stability properties, is also described."

In these numerical simulations, the granular soil was represented by a 2-D random array of elastic, rough quartz particles. The random array consists of a mixture of circular and elliptical particles. The numerical results were compared with available experimental data on actual sands with good agreement.

In view of the current available methods in two-dimensional (2D) condition, two different contact detection algorithms for ellipsoidal particles in 3D modelling are identified. Their accuracy and efficiency are compared and the results favour the algorithm based on the geometric potential concept.

The method is tested by comparing the evolution of a free vortex ring and its collision with a wall with the theory, experiments, and other numerical results. The formation of a tripolar vortex, where the highest vorticity is atr= 0, is also considered.

abstract = {A Lagrange-multiplier-based fictitious-domain method (DLM) for the direct numerical simulation of rigid particulate flows in a Newtonian fluid was presented previously. An important feature of this finite element based method is that the flow in the particle domain is constrained to be a rigid body motion by using a well-chosen field of Lagrange multipliers. The constraint of rigid body motion is represented by u=U+ω×r; u being the velocity of the fluid at a point in the particle domain; U and ω are the translational and angular velocities of the particle, respectively; and r is the position vector of the point with respect to the center of mass of the particle. The fluid–particle motion is treated implicitly using a combined weak formulation in which the mutual forces cancel. This formulation together with the above equation of constraint gives an algorithm that requires extra conditions on the space of the distributed Lagrange multipliers when the density of the fluid and the particles match. In view of the above issue a new formulation of the DLM for particulate flow is presented in this paper. In this approach the deformation rate tensor within the particle domain is constrained to be zero at points in the fluid occupied by rigid solids. This formulation shows that the state of stress inside a rigid body depends on the velocity field similar to pressure in an incompressible fluid. The new formulation is implemented by modifying the DLM code for two-dimensional particulate flows developed by others. The code is verified by comparing results with other simulations and experiments.}

In the higher Reynolds number case, particle clusters are formed due to the wake, and vortex shedding enhances them. But clusters cause fluid turbulence resulting in their break-up. The Reynolds-number dependence, the dynamics and the time scale of particle clusters are discussed in this paper."

abstract = {Particle laden flows are of relevant interest in many industrial and natural systems. When the carrier flow is turbulent, a striking feature is the tendency of particles denser than the fluid to inhomogeneously distribute in space, forming clusters and depleted regions. This phenomenon, known as “preferential concentration”, has now been extensively investigated since the 1960s. The commonly invoked turbophoretic effect, responsible for the centrifugation of heavy particles outside the turbulent vortices, has recently got more complex by other additional mechanisms which have been shown to potentially play an important role in segregating the particles (for instance particles with moderate Stokes number have been shown to preferentially stick to low-acceleration points of the carrier flow). As a matter of fact a complete frame for accurately describing and modeling the particle-flow interaction is not yet available and basic questions, as the existence or not of a typical cluster size or of a typical cluster life-time-scale, still remain to be answered. This requires further quantitative investigations of preferential concentration (both from experiments and numerics) as well as dedicated mathematical tools in order to analyze the dispersed phase, its structuring properties and its dynamics (from individual particle level up to clusters level). This review focuses on the description of the techniques available nowadays to investigate the preferential concentration of inertial particles in turbulent flows. We first briefly recall the historical context of the problem followed by a description of usual experimental and numerical configurations classically employed to investigate this phenomenon. Then we present the main mathematical analysis techniques which have been developed and implemented up to now to diagnose and characterize the clustering properties of dispersed particles. We show the advantages, drawbacks and complementarity of the different existing approaches. To finish, we present physical mechanisms which have already been identified as important and discuss the expected breakthrough from future investigations.}

For the DFR, techniques of uniform discretization and adaptive discretization were proposed for spherical and non-spherical particles, respectively. The concept of a ‘contact candidate list’ was put forward to speed up the stage of contact detection. For the CFR, a numerical approach was described to determine the contact point between colliding particles. Points generated through the DFR were used to make the initial guess for the numerical, Newton–Raphson based iterations. The proposed algorithms were employed to model hoppers, horizontal rotating cylinders and vibrated beds. By analyzing the dynamics of these systems the number of discrete points required accurately to describe particles using the DFR was determined. The efficiencies of the DFR and the CFR were measured based on the system of a horizontal rotating cylinder. The characteristics of both modeling approaches in granular simulations were highlighted.}

The results show that the effect of density ratio responsible for two qualitatively different oblique oscillating states has a significant impact both on the onset of chaos and on the behavior of fully chaotic states. The observed difference between dense and light spheres is associated to the strength of coupling between fluid and solid degrees of freedom. While the low frequency mode of oblique oscillating state presents specific features due to a strong solid–fluid coupling, the dynamics of the high frequency mode is shown to be driven by the same vortex shedding as the wake of a fixed sphere. The different fluid–solid coupling also determines two different ways how chaos sets in. Two outstanding ordered regimes are evidenced and investigated in the chaotic domain. One of them, characteristic for its helical trajectories, might provide a link to the experimentally evidenced, but so far numerically unexplained, vibrating regime of ascension of light spheres. For fully chaotic states, it is shown that statistical averaging converges in a satisfactory manner. Several statistical characteristics are suggested and evaluated.}

This corresponds to a range of the particle Reynolds number from 185 to 365. In addition to the particle velocity data, extracts of the fluid velocity field are provided, as well as the pressure distribution on the sphere’s surface. Furthermore, the same solid–fluid system is simulated with a particular non-boundary-conforming approach, i.e. the immersed boundary method proposed by Uhlmann (2005a), using various spatial resolutions.

The results evidence that depending on the particle settling regime (i.e.{\textbackslash } Galileo number and particle-to-fluid density ratio) the particles may exhibit strong inhomogeneous spatial distribution. It is found that the particles are preferentially located in regions with downward fluid motion. The particles inside clusters experience larger settling velocities than the average. The flow in all flow cases is observed to exhibit characteristic features of pseudo-turbulence. The particle-induced flow field is further found to be highly anisotropic with dominant vertical components.

We therefore consider the sedimentation of non-spherical (spheroidal) isolated and particle pairs in a viscous fluid via numerical simulations using the Immersed Boundary Method. The simulations performed here show that the critical Galileo number for the onset of secondary motions decreases as the spheroid aspect ratio departs from 1. Above this critical threshold, oblate particles perform a zigzagging motion whereas prolate particles rotate around the vertical axis while having their broad side facing the falling direction. Instabilities of the vortices in the wake follow when farther increasing the Galileo number. We also study the drafting-kissing-tumbling associated with the settling of particle pairs. We find that the interaction time increases significantly for non-spherical particles and, more interestingly, spheroidal particles are attracted from larger lateral displacements. This has important implications for the estimation of collision kernels and can result in increasing clustering in suspensions of sedimenting spheroids."

   abstract = {We study the settling of finite-size rigid spheres in quiescent fluid and in sustained homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) by direct numerical simulations using an immersed boundary method to account for the dispersed solid phase. We consider semi-dilute and dense suspensions of rigid spheres with solid volume fractions ϕ= 0.5 - 10 % , solid-to-fluid density ratio R= 1.02 , and Galileo number (i.e., the ratio between buoyancy and viscous forces) Ga= 145. In HIT, the nominal Reynolds number based on the Taylor microscale is Re λ ≃ 90 , and the ratio between the particle diameter and the nominal Kolmogorov scale is (2 a) / η≃ 12 (being a the particle radius). We find that in HIT the mean settling speed is less than that in quiescent fluid for all ϕ. For ϕ= 0.5 % , the mean settling speed in HIT is 8 % less than in quiescent fluid. However, by increasing the volume fraction the difference in the mean settling speed between quiescent fluid and HIT cases reduces, being only 1.7 % for ϕ= 10 %. Indeed, while at low ϕ the settling speed is strongly altered by the interaction with turbulence, at large ϕ this is mainly determined by the (strong) hindering effect. This is similar in quiescent fluid and in HIT, leading to similar mean settling speeds. On the contrary, particle angular velocities are always found to increase with ϕ. These are enhanced by the interaction with turbulence, especially at low ϕ. In HIT, the correlations of particle lateral velocity fluctuations oscillate around zero before decorrelating completely. The time period of the oscillation seems proportional to the ratio between the integral lengthscale of turbulence and the particle characteristic terminal velocity. Regarding the mean square particle displacement, we find that it is strongly enhanced by turbulence in the direction perpendicular to gravity, even at the largest ϕ. Finally, we investigate the collision statistics for all cases and find the interesting result that the collision frequency is larger in quiescent fluid than in HIT for ϕ= 0.5 - 1 %. This is due to frequent drafting–kissing–tumbling events in quiescent fluid. The collision frequency becomes instead larger in HIT than in still fluid for ϕ= 5 - 10 % , due to the larger relative approaching velocities in HIT, and to the less intense drafting–kissing–tumbling events in quiescent fluid. The collision frequency also appears to be almost proportional to the estimate for small inertial particles uniformly distributed in space, though much smaller. Concerning the turbulence modulation, we find that the mean energy dissipation increases almost linearly with ϕ, leading to a large reduction of Re λ . },

  abstract = {Discrete element method (DEM) has been widely used to study granular materials. However, how to model non-spherical particles is still challenging. Ellipsoidal particles are a typical kind of non-spherical particles in DEM simulations. There are three common methods to calculate the overlap and contact force between two ellipsoidal particles, namely, geometric potential (GP), common normal (CN) and overlap region (OR) methods. These methods are based on different physical concepts and hence will give different results. However, the comprehensive evaluation of these methods is still lacking, leaving DEM users no solid reference for selecting algorithms. In this paper, we conduct detailed comparisons on the penetration depth, contact plane and contact point predicted by the three methods. Particularly, using the orientation discretization method, the results are compared in all orientations quantitatively. It is shown that the difference between GP and CN is the largest whereas OR is always in between. The difference in contact point is relatively small when overlap ratio is small, whereas the difference in contact plane can always be large. Further, the results are directly compared to those obtained from sub-particle scale finite element analyses, which reveals that CN can always accurately predict contact plane and most times contact point, while GP are relatively better in predicting force magnitude. This study not only gives a more clear and comprehensive evaluation of different contact force models for ellipsoidal particles but also establishes an effective framework for comparing and verifying contact force models for general non-spherical particles.},

abstract = "The purpose of this note is to clarify the effect of the finite size of spherical particles upon the characteristics of their spatial distribution through a random Poisson process (RPP). This information is of special interest when using RPP data as a reference for the analysis of the spatial structure of a given (non-RPP) particulate system, in which case ignoring finite-size effects upon the former may yield misleading conclusions. We perform Monte Carlo simulations in triply-periodic spatial domains, and then analyze the particle-centered Voronoï tessellations for solid volume fractions ranging from 10−5 to 0.3. We show that the standard-deviation of these volumes decreases with the solid volume fraction, the deviation from the value of point sets being reasonably approximated by an exponential function. As can be expected, the domain size for which the random assemblies of finite-size particles are generated has a constraining effect if the number of particles per realization is chosen too small. This effect is quantified, and recommendations are given. We have also revisited the case of random point sets (i.e. the limit of vanishing particle diameter), for which we have confirmed the accuracy of the earlier data by Tanemura (2003)."

abstract = "We have performed spectral/spectral-element simulations of a single oblate spheroid with small geometrical aspect ratio settling in an unbounded ambient fluid, for a range of Galileo numbers covering the various regimes of motion (steady vertical, steady oblique, vertical periodic and chaotic). The high-fidelity data provided includes particle quantities (statistics in the chaotic case), as well as flow profiles and pressure maps. The reference data can be used as an additional benchmark for other numerical approaches, where a careful grid convergence study for a specific target parameter point is often useful. We further describe an extension of a specific immersed boundary method (Uhlmann, J. Comput. Phys, 209(2):448–476, 2005) to enable the tracking of non-spherical particles. Finally, the reference cases are computed with this immersed boundary method at various spatial and temporal resolutions, and grid convergence is discussed over the various regimes of spheroidal particle motion. The cross-validation results can serve as a guideline for the design of simulations with the aid of similar non-conforming methods, involving spheroidal particles with Galileo numbers of O(100)."

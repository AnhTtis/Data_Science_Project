    "abstract": "The Legacy e-MERLIN Multi-band Imaging of Nearby Galaxies survey (LeMMINGs) is a statistically-complete census of nuclear accretion and star formation processes in the local Universe. The LeMMINGs observations at 1.5 and 5 GHz yield angular resolutions on 10s milliarcsecond-scales, with sensitivities of 10s $μ$Jy. Awarded 810 hours of observing time, the full statistical sample (at 1.5 GHz) plus several studies of individual objects have now been published. Combined with multi-wavelength follow up observations, this survey will provide a unique legacy data set of our Galactic back yard. We present an overview of the LeMMINGs results so far, including the 1.5 GHz sample results and associated Chandra X-ray data. We describe the next steps for LeMMINGs to analyse the 5 GHz survey and produce widefield images to categories all radio sources in the LeMMINGs galaxies.",

    "abstract": "A variational phase space is constructed for a system of fields on Euclidean space with periodic boundary conditions. An extended action functional is defined such that the Euler-Lagrange equations generate a symplectic flow on the variational phase space. This symplectic flow is numerically integrated as it evolves with respect to the variational parameter. Assuming ergodicity, the resulting flow samples the Euclidean path integral.",

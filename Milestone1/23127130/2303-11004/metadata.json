    "abstract": "Chromosomes are crumpled polymer chains further folded into a sequence of stochastic loops via loop extrusion. While extrusion has been verified experimentally, the particular means by which the extruding complexes bind DNA polymer remains controversial. Here we analyze the behaviour of the contact probability function for a crumpled polymer with loops for the two possible modes of cohesin binding, topological and non-topological mechanisms. As we show, in the non-topological model the chain with loops resembles a comb-like polymer that can be solved analytically using the quenched disorder approach. In contrast, in the topological binding case the loop constraints are statistically coupled due to long-range correlations present in a non-ideal chain, which can be described by the perturbation theory in the limit of small loop densities. As we show, the quantitative effect of loops on a crumpled chain in the case of topological binding should be stronger, which is translated into a larger amplitude of the log-derivative of the contact probability. Our results highlight a physically different organization of a crumpled chain with loops by the two mechanisms of loops formation.",

    "abstract": "We model a quantum system coupled to an environment of damped harmonic oscillators by following the approach of Caldeira-Leggett and adopting the Caldirola-Kanai Lagrangian for the bath oscillators. In deriving the master equation of the quantum system of interest (a particle in a general potential), we show that the potential is modified non-trivially by a new inverted harmonic oscillator term, induced by the damping of the bath oscillators. We analyze numerically the case of a particle in a double-well potential, and find that this modification changes both the rate of decoherence at short times and the well-transfer probability at longer times. We also identify a simple rescaling condition that keeps the potential fixed despite changes in the environmental damping. Here, the increase of environmental damping leads to a slowing of decoherence.",

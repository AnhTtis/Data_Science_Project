    "abstract": "A measurement of the neutrino mass scale will be achieved with cosmological probes in the upcoming decade. On one hand, the inclusion of massive neutrinos in the linear perturbation theory of cosmological structure formation is well understood and can be done accurately with state of the art Boltzmann solvers. On the other hand, the numerical implementation of the Boltzmann equation is computationally expensive and is a bottleneck in those codes. This has motivated the development of more efficient fluid approximations, despite their limited accuracy over all scales of interest, $k \\sim (10^{-3}-10)$Mpc$^{-1}$. In this work we account for the dispersive nature of the neutrino fluid, i.e., the scale dependence in the sound speed, leading to an improved fluid approximation. We show that overall $\\lesssim 5\\%$ errors can be achieved for the neutrino density and velocity transfer functions at redshift $z \\lesssim 5$, which corresponds to an order of magnitude improvement over previous approximation schemes that can be discrepant by as much as a factor of two.",

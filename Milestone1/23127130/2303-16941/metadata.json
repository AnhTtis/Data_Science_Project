    "abstract": "The enigmatic open clusters serve as a constant reminder of the mysteries of the universe, helping to confront astronomical theories. Unknown to many, these clusters often possess tails with inappropriate labels, serving as the tell-tale signs of their historical journey. But unlike typical tails, these extensions can either precede or follow the body, yet they consistently unfold a cosmic mystery to be solved. I present a succinct survey of this subject matter, detailing the intrepid efforts of astronomers who have dared to challenge our knowledge about these creatures, and offer a novel proposal for their nomenclature, while not disregarding the philosophical ramifications.",

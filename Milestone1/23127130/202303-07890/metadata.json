    "abstract": "It is difficult to identify a G-C fullerene directly from its dimensions as\nits lattice is not proportional to that of its archetype in general, although\nthey have the same three-dimensional shape. In this paper, the area scale\nfactor of a G-C fullerene is proved to be an integer, which can be calculated\nfrom its dimensions. All the G-C transformations are k-inflations that can be\neasily identified and inversed, primary transformations whose area scale\nfactors are prime numbers, or composite transformations whose area scale\nfactors are the product of those of its sub-transformations. As the result, a\nmethod to identify any G-C fullerenes according to the area scale factor was\npresented.",

3D reconstruction from calibrated multi-view azimuth maps ($3$ out of $31$ are shown).
An azimuth angle indicates the surface normal's orientation in the image plane, and an azimuth map records the azimuth angles across the entire surface.
We show that azimuth maps can be effectively used for shape and normal recovery.
Color images are for reference only and are not used in shape optimization.

%     We propose tangent space consistency to jointly constrain surface point locations and normal directions, yielding both accurate normal and geometry recovery.t

We present MVAS, an approach for reconstructing surfaces from multi-view azimuth maps. 
By establishing multi-view consistency in the tangent space and optimizing a neural SDF with the TSC loss, MVAS achieves comparable results to MVPS methods without zenith information. 
We verify MVAS's effectiveness with real-world azimuth maps obtained by symmetric-light photometric stereo and polarization measurements. 
Our results suggest that MVAS can enable high-fidelity reconstruction of shapes that have been challenging for traditional MVS methods.

Today, azimuth maps are still more expensive to obtain than ordinary color images, which may limit the application of \mvas. However, the situation will be changed when commercial polarimetric cameras are more accessible.

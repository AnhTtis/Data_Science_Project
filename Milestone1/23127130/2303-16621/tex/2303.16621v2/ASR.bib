ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes an audio data augmentation method based on deep learning in order to improve the performance of dereverberation. Conventionally, audio data are augmented using a room impulse response, which is artificially generated by some methods, such as the image method. The proposed method estimates a reverberation environment model based on a deep neural network that is trained by using clean and recorded audio data as inputs and outputs, respectively. Then, a large amount of a real augmented database is constructed by using the trained reverberation model, and the dereverberation model is trained with the augmented database. The performance of the augmentation model was verified by a log spectral distance and mean square error between the real augmented data and the recorded data. In addition, according to dereverberation experiments, the proposed method showed improved performance compared with the conventional method.},

abstract="In civil aviation radiotelephony communications, misunderstandings between air traffic controllers and flight crews can result in serious aviation accidents. Automatic semantic verification is a promising assistant solution to decrease miscommunication, thanks to advancements in speech and language processing. Unfortunately, existing general speech recognition models are ineffective when it comes to capturing contextual long-distance dependent local similarity features in radiotelephony communications. To address these problems, this paper proposes an end-to-end Conformer-based multi-task learning speech recognition model for Mandarin radiotelephony communications in civil aviation. The Conformer model improves local information capture while retaining the global information modeling capabilities of contextual long-distance dependencies, owing to the introduction of the convolution module to the Transformer model. Meanwhile, multi-task learning is used to further improve performance by combining connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models. The experimental results show that the proposed model can perform global and local acoustic modeling effectively, making it particularly suitable for extracting acoustic features of Mandarin civil aviation radiotelephony communications.",

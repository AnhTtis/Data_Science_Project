    "abstract": "Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be a separable Hilbert space and let $A^{2}_{\\varphi}(\\mathcal{H})$ be the $\\mathcal{H}$-valued Bergman spaces with exponential weights. In the present paper, we give the complete characterizations for the boundedness and compactness of Hankel operators on $A^{2}_{\\varphi}(\\mathcal{H})$. For $p\\geq2$, the Schatten $p$-classes of the Hankel operator with conjugate analytic symbols are studied.",

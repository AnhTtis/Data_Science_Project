    abstract = "{The first comprehensive treatment of active inference, an integrative perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior used across multiple disciplines. Active inference is a way of understanding sentient behavior—a theory that characterizes perception, planning, and action in terms of probabilistic inference. Developed by theoretical neuroscientist Karl Friston over years of groundbreaking research, active inference provides an integrated perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior that is increasingly used across multiple disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Active inference puts the action into perception. This book offers the first comprehensive treatment of active inference, covering theory, applications, and cognitive domains. Active inference is a “first principles” approach to understanding behavior and the brain, framed in terms of a single imperative to minimize free energy. The book emphasizes the implications of the free energy principle for understanding how the brain works. It first introduces active inference both conceptually and formally, contextualizing it within current theories of cognition. It then provides specific examples of computational models that use active inference to explain such cognitive phenomena as perception, attention, memory, and planning.}",

In the grid cells of the mammalian cortex, analog error correction codes have been observed to protect states against neural spiking noise, but their role in information processing is unclear. Here, we use these biological codes to show that a universal fault-tolerant neural network can be achieved if the faultiness of each neuron lies below a sharp threshold; moreover, we find that noisy biological neurons fall below this threshold. The discovery of a phase transition from faulty to fault-tolerant neural computation suggests a mechanism for reliable computation in the cortex and opens a path towards understanding noisy analog systems relevant to artificial intelligence and neuromorphic computing.},

abstract = {Practical quantum computing will require error rates well below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction1,2 offers a path to algorithmically relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, for which increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across several code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find that our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, in terms of both logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ((2.914 ± 0.016) compared to (3.028 ± 0.023)). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a 1.7 × 10-6 logical error per cycle floor set by a single high-energy event (1.6 × 10-7 excluding this event). We accurately model our experiment, extracting error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark an experimental demonstration in which quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

Conventional genetic screens exhibit biases, and genes contributing to a phenotype are often missed. We systematically constructed a nearly complete collection of gene-deletion mutants (96% of annotated open reading frames, or ORFs) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequences dubbed ‘molecular bar codes' uniquely identify each strain, enabling their growth to be analysed in parallel and the fitness contribution of each gene to be quantitatively assessed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, pH 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment. Less than 7% of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger RNA expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions. Our results validate the yeast gene-deletion collection as a valuable resource for functional genomics.},

Cataloging gene sets that provide mutual functional backup, we identify sets of up to eight interacting genes and characterize the 'k robustness' (the depth of backup interactions) of each gene. We find that 74% (360) of the metabolic genes participate in processes that are essential to growth in a standard laboratory environment, compared with only 13% previously found to be essential using single knockouts. The genes' k robustness is shown to be a solid indicator of their biological buffering capacity and is correlated with both the genes' environmental specificity and their evolutionary retention. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Mosley2005,
abstract = {Objective: To examine the association between prevalent cerebral abnormalities identified on MRI and cognitive functioning in a predominantly middle-aged, population-based study cohort. Methods: Cerebral MRI was performed on 1,538 individuals (aged 55 to 72) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort, with no history of stroke or TIA, at study sites in Forsyth County, NC, and Jackson, MS. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs), ventricular size, and sulcal size were graded by trained neuroradiologists on a semiquantitative, 10-point scale. Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Delayed Word Recall Test (DWRT), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and Word Fluency Test (WFT). Results: High ventricular grade was independently associated with significantly lower scores on the DWRT and DSST and greater risk (odds ratio [OR] 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51 to 3.56) of impaired scores (i.e., <10th percentile) on the DWRT. High sulcal grade was associated with a modest decrement in scores on the DWRT. The presence of coexisting high grade WMHs and silent infarcts was independently associated with lower scores on all cognitive tests and greater risk of impaired functioning on the DSST (OR 2.91, 95% CI: 1.23 to 6.89) and WFT (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.03 to 5.08). The presence of two or more high-grade abnormalities was associated with increased risk of impaired functioning on all cognitive tests (DWRT: OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.40 to 3.55; DSST: OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.76; WFT: OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.49) independent of multiple covariates and silent infarcts. Conclusion: Common changes in brain morphology are associated with diminished cognitive functioning in middle-aged and young-elderly individuals.

The most common approach to answering this question is to propose a methodology to verify the existence of such a code. However, none of the methodologies proposed so far, although quite clever, has achieved that goal. In a recent work, we showed that DNA sequences can be identified as codewords in a class of cyclic error-correcting codes known as Hamming codes. In this paper, we show that a complete intron-exon gene, and even a plasmid genome, can be identified as a Hamming code codeword as well. Although this does not constitute a definitive proof that there is an error-correcting code underlying DNA sequences, it is the first evidence in this direction. {\textcopyright} 2012 Faria et al.},

@techreport{Battaii2019,
abstract = {Shannon's channel coding theorem (1948), a major result of information theory, paradoxically states that errorless communication is possible using an unreliable channel. Since then, engineers developed many error-correcting codes and decoding algorithms. A performance close to the predicted one was eventually achieved no earlier than the beginning of the nineties. Many communication facilities would not exist without error-correcting codes, e.g., mobile telephony and terrestrial digital television. This article explains first how they work without mathematical formalism. An error-correcting code is a minority subset among some set of messages. Within this subset, the messages are sufficiently different from each other to be exactly identified even if a number of their symbols, up to a certain limit, are changed. Beyond this limit, another message can be erroneously identified. An error-correcting code is interpreted as a set of messages subjected to constraints which make their symbols mutually dependent. Although mathematical constraints are conveniently used in engineering, constraints of any other kind, possibly of natural origin, can generate error-correcting codes. Biologists implicitly assume that genomes were conserved during the geological ages, without realizing that this is impossible without error-correcting means. Symbol errors occur during replication of a genome; chemical reactions and radiations are other sources of errors. Their number increases with time in the absence of correction. A genomic code will exactly regenerate the genome provided its decoding is attempted after a short enough time interval. If the number of errors is too large, however, the decoded genome will differ from the initial one and a mutation will occur. Periodically attempted decodings thus will conserve a genome except for very infrequent mutations if decoding attempts are frequent enough. The better conservation of very ancient parts of genomes, like the HOX genes, cannot be explained unless assuming that a genomic error-correcting code resulting from a stepwise encoding exists: a first encoding was followed later by a second one where a new information and the result of the first encoding were jointly encoded, and this process was repeated several times, eventually resulting in an overall code made of nested components where the older is an information, the better it is protected. Organic codes in Barbieri's meaning result from the same process and have the same structure. Any new organic code induces new genomic constraints, hence new components in a nested system of codes. Organic codes may thus be identified with the system of nested error-correcting codes needed to conserve the genetic information. A majority of biologists deny that information theory can be useful to them. It is shown on the contrary that the living world cannot be understood if the scientific concept of information is ignored. Heredity makes the present communicate with the past, and as a communication process is relevant to information theory, which is thus a necessary basis of biology besides physics and chemistry. The nested genomic error-correcting codes which are needed for conserving the genetic information account for the hierarchical taxonomy which structures the living world. Moreover, the main features of biological evolution, including its trend towards increasing complexity, find an explanation within this framework. Incorporating the scientific concept of information and the science based on it in the foundations of biology can widely renew the discipline but meets epistemological difficulties which must be overcome.},

Although population activity vectors may have thousands of entries (dimensions), we consider that they trace out a low-dimensional manifold whose dimension and topology match the represented variable. This manifold perspective enables blind discovery and decoding of the represented variable using only neural population activity (without knowledge of the input, output, behavior or topography). We characterize and directly visualize manifold structure in the mammalian head direction circuit, revealing that the states form a topologically nontrivial one-dimensional ring. The ring exhibits isometry and is invariant across waking and rapid eye movement sleep. This result directly demonstrates that there are continuous attractor dynamics and enables powerful inference about mechanism. Finally, external rather than internal noise limits memory fidelity, and the manifold approach reveals new dynamical trajectories during sleep.},

@article{Gardner2022,
abstract = {The medial entorhinal cortex is part of a neural system for mapping the position of an individual within a physical environment1. Grid cells, a key component of this system, fire in a characteristic hexagonal pattern of locations2, and are organized in modules3 that collectively form a population code for the animal's allocentric position1. The invariance of the correlation structure of this population code across environments4,5 and behavioural states6,7, independent of specific sensory inputs, has pointed to intrinsic, recurrently connected continuous attractor networks (CANs) as a possible substrate of the grid pattern1,8–11. However, whether grid cell networks show continuous attractor dynamics, and how they interface with inputs from the environment, has remained unclear owing to the small samples of cells obtained so far. Here, using simultaneous recordings from many hundreds of grid cells and subsequent topological data analysis, we show that the joint activity of grid cells from an individual module resides on a toroidal manifold, as expected in a two-dimensional CAN. Positions on the torus correspond to positions of the moving animal in the environment. Individual cells are preferentially active at singular positions on the torus. Their positions are maintained between environments and from wakefulness to sleep, as predicted by CAN models for grid cells but not by alternative feedforward models12. This demonstration of network dynamics on a toroidal manifold provides a population-level visualization of CAN dynamics in grid cells.},

This nonlocal periodic representation of location, a local variable, is unlike other neural codes. There is no theoretical explanation for why such a code should exist. We examined how accurately the grid code with noisy neurons allows an ideal observer to estimate location and found this code to be a previously unknown type of population code with unprecedented robustness to noise. In particular, the representational accuracy attained by grid cells over the coding range was in a qualitatively different class from what is possible with observed sensory and motor population codes. We found that a simple neural network can effectively correct the grid code.

   abstract = {A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks-their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits-but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes. © 2013 The Authors.},

   abstract = {We study the selective advantage of modularity in artificially evolved networks. Modularity abounds in complex systems in the real world. However, experimental evidence for the selective advantage of network modularity has been elusive unless it has been supported or mandated by the genetic representation. The evolutionary origin of modularity is thus still debated: whether networks are modular because of the process that created them, or the process has evolved to produce modular networks. It is commonly argued that network modularity is beneficial under noisy conditions, but experimental support for this is still very limited. In this article, we evolve nonlinear artificial neural network classifiers for a binary classification task with a modular structure. When noise is added to the edge weights of the networks, modular network topologies evolve, even without representational support. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a systematic transition scheme for a large class of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) into Boolean networks. Our transition scheme can be applied to any system of ODEs whose right hand sides can be written as sums and products of monotone functions. It performs an Euler-like step which uses the signs of the right hand sides to obtain the Boolean update functions for every variable of the corresponding discrete model. The discrete model can, on one hand, be considered as another representation of the biological system or, alternatively, it can be used to further the analysis of the original ODE model. Since the generic transformation method does not guarantee any property conservation, a subsequent validation step is required. Depending on the purpose of the model this step can be based on experimental data or ODE simulations and characteristics. Analysis of the resulting Boolean model, both on its own and in comparison with the ODE model, then allows to investigate system properties not accessible in a purely continuous setting. The method is exemplarily applied to a previously published model of the bovine estrous cycle, which leads to new insights regarding the regulation among the components, and also indicates strongly that the system is tailored to generate stable oscillations.},

abstract = {This paper is an attempt to formalize in Boolean terms genetic situations, from simple concepts like recessitivity and cis-dominance, to models describing complex control circuits. A primary objective was to provide a language describing in a compact and unambiguous way, systems which become more and more difficult to describe as their complexity is being unravelled. Expression of a gene is given as a binary function of binary variables of three types: •“genetic” variables, which describe the state (so-called normal, or mutated in various ways) of genes or recognition sites (promoters, operators, terminators, etc….);•“environmental” variables such as a temperature shift or the presence of a substance above a threshold concentration;•“internal” variables used for memorizing previous states of the system. Circuit engineers use, for memorization, pairs internal functions (Yt) and variables (yt) such that the value of the variable at time t is the same as that of the associated function at time t — Δt; the value of a variable thus serves as a memory of the value of the associated function in the proceeding period (see Florine, 1964). It was realized during this work that concepts like the expression of a gene and the presence of its product are related to each other essentially in the same way as the internal functions Yt and variables yt. Tabulation of the logic equations as Veitch matrices greatly helps in reducing the algebraic expressions (and, hence, the corresponding verbal expressions) to their simplest form. But the main interest of the Veitch tabulation of the equations is that it gives a clear and exhaustive view of all the states of the system as predicted by the model. This is especially useful for sequential problems; the matrices show which states are stable ones, and how the system proceeds from state to state. The logic equations can also be wired up for simulation, using appropriate delays between switching on or off an internal function and its memorization variable. The language proposed is now currently used by the author for clarification of complex models (e.g. in regulation of bacteriophage λ).}

Results: We introduce Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN) that share the appealing rule-based properties of Boolean networks, but are robust in the face of uncertainty. We show how the dynamics of these networks can be studied in the probabilistic context of Markov chains, with standard Boolean networks being special cases. Then, we discuss the relationship between PBNs and Bayesian networks-a family of graphical models that explicitly represent probabilistic relationships between variables. We show how probabilistic dependencies between a gene and its parent genes, constituting the basic building blocks of Bayesian networks, can be obtained from PBNs. Finally, we present methods for quantifying the influence of genes on other genes, within the context of PBNs. Examples illustrating the above concepts are presented throughout the paper.},

   abstract = {The 3D genome has been shown to be organized into modules including topologically associating domains (TADs) and compartments that are primarily defined by spatial contacts from Hi-C. There exists a gap to investigate whether and how the spatial modularity of the chromatin is related to the functional modularity resulting from chromatin activity. Despite histone modifications reflecting chromatin activity, inferring spatial modularity of the genome directly from the histone modification patterns has not been well explored. Here, we report that histone modifications show a modular pattern (referred to as regulation associated modules, RAMs) that reflects spatial chromatin modularity. Enhancer-promoter interactions, loop anchors, super-enhancer clusters and extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are found to occur more often within the same RAMs than within the same TADs. Consistently, compared to the TAD boundaries, deletions of RAM boundaries perturb the chromatin structure more severely (may even cause cell death) and somatic variants in cancer samples are more enriched in RAM boundaries. These observations suggest that RAMs reflect a modular organization of the 3D genome at a scale better aligned with chromatin activity, providing a bridge connecting the structural and functional modularity of the genome.},

ABSTRACT={Brain networks are increasingly understood as one of a large class of information processing systems that share important organizational principles in common, including the property of a modular community structure. A module is topologically defined as a subset of highly inter-connected nodes which are relatively sparsely connected to nodes in other modules. In brain networks, topological modules are often made up of anatomically neighboring and/or functionally related cortical regions, and inter-modular connections tend to be relatively long distance. Moreover, brain networks and many other complex systems demonstrate the property of hierarchical modularity, or modularity on several topological scales: within each module there will be a set of sub-modules, and within each sub-module a set of sub-sub-modules, etc. There are several general advantages to modular and hierarchically modular network organization, including greater robustness, adaptivity, and evolvability of network function. In this context, we review some of the mathematical concepts available for quantitative analysis of (hierarchical) modularity in brain networks and we summarize some of the recent work investigating modularity of structural and functional brain networks derived from analysis of human neuroimaging data.}

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between brain architecture and brain function is a central issue in neuroscience. We modeled realistic spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity on a human connectome with a Boolean networks model with the aim of computationally replicating certain cognitive functions as they emerge from the standardization of many fMRI studies, identified as patterns of human brain activity. Results from the analysis of simulation data, carried out for different parameters and initial conditions identified many possible paths in the space of parameters of these network models, with normal (ordered asymptotically constant patterns), chaotic (oscillating or disordered) but also highly organized configurations, with countless spatial–temporal patterns. We interpreted these results as routes to chaos, permanence of the systems in regimes of complexity, and ordered stationary behavior, associating these dynamics to cognitive processes. The most important result of this work is the study of emergent neural circuits, i.e., configurations of areas that synchronize over time, both locally and globally, determining the emergence of computational analogues of cognitive processes, which may or may not be similar to the functioning of biological brain. Furthermore, results put in evidence the creation of how the brain creates structures of remote communication. These structures have hierarchical organization, where each level allows for the emergence of brain organizations which behave at the next superior level. Taken together these results allow the interplay of dynamical and topological roots of the multifaceted brain dynamics to be understood.},

abstract = {Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA sequences can alter gene expression, organismal phenotype and fitness1–3. Constructing complete fitness landscapes, in which DNA sequences are mapped to fitness, is a long-standing goal in biology, but has remained elusive because it is challenging to generalize reliably to vast sequence spaces4–6. Here we build sequence-to-expression models that capture fitness landscapes and use them to decipher principles of regulatory evolution. Using millions of randomly sampled promoter DNA sequences and their measured expression levels in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we learn deep neural network models that generalize with excellent prediction performance, and enable sequence design for expression engineering. Using our models, we study expression divergence under genetic drift and strong-selection weak-mutation regimes to find that regulatory evolution is rapid and subject to diminishing returns epistasis; that conflicting expression objectives in different environments constrain expression adaptation; and that stabilizing selection on gene expression leads to the moderation of regulatory complexity. We present an approach for using such models to detect signatures of selection on expression from natural variation in regulatory sequences and use it to discover an instance of convergent regulatory evolution. We assess mutational robustness, finding that regulatory mutation effect sizes follow a power law, characterize regulatory evolvability, visualize promoter fitness landscapes, discover evolvability archetypes and illustrate the mutational robustness of natural regulatory sequence populations. Our work provides a general framework for designing regulatory sequences and addressing fundamental questions in regulatory evolution.},

@article{Payne2019,
abstract = {Evolvability is the ability of a biological system to produce phenotypic variation that is both heritable and adaptive. It has long been the subject of anecdotal observations and theoretical work. In recent years, however, the molecular causes of evolvability have been an increasing focus of experimental work. Here, we review recent experimental progress in areas as different as the evolution of drug resistance in cancer cells and the rewiring of transcriptional regulation circuits in vertebrates. This research reveals the importance of three major themes: multiple genetic and non-genetic mechanisms to generate phenotypic diversity, robustness in genetic systems, and adaptive landscape topography. We also discuss the mounting evidence that evolvability can evolve and the question of whether it evolves adaptively.},

This 10th anniversary edition includes an introduction from the authors setting the work in context. This comprehensive textbook describes such remarkable effects as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum error-correction. Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced before moving on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It concludes with an in-depth treatment of quantum information. Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.}

abstract = {Many networks of interest in the sciences, including social networks, computer networks, and metabolic and regulatory networks, are found to divide naturally into communities or modules. The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as “modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.}}

 @article{Tenaillon2020,
abstract = {Beneficial mutations are rare and deleterious mutations are purged by natural selection. As a result, the vast majority of mutations that accumulate in genomes belong to the class of neutral mutations. Over the last two decades, neutral mutations, despite their null effect on fitness, have been shown to affect evolvability by providing access to new phenotypes through subsequent mutations that would not have been available otherwise. Here we propose that in addition, many mutations — independent of their selective effects — can affect the mutability of neighboring DNA sequences and modulate the efficacy of homologous recombination. Such mutations do not change the spectrum of accessible phenotypes, but rather the rate at which new phenotypes will be produced. Therefore, neutral mutations that accumulate in genomes have an important long-term impact on the evolutionary fate of genomes. Neutral mutations can have an important long-term impact on the evolutionary fate of genomes both in terms of the type of evolutionary path that will be followed as well as in the rate at which changes will occur.},

@article{Wagner2008,
abstract = {Understanding the relationship between robustness and evolvability is key to understand how living things can withstand mutations, while producing ample variation that leads to evolutionary innovations. Mutational robustness and evolvability, a system's ability to produce heritable variation, harbour a paradoxical tension. On one hand, high robustness implies low production of heritable phenotypic variation. On the other hand, both experimental and computational analyses of neutral networks indicate that robustness enhances evolvability. I here resolve this tension using RNA genotypes and their secondary structure phenotypes as a study system. To resolve the tension, one must distinguish between robustness of a genotype and a phenotype. I confirm that genotype (sequence) robustness and evolvability share an antagonistic relationship. In stark contrast, phenotype (structure) robustness promotes structure evolvability. A consequence is that finite populations of sequences with a robust phenotype can access large amounts of phenotypic variation while spreading through a neutral network. Population-level processes and phenotypes rather than individual sequences are key to understand the relationship between robustness and evolvability. My observations may apply to other genetic systems where many connected genotypes produce the same phenotypes. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

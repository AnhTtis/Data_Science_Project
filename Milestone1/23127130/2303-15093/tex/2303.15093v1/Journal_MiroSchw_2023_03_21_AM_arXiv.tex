\begin{abstract}
We derive converse Lyapunov theorems for input-to-state stability (ISS) of linear 
infinite-dimensional analytic systems. We show that input-to-state stability of a linear system does not imply 
existence of a coercive quadratic ISS Lyapunov function, even if the input operator is bounded. If, however, the semigroup is similar to a contraction semigroup on a Hilbert space, then a quadratic ISS Lyapunov function always exists for any input operator that is bounded, or more generally, $p$-admissible with $p<2$.
The constructions are semi-explicit and, in the case of self-adjoint generators, coincide with the canonical Lyapunov function being the norm squared.
Finally, we construct a family of non-coercive ISS Lyapunov functions for analytic ISS systems under weaker assumptions on $B$.

\section{Introduction}

Input-to-state stability (ISS) was introduced by Sontag in his celebrated paper \cite{Son89} and has rapidly become a backbone of robust nonlinear control theory with diverse applications to robust stabilization \cite{FrK08}, nonlinear observer design \cite{AnP09}, analysis of large-scale networks \cite{JTP94,DRW10}, event-based control \cite{Tab07}, networked control systems \cite{NeT04}, ISS feedback redesign \cite{Son89}, quantized control \cite{LiH05}, nonlinear detectability \cite{KSW01}, etc.
Recently, the ISS concept has been extended to broad classes of infinite-dimensional systems, including partial differential equations (PDEs) with distributed and boundary controls, semilinear evolution equations in abstract spaces, time-delay systems, etc. \cite{MiW18b,TPT18,JLR08,KaK16b,JNP18,JSZ17,ZhZ18,ZhZ20,KaK19}.
We refer to \cite{MiP20} for a survey of the state of the art of infinite-dimensional ISS theory and its applications to robust control and observation of distributed parameter systems, as well as to \cite{Sch20} for an overview of available results on ISS of linear boundary control systems and some semilinear extensions.

One of the most fundamental concepts of the ISS theory is the notion of an \emph{ISS Lyapunov function}. 
For ODE systems with Lipschitz continuous right hand side, it is known that existence of a coercive ISS Lyapunov function is equivalent to ISS \cite{SoW95}, which was extended to a broad class of semilinear evolution equations with Lipschitz nonlinearities and \emph{distributed} inputs in \cite{MiW17c}.
However, the application of Lyapunov methods for ISS analysis of boundary control systems leads to challenging theoretical problems.
For example, it is well-known that the classic heat equation with Dirichlet boundary inputs is ISS, which has been verified by means of the notion of admissible operators \cite{JNP18}, monotonicity approach \cite{MKK19}, as well as using spectral analysis \cite{KaK16b}. However, no coercive ISS Lyapunov function is known for this system, and an existence of such a function is neither proved nor disproved.
To address this problem, in \cite{MiW18b,MiW19a} the concept of a non-coercive Lyapunov function --- a Lyapunov function that is not necessarily coercive --- has been proposed, and in \cite{JMP20} it was shown that existence of a non-coercive ISS Lyapunov function implies ISS, provided some additional properties of the system are satisfied. In particular, in \cite{JMP20} a quadratic, non-coercive ISS Lyapunov function was constructed for the 1-D heat equation with a Dirichlet boundary input. 
Yet, it remains an open problem, whether a coercive ISS Lyapunov function for such a simple boundary control system exists, which puts into question the applicability of Lyapunov methods for ISS analysis of boundary control systems. 
The problem becomes even more intriguing as for linear parabolic systems with Neumann and Robin boundary inputs and for linear first order hyperbolic systems (systems of conservation laws) rather simple coercive quadratic ISS Lyapunov functions exist \cite{ZhZ18,TPT18}. 
All this makes developing systematic Lyapunov methods for analysis of linear and nonlinear boundary control systems a central problem in the infinite-dimensional ISS theory.

\textbf{Contribution.}
\emph{In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of quadratic ISS Lyapunov functions for linear systems with bounded input operators, and prove the first converse ISS Lyapunov theorems for linear analytic systems with unbounded input operators.}  

In \cite[Theorem 8]{MiW17c}, it was shown that a linear system on a general Banach space with distributed controls is ISS if and only if there exists a coercive ISS Lyapunov function, which is an equivalent norm on $X$. By taking squares, we can always find a 2-homogeneous Lyapunov function, which is however not quadratic in general, even if $X$ is a Hilbert space. Moreover, \cite[Theorem 8]{MiW17c} claims that on Hilbert spaces such a system is ISS if and only if there exists a non-coercive, quadratic ISS Lyapunov function. \emph{In Section~\ref{sec:Coercive quadratic Lyapunov functions for linear systems with bounded input operators}, we show that one cannot expect to have a coercive quadratic Lyapunov function even if additionally the system is supposed to be analytic. However, we also show that a coercive, quadratic Lyapunov function exists if the underlying semigroup is similar to a contraction semigroup on Hilbert space, which not a strong limitation in practice.}


If $B$ is unbounded operator, it is well-known, that $L^2$-ISS is equivalent to $2$-admissibility of $B$ and exponential stability of the underlying semigroup \cite[Proposition 2.10]{JNP18}.
In Section~\ref{sec:coercive-L2-ISS-LFs}, we prove for analytic and similar to contraction semigroups that the condition $B \in L(U,X_{-p})$, $p\in (0,\frac{1}{2})$ (which is somewhat stronger than 2-admissibility) implies the existence of a coercive $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function. If $A$ is additionally self-adjoint, then a weaker condition $B \in L(U,X_{-\frac{1}{2}})$  (still slightly stronger than 2-admissibility) already suffices for the same claim.

Section~\ref{sec:Non-coercive quadratic ISS Lyapunov functions for analytic systems} demonstrates that non-coercive ISS Lyapunov functions can be constructed for linear systems under much less restrictive assumptions.
Our findings are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:Overview-of-results}. 

Our results can be understood as a part of the effort on the development of the methods to analyze ISS of nonlinear PDEs with boundary inputs, or more generally of nonlinear boundary control systems. 
As a rule, Lyapunov methods seem to be the most realistic way to study stability and ISS of nonlinear systems. Hence our long-term aim is to rigorously settle  the applicability of Lyapunov methods to linear systems with bounded input operators and then to extend the methods to treat the nonlinear PDEs with boundary controls and more generally nonlinear boundary control systems.




\textbf{Notation.} Throughout this note $X$ and $Y$ will refer to Banach spaces which may, at instances, be specified to be a Hilbert space with an inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$. 


For a Banach space $(U,\|\cdot\|_U)$ we denote by $L^\infty(0,t;U)$ the space of Bochner measurable functions $u:(0,t)\to U$ with finite essential supremum norm 
$\|u\|_{L^\infty(0,t)}:=\esssup_{s\in(0,t)}\|u(s)\|_U$ and similarly we define the common Lebesgue Bochner spaces $L^p(\Rpn,U)$, $p\in [1,\infty]$.
The space of bounded operators acting from $X$ to a Banach space $Y$ we denote by $L(X,Y)$ and  $L(X):=L(X,X)$.\newline
Denote $\Rpn:=[0,+\infty)$, $(\Rpn)^{2}:=\Rpn\tm\Rpn$ and recall the following well-known classes of comparison functions.
\begin{align*} 
\arraycolsep=1.3pt\def\arraystretch{1.2}
\calK ={}& \{\mu\in C(\Rpn,\Rpn) \:|\: \mu(0)=0, \mu \text{ strictly increasing}\},\\
 \calK_\infty ={}& \{\theta\in\calK \:|\:  \lim_{x\to\infty} \theta(x)=\infty\},\\
\mathcal{L}={}&\{\gamma\in C(\Rpn,\Rpn)\:|\:\gamma \text{ str.\ decreas.,}  \lim_{t\to\infty}\gamma(t)=0 \},\\
\mathcal{KL} = {}&\{ \beta:(\Rpn)^{2}\rightarrow\Rpn\: | \: \beta(\cdot,t)\in\calK\ \forall t,\beta(s,\cdot)\in\mathcal{L}\ \forall s\neq0\}.
\end{align*}
As common, the symbol $\lesssim$ is used to drop absolute multiplicative constants which are not depending on the variables appearing in the inequality.





\section{Linear systems and their stability}


In the following let $A:D(A) \subset X\to X$ always be the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $T:=(T(t))_{t\geq 0}$ on $X$ with a nonempty resolvent set $\rho(A)$.
Recall that a semigroup $T$ is called analytic if $T$ extends to an analytic mapping $z\mapsto T(z)$ on a sector $S_{\phi}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\colon \arg(z)<\phi\}$ for some $\phi\in(0,\pi/2]$ and $\lim_{z\to0, z\in S_{\theta}}T(z)x=x$ for all $x\in X$ and some $\theta\in (0,\phi)$.

For the rest of the paper, we will be interested in systems $\Sigma(A,B)$ given by abstract Cauchy problems of the form \begin{equation}
\label{eq:Linear_System}
\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t),\qquad t>0, \ x(0)=x_{0},
\end{equation}
where $A:D(A)\to X$ generates a $C_{0}$-semigroup $(T(t))_{t\ge0}$ and $B$ is an operator, which is possibly unbounded, acting on the input space $U$. 
The reason for allowing unbounded operators $B$ stems from the study of systems with boundary or point controls, e.g.\ \cite{JaZ12,TuW09}. Note that in contrast to the (in general unbounded) operator $A$, $B$ will always be defined on the ``full space'' $U$, and the ``unboundedness'' is only reflected in the norm on the image space. 
To clarify the precise assumptions on $B$, let us recall a solution concept for \eqref{eq:Linear_System}: Consider the function $x$ (formally) given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mild}
 x(t)=T(t)x_{0}+\int_{0}^{t}T(t-s)Bu(s)\mathrm{d}s,\qquad t\ge0,
\end{equation}
for any $x_{0}\in X$ and $u\in L_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1}(\R_{\ge0},U)$. If  $x$ maps $[0,\infty)$ to $X$, then we call $x$ the \emph{mild solution} of \eqref{eq:Linear_System}. 
If $B$ is a bounded operator in the sense that $B\in L(U,X)$, then \eqref{eq:mild} indeed defines such mild solution. 
For more general operators $B$, suitable properties are required, in particular such that the integral in \eqref{eq:mild} is well-defined in $X$ for all $t>0$ and inputs $u$ from a space of $U$-valued (equivalence classes of) functions such as $L^{q}(0,\infty;U)$.

  To do so, we will view the convergence of the integral in a weaker norm on $X$ as follows. Define the extrapolation space $X_{-1}$ as the completion of $X$ with respect to the norm 
$ \|x\|_{X_{-1}}:= \|(aI -A)^{-1}x\|_X$ for some $a \in \rho(A)$.
$X_{-1}$ is a Banach space (see \cite[Theorem 5.5, p. 126]{EnN00}) and different choices of $a \in \rho(A)$ generate equivalent norms on $X_{-1}$, see \cite[p. 129]{EnN00}.
As we know from the representation theorem \cite[Theorem 3.9]{Wei89b}, the input operator $B$ must satisfy the condition $B\in L(U,X_{-1})$ in order to give rise to a well-defined control system. 
Lifting of the state space $X$ to a larger space $X_{-1}$ is natural because the semigroup  $(T(t))_{t\ge 0}$ extends uniquely to a strongly continuous semigroup  $(T_{-1}(t))_{t\ge 0}$ on $X_{-1}$ whose generator $A_{-1}:X_{-1}\to X_{-1}$ is an extension of $A$ with $D(A_{-1}) = X$, see, e.g.,\ \cite[Section II.5]{EnN00}. If clear from the context, we may drop the subscript ``$-1$'' in our notation. 
Thus we may consider Equation \eqref{eq:Linear_System} on the Banach space $X_{-1}$ by replacing $A$ by $A_{-1}$ and henceforth interpret \eqref{eq:mild} in $X_{-1}$ as the integral exists in $X_{-1}$ when the extension of the semigroup is considered. The standing assumption for systems $\Sigma(A,B)$ is thus that $B\in L(U,X_{-1})$ and where $X$ and $U$ are general Banach spaces. The lifting comes however at a price that $x$ has values in $X_{-1}$ in general. 

This motivates the following definition: 
\begin{definition}
\label{def:q-admissibility} 
The operator $B\in L(U,X_{-1})$ is called a {\em $q$-admissible control operator} for $(T(t))_{t\ge 0}$, where $1\le q\le \infty$, if for all $t\geq 0$ and $u\in L^q([0,t],U)$, it holds that
%there is a $t>0$ so that
\begin{eqnarray}
 \int_0^t T_{-1}(t-s)Bu(s)ds\in X.
\label{eq:q-admissibility}
\end{eqnarray}
If the analogous property holds for continuous functions $u\in C([0,t],U)$, we say that $B$ is $C$-admissible. 
\end{definition}
If $B$ is $q$-admissible, then $x$ defined by \eqref{eq:mild} is indeed a mild solution of \eqref{eq:Linear_System}.
Note that $q$-admissibility of $B$ w.r.t. $A$ means precisely the forward-completeness of $\Sigma(A,B)$ for all inputs from $L^q$.
It is easy to see that any mild solution is continuous if $B$ is $q$-admissible for $q<\infty$, see \cite[Proposition 2.3]{Wei89b}. In the critical case $q=\infty$, this is also known in many (practically relevant) situations, see e.g.\ \cite{JNP18,JSZ17}, but not entirely clear in general. 



For linear systems with  admissible $B$, we study the following stability notions.
\begin{definition}
System $\Sigma(A,B)$ is called {\em $L^p$-input-to-state stable (ISS)}, if there exist functions $\beta\in \mathcal{KL}$ and $ \mu\in {\mathcal K}_\infty$ such that for every $x_0\in X$, every $t\ge 0$ and every $u\in L^p(0,t;U)$,

 the mild solution  of \eqref{eq:Linear_System} $x$ satisfies $x(t)\in X$ and 
\begin{equation}\label{eqnISSCb}
\left\| x(t)\right\| \le \beta(\|x_0\|,t)+  \mu (\|u\|_{L^p(0,t)}).
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

ISS of \eqref{eq:Linear_System} can be characterized as follows, see \cite[Proposition 2.10]{JNP18}:
\begin{proposition}
\label{thm:ISS-Criterion-lin-sys-with-unbounded-operators}
Let $p\in[1,+\infty]$. 
The following properties are equivalent.  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] $\Sigma(A,B)$ is $L^p$-ISS
    \item[(ii)] $A$ generates an exponentially stable semigroup  and $B$ is $p$-admissible.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}




\begin{definition}[ISS Lyapunov function]
\label{def:ISS Lyapunov function}
Consider $\Sigma(A,B)$ and suppose that $B$ is $\infty$-admissible.
A continuous function $V:X\to \Rpn$ is called {a {\em (non-coercive) ISS Lyapunov function}} for $\Sigma(A,B)$ if there exist $\alpha_{2}\in \mathcal{K}$ and $\sigma\in \mathcal{K}_{\infty}$ such that 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:one-sided-sandwich}
0 < V(x_{0})\leq{}& \alpha_{2}(\|x_{0}\|),\quad  x_0\neq 0,
\end{align}
and for all $x_{0}\in X$ and all $u\in L_{loc}^{\infty}(0,\infty;U)$,
\begin{align}
\dot{V}_{u}(x_{0})\leq{}& - \alpha_{3}(\|x_{0}\|) + \sigma(\limsup_{t\to 0^{+}}\|u\|_{L^{\infty}(0,t)}),\label{eq:ISSLF2}
\end{align}
where $\dot{V}_{u}(x_{0})$ is the right-hand Dini derivative of $V(x(\cdot))$ at $t=0$:
\[
\dot{V}_{u}(x_{0}):=\limsup_{h\to0^{+}}\frac{1}{h}\big(V(x(h))-V(x_{0})\big)
\]
and $x(\cdot)$ is the mild solution \eqref{eq:mild} of \eqref{eq:Linear_System} with initial condition $x_0$ and input $u$. 

An ISS Lyapunov function is called {\em coercive} if there exists  $\alpha_{1}\in\mathcal{K}_\infty$ such that 
 \begin{equation*}
 \alpha_{1}(\|x\|)\leq V(x), \qquad x\in X.
 \end{equation*}
The function $V$ is simply called {\em Lyapunov function} {(for the uncontrolled system \eqref{eq:Linear_System})} if $V$ is an ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,0)$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Quadratic Lyapunov function] 
\label{def:Quadratic-LF}
Let $X$ be a Hilbert space. 
An ISS Lyapunov function $V:X\to \Rpn$ is called a \emph{quadratic ISS Lyapunov function}  if there exists a self-adjoint operator $P\in L(X)$ such that $V(x)=\langle Px,x\rangle$ for all $x\in X$. In this case, we also say that \emph{$V$ is quadratic}. 
\end{definition}
%\amc{For the definition of quadratic Lyapunov functions \fsc{we use the notation that a} bounded operator $P$ is positive if $P$ is self-adjoint and $\langle Px,x\rangle > 0$ for all $x\in X\backslash\{0\}$.}
We call a bounded, self-adjoint operator $P$  positive if $\langle Px,x\rangle > 0$ for all $x\in X\setminus\{0\}$.
Clearly, if $V: x \mapsto \langle Px,x\rangle$ is a quadratic Lyapunov function, then $P$ is positive. Furthermore, $P$ is invertible (with a bounded inverse) if and only if $V$ is coercive. 


Classical constructions of Lyapunov functions via solution of the Lyapunov operator equation, see e.g.~\cite[Theorem 4.1.3]{CuZ20}, lead to quadratic Lyapunov functions. On the other hand, quadratic Lyapunov functions can be easily differentiated, and there are efficient numerical schemes for construction of quadratic Lyapunov functions, as sum of squares (SoS) method.


The following characterization is elementary, but motivates how to define quadratic Lyapunov functions for general Banach spaces.
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:Characterization-quadratic-LFs} 
Let $X$ be a Hilbert space. An ISS Lyapunov function $V:X\to \Rpn$ is a quadratic ISS Lyapunov function if and only if there exists $F\in L(X)$ such that  
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:quadratic-Banach}
V(x)=\|Fx\|^2,\qquad\text{ for all }x\in X.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $V$ be a quadratic ISS Lyapunov function, i.e.\ $V(x)=\langle Px,x\rangle$, for all $x\in X$, for some self-adjoint, positive $P$.
Since $P^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is well-defined, self-adjoint and positive, see e.g. \cite[Theorem 12.3.4]{TuW09}, we conclude that $V(x)=\|P^{\frac{1}{2}}x\|^2$ for all $x\in X$. 

Conversely, let $V$ be an ISS Lyapunov function such that there is $F\in L(X)$ with  $V(x)=\|Fx\|^2$ for all $x\in X$. 
Then 
\[
0< V(x) = \langle Fx,Fx\rangle = \langle F^*Fx,x\rangle,\quad x\neq 0,
\]
and thus $P=F^*F$ is self-adjoint and positive, and hence $V$ is a quadratic ISS Lyapunov function.
\end{proof}


In view of Proposition~\ref{prop:Characterization-quadratic-LFs}, in the Banach space setting, we will call functions $V$ as in \eqref{eq:quadratic-Banach} quadratic ISS Lyapunov functions.

The use of $\mathcal{K}$-functions in the definition of ISS Lyapunov functions is natural in the view of nonlinear systems. 
It is not surprising that for quadratic Lyapunov functions there is no need to consider general comparison functions.


\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:quadratic}
Let $X$ be a Hilbert space. Let $V:X\to \Rpn$ be a coercive, quadratic ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,B)$ with $\infty$-admissible $B$ and with $\sigma(r)=a_4r^2$ in \eqref{eq:ISSLF2} for some $a_{4}>0$. Then there exist constants $a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}>0$ such that 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:quadratic-sandwich}
a_{1}\|x\|^{2}\leq V(x)\leq a_{2}\|x\|^{2},\qquad x\in X,
\end{equation}
and for all $u\in L^\infty(\Rpn,U)$ we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:quadratic-decay}
\dot{V}_{u}(x) \leq -a_3 \|x\|^{2} + a_4 (\limsup_{t\to 0^{+}}\|u\|_{L^{\infty}(0,t)})^2,\quad x\in X.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $V$ be a quadratic ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,B)$ with $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$ as in Definition~\ref{def:ISS Lyapunov function}.
Then $V(x) = V(\frac{x}{\|x\|})\|x\|^2$ for $x\neq 0$ and 
\[
a_1:=\alpha_1(1) \leq V\Big(\frac{x}{\|x\|}\Big)\leq \alpha_2(1)=:a_2.
\]
For $x \in X$, $x\neq 0$, and any $u\in L^\infty(\Rpn,U)$, we compute using joint linearity of the flow 
$\phi$ with respect to $x$, and $u$, that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot{V}_{u}(x) 
& = & \limsup_{t\to 0^{+}}\frac{V(\phi(t,x,u)) - V(x)}{t}\\
& = & \limsup_{t\to 0^{+}}\frac{V\Big(\phi\big(t,\|x\|\frac{x}{\|x\|},\|x\|\frac{u}{\|x\|}\big)\Big) - V\big(\|x\|\frac{x}{\|x\|}\big)}{t}\\
& = & \|x\|^2\limsup_{t\to 0^{+}}\frac{ V\Big(\phi\big(t,\frac{x}{\|x\|},\frac{u}{\|x\|}\big)\Big) - V\big(\frac{x}{\|x\|}\big)}{t}\\
& \leq & \|x\|^2\Big(-\alpha_3(1) + \frac{a_4}{\|x\|^2} \big(\limsup_{t\to 0^{+}}\|u\|_{L^{\infty}(0,t)}\big)^2 \Big)\\
& = & -\alpha_3(1)\|x\|^2 + a_4 \big(\limsup_{t\to 0^{+}}\|u\|_{L^{\infty}(0,t)}\big)^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof}


ISS Lyapunov functions as defined above, are of virtue to study $L^\infty$-ISS. For the analysis of $L^p$-ISS, another type of ISS Lyapunov functions is needed.

\begin{definition}[(Quadratic) $L^p$-ISS Lyapunov function]
\label{def:L2-ISS Lyapunov function}\-
%Let $X$ be a Banach space and $V:X\to \Rpn$ be continuous. 
Let $p\in[1,\infty)$ and let $\Sigma(A,B)$ be a system with $C$-admissible $B\in L(U,X_{-1})$. A continuous function $V:X\to \Rpn$  is called {a {\em (non-coercive) $L^p$-ISS Lyapunov function}} for $\Sigma(A,B)$  if there is $\alpha_2\in \mathcal{K}_{\infty}$ such that \eqref{eq:one-sided-sandwich} holds, and there exist constants $a_{3},a_4>0$ such that 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:quadratic-decay-L2-ISS}
\dot{V}_{u}(x) \leq -a_3 \|x\|^{2} + a_4\|u(0)\|^p_U,
\end{equation}
 for all $x \in X$ and all $u\in C(\Rpn,U)$. 
If there exists an (injective) operator $F \in L(X)$ such that \eqref{eq:quadratic-Banach} holds, we say that $V$ is a \emph{quadratic $L^p$-ISS Lyapunov function}, which is called \emph{coercive} if additionally \eqref{eq:quadratic-sandwich} is satisfied for some $a_1,a_2>0$.
\end{definition}
We emphasize the difference between the notions of \emph{ISS Lyapunov function} and \emph{$L^{p}$-ISS Lyapunov function}.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:L2-ISS-Lyapunov-suff-cond} 
If $B$ is $C$-admissible and there is a coercive quadratic $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for  $\Sigma(A,B)$, then  $\Sigma(A,B)$ is $L^p$-ISS for all $p\in[2,+\infty]$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
As the flow $\phi$ of $\Sigma(A,B)$ depends continuously on inputs, the claim follows from \cite[Theorem 1]{Mir20}, where using nonlinear rescaling of $V$, an explicit construction of the (non-quadratic) $L^q$-ISS Lyapunov functions was provided, for all $q\in(2,+\infty)$. The case $p=\infty$ directly follows from Proposition \ref{thm:ISS-Criterion-lin-sys-with-unbounded-operators}.
\end{proof}

Next we show that $L^p$-ISS Lyapunov functions for linear systems cannot be quadratic unless $p=2$.
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:Restrictions-quadratic-LFs} 
Let $V$ be a (coercive or non-coercive) quadratic $L^p$-ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,B)$ with $B\neq 0$ and $p\in[1,+\infty)$. Then $p=2$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By definition, there exists $a \geq 0$ such that
\[
\dot{V}_{u}(0) \leq a\|u(0)\|^p_U,\quad u\in C(\Rpn,U).
\]
Take $a_m$ as the infimum of $a>0$ satisfying the previous property. 
As $B\neq 0$, $a_m>0$. By the linearity of the flow $\phi$ in $u$, and as $V$ is quadratic, we see that for any $u\in C(\Rpn,U)$, and any $c>0$
\begin{align*}
%\label{eq:}
\dot{V}_{cu}(0) 
&= \limsup_{h\to +0}\frac{V(\phi(h,0,cu))}{h} = c^2\limsup_{h\to +0}\frac{V(\phi(h,0,u))}{h}\\
&\leq c^2 a_m\|u(0)\|^p_U = c^{2-p} a_m\|cu(0)\|^p_U,
\end{align*}
and taking $c>1$ for $p>2$ and $c<1$ for $p<2$, we come to a contradiction to the choice of $a_m$.
\end{proof}

As a corollary of Lemma~\ref{lem:quadratic}, we obtain 
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:Linfty-ISS-Lyapunov-fun-and-L2-ISS-Lf}
Consider a system $\Sigma(A,B)$ with $C$-admissible $B$.
Let $V$ is a quadratic ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,B)$ with $\sigma(r)=ar^2$ for some $a>0$. 
Then $V$ is an $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function.
\end{proposition}








\section{Upgrading quadratic Lyapunov functions to $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov functions}

In the sequel, it will be of interest for us under which conditions a quadratic Lyapunov function for the undisturbed system $\Sigma(A,0)$ is also an $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for the system $\Sigma(A,B)$. 
Here, we show several results of this kind.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:quadratic-ISS-LFs-with-inputs-Banach} 
Let $X$ be a Banach space and let $V:X \to \Rpn$ be a quadratic (coercive or non-coercive) Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,0)$ with $V(x) = \|Fx\|^2$ for a certain $F\in L(X)$ and all $x\in X$. Assume that $B \in L(U,X_{-1})$ is C-admissible and that there exists $C>0$ such that for each $u \in C(\Rpn,U)$
\begin{eqnarray}
\limsup_{t\to +0}\frac{1}{t}\Big\|F\int_{0}^{t}T_{-1}(t-s)Bu(s)\mathrm{d}s\Big\| \leq C \|u(0)\|_{U}.
\label{eq:Requirement-on-B}
\end{eqnarray}
Then $V$ is a quadratic (coercive or non-coercive respectively) $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,B)$. In particular, \eqref{eq:Requirement-on-B} holds for $B\in L(U,X)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For any $x \in X$ and $u\in C(\Rpn,U)$ we have by triangle inequality
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{t}\Big[&\Big\|F\Big(T(t)x+\int_{0}^{t}T_{-1}(t-s)Bu(s)\mathrm{d}s\Big)\Big\|^2 - \|Fx\|^2 \Big] \nonumber\\
&\leq   \frac{1}{t}\Big[\|FT(t)x\|^2 - \|Fx\|^2\Big] + \frac{1}{t}\Big\|F\int_{0}^{t}T_{-1}(t-s)Bu(s)\mathrm{d}s\Big\|^2 \nonumber\\
&+ \frac{2}{t}\|FT(t)x\| \Big\|F\int_{0}^{t}T_{-1}(t-s)Bu(s)\mathrm{d}s\Big\|.
\label{eq:aux-quadratic-ISS-LF}
\end{align}
Taking the limit $t\to+0$, using that
\[
\limsup_{h\to0^{+}} \frac{\|FT(t)x\|^2 - \|Fx\|^2}{t} 
= \dot{V}_{u=0}(x),
\]
and exploiting the property \eqref{eq:Requirement-on-B}, we obtain that 
\begin{align*}
\dot{V}_u(x) &=\limsup_{t\to0{+}}\frac{1}{t}\Big[\Big\|F\Big(T(t)x+\int_{0}^{t}T_{-1}(t-s)Bu(s)\mathrm{d}s\Big)\Big\|^2 - \|Fx\|^2 \Big]\\
&\leq  \dot{V}_{u=0}(x) + 2\|Fx\| C \|u(0)\|_{U}.
\end{align*}
In view of Lemma~\ref{lem:quadratic},  the decay rate of quadratic Lyapunov functions is quadratic, that is there is $a_3>0$ such that 
\begin{align*}
\dot{V}_u(x) 
&\leq  -a_3 \|x\|^2 + 2 \|x\| \|F\| C \|u(0)\|_{U}.
\end{align*}
Using Young's inequality, we obtain for any $\varepsilon>0$ that 
\begin{align*}
\dot{V}_u(x) 
&\leq  -a_3 \|x\|^2 + \varepsilon \|x\|^2  + \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \|F\|^2 C^2\|u(0)\|_{U}^2,
\end{align*}
and choosing $\varepsilon \in (0,a_3)$, we see that $V$ is a quadratic $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,B)$.

If $B\in L(U,X)$, then \eqref{eq:Requirement-on-B} follows since for any $u\in C(\Rpn,U)$,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow +0} \frac{1}{h} \int_0^h{T(h-r)B u(r)dr} = B u(0), 
%\label{eq:Convolution_Bu0}
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof}

We note that condition \eqref{eq:Requirement-on-B} nearly implies boundedness of $B$ if the Lyapunov function is coercive, i.e.\ $F$ is boundedly invertible. Indeed, in that case it can be  easily shown that $B$ is $L^{1}$-admissible, which is known to imply that $B\in L(U,X)$ if $X$ is reflexive, \cite{Wei89b}.


\section{Coercive quadratic Lyapunov functions for linear systems with bounded input operators}
\label{sec:Coercive quadratic Lyapunov functions for linear systems with bounded input operators}

Importance of Lyapunov functions is due to the fact, that they are certificates for important stability properties. As we are interested in this note in ISS, we recall the following result from \cite[Theorem 8]{MiW17c}:
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:Lyapunov-criterion-for-ISS-bounded-operators} 
Let $X$ be a Hilbert space, $A$ be the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup and $B\in L(U,X)$.
The following statements are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] \eqref{eq:Linear_System} is $L^p$-ISS for some $p\in [1,+\infty]$.
	\item[(ii)] \eqref{eq:Linear_System} is $L^p$-ISS for all $p\in [1,+\infty]$.
	\item[(iii)] There is a coercive $L^1$-ISS Lyapunov function for \eqref{eq:Linear_System}, which is an equivalent norm on $X$.
	\item[(iv)] There is a non-coercive quadratic $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for \eqref{eq:Linear_System}.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
Coercive $L^1$-ISS Lyapunov functions constructed in the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:Lyapunov-criterion-for-ISS-bounded-operators} in \cite{MiW17c} to show the equivalence between (i) and (iii) are never quadratic. In fact, they are norms on $X$, equivalent to 
$\|\cdot\|$, and thus they are homogeneous of degree one. 
In this section, we show a criterion for existence of a quadratic coercive $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for linear systems with bounded input operators.


We say that a \emph{semigroup $T$ is similar to a contraction semigroup}, if there exists a boundedly invertible operator $S:X\to X$ so that $(ST(t)S^{-1})_{t\geq 0}$ is a contraction semigroup. 
 Furthermore, we call $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_{new}$ an \emph{equivalent scalar product} in $X$, if $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_{new}$ is a scalar product in $X$ that induces a norm $\|\cdot\|_{new} = \sqrt{\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_{new}}$, that is equivalent to the norm $\|\cdot\|$ in $X$. The following lemma is well-known and the proof is elementary using the Lumer--Phillips theorem. 




\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:Similar-to-contraction-andequivalent-scalp} 
Let $X$ be a Hilbert space, and $A$ be the generator of a $C_0$-semigroup $T$.
Then, $T$ is similar to a contraction semigroup if and only if there exists an equivalent scalar product $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_{new}$ in $X$ such that $A$ is dissipative, i.e.\ 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Re\langle Ax,x\rangle_{new}\leq 0\quad \forall x\in D(A).
\label{eq:dissipativity}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{lemma}


The following result settles existence of coercive, quadratic Lyapunov functions for systems with bounded $B$.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:Quad-coercive-nonanalytic-1} 
Let $X$ be a Hilbert space, $B\in L(U,X)$ and let $A$ generate an exponentially stable semigroup $T$ on $X$. The following statements are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item\label{thm:quad-coercivity-itm0} There is a coercive, quadratic $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for \eqref{eq:Linear_System}.
\item\label{thm:quad-coercivity-itm1} There is a coercive, quadratic Lyapunov function for \eqref{eq:Linear_System} with $B=0$.
\item\label{thm:quad-coercivity-itm20} There is an equivalent scalar product $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_{new}$ such that $A$ is dissipative, i.e.
\begin{eqnarray}
\Re\langle Ax,x\rangle_{new}\leq 0,\quad x\in D(A)
\label{eq:Dissipativity-equivalent-scalp}
\end{eqnarray} 
and $x\mapsto \scalp{x}{x}_{new} = \|x\|^2_{new}$ is a quadratic ISS Lyapunov function for \eqref{eq:Linear_System}.

\item\label{thm:quad-coercivity-itm2} There exists an equivalent scalar product $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_{new}$ such that $A$ is dissipative.

\item\label{thm:quad-coercivity-itm3} $T$ is similar to a contraction semigroup.

\item\label{thm:quad-coercivity-itm32} There is an equivalent norm in $X$ of the form $W(x) = \|Fx\|$, for $F \in L(X)$, such that $\dot{W}(x) \leq -W(x)$ for $B=0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm0} $\Iff$ \ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm1}. Follows by Proposition~\ref{prop:quadratic-ISS-LFs-with-inputs-Banach}.

\ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm1} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm20}. 
Assume that there exists a coercive, quadratic Lyapunov function $V:X\to \Rpn$. By Lemma \ref{lem:quadratic}, there exists a self-adjoint operator $P\in L(X)$ and constants $c_{1},c_{2}>0$ such that $V(x)=\langle Px,x\rangle$  and
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bounds-for-V-aux}
c_{1}\|x\|^{2}\leq \langle Px,x\rangle\leq c_{2}\|x\|^{2},\qquad x\in X.
\end{equation}
Thus, $\langle x,y\rangle_{new}:=\langle P^{\frac{1}{2}}x,P^{\frac{1}{2}}y\rangle$ defines a new scalar product with a norm $\|\cdot\|_{new}$ which is equivalent to $\|\cdot\|$. For any $x\in D(A)$, 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{h}\Big(V(T(h)x)-&V(x)\Big)={}\frac{1}{h}\Big(\langle T(h)x,Px\rangle-\langle x,Px\rangle\Big)\\{}&\to \langle Ax,Px\rangle = \langle Ax,x\rangle_{new} 
\ \text{ as } h\to 0^{+}.
\end{align*}
By the assumption that $V$ is a Lyapunov function, we conclude that $A$ is dissipative with respect to the new scalar product.

\ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm20} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm2}. Clear. 

\ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm2} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm1}. 
As $T$ is exponentially stable, and $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_{new}$  is an equivalent scalar product, 
$T$ is also exponentially stable in the new norm $\|\cdot\|_{new}$ and thus there exists a positive operator 
$\tilde{P}\in L(X)$ satisfying the inequality 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Re\langle Ax,Px\rangle_{new} \leq -\langle x,x \rangle_{new},\qquad \forall x\in D(A)
\label{eq:Lyapunov-ineq-new-scalp}
\end{eqnarray}
with $P:=\tilde{P}$. In view of \eqref{eq:Dissipativity-equivalent-scalp}, for every $\varepsilon>0$ the operator $P=\tilde{P}+\varepsilon I$ also solves \eqref{eq:Lyapunov-ineq-new-scalp}.
Obviously, $V:x\mapsto \langle Px,x\rangle$,  $x\in X$ is a coercive Lyapunov function.

\ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm2} $\Iff$ \ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm3}. Follows by Lemma~\ref{lem:Similar-to-contraction-andequivalent-scalp}. 

\ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm1} $\Iff$ \ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm32}.
 Let $V(x) = \|Fx\|^2$ be a coercive quadratic Lyapunov function for $B=0$ with a certain $F\in L(X)$. Define $W(x):=\sqrt{V(x)}=\|Fx\|$, $x \in X$.
As $V$ is coercive and quadratic, $W$ is an equivalent norm, and furthermore, for certain $a>0$ and all $x \neq 0$ we have that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot{W}(x) = \frac{1}{2 W(x)} \dot{V}(x) \le  - \frac{1}{2 W(x)} 2a V(x) =   -aW(x).
%\label{eq:}
\end{eqnarray*}
The converse implication is analogous.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{rem:Norms-as-LFs} 
By item (iii) of Proposition~\ref{prop:Lyapunov-criterion-for-ISS-bounded-operators}, for exponentially stable semigroups $T$, we can always find an equivalent norm, which is a Lyapunov function for an undisturbed system. However, it is in general not of the form $V(x)=\|Fx\|$ for a linear $F \in L(X)$. To have this additional property, we need to assume that the semigroup $T$ is similar to a contraction semigroup.
\end{remark}



Supported by Theorem~\ref{thm:Quad-coercive-nonanalytic-1}, we have the following negative result on existence of coercive quadratic Lyapunov functions for exponentially stable systems.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop1}
For any infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $X$ there exists a generator $A$ of an exponentially stable, analytic semigroup $T$ on $X$ such that the system $\Sigma(A,0)$ has no coercive, quadratic Lyapunov function.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Assume that there exists a coercive, quadratic Lyapunov function $V:X\to \Rpn$. 
By Theorem~\ref{thm:Quad-coercive-nonanalytic-1}, it follows that $A$ generates a semigroup, similar to a contraction semigroup.
However, for any infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, it is possible to construct analytic, exponentially stable semigroups, which are not similar to a contraction semigroup, see \cite[Theorem 1.1]{LeMerdy98}, and \cite{mcintoshHinfNo}, as well as \cite[Chapter 9, Theorem 9.17]{Haase06}. 
%\mir{More precise references?}
\end{proof}


\begin{remark}
\label{rem:Existence of a quadratic ISS LF} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Note that if one drops in Proposition~\ref{prop1} the condition that the semigroup generated by $A$ is analytic, then examples of semigroups not similar to a contraction semigroup were known for a while, \cite{Fogu69,Che76}. The fact that there exist such examples even for analytic semigroups is more subtle. In particular, the latter examples are rather pathologic in the sense that they do not emerge from pde examples.
\item
Combining Theorem~\ref{thm:Quad-coercive-nonanalytic-1} with Proposition~\ref{prop:Lyapunov-criterion-for-ISS-bounded-operators}, we obtain another negative result: Existence of a coercive ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,B)$ does not imply existence of a coercive quadratic ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,B)$ (in contrast to finite-dimensional linear case).
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}






Recall that for generator $A$ of an exponentially stable analytic semigroup, the operator $-A$ is sectorial (of angle less than $\pi/2$), see \cite{Haase06}. Thus the fractional power $(-A)^{{-\alpha}}$, $\alpha\in(0,1)$ can be defined as bounded operator via a contour integral of an operator-valued analytic function; this is an instance of the Riesz--Dunford functional calculus for sectorial operators. It can be shown that this operator is injective since $A$ is injective and hence $(-A)^{\alpha}$ can be defined as the inverse. The operator $(-A)^{\alpha}$ is closed and  densely defined. For more information on this construction see the books \cite{Haase06}  and  \cite[Section 1.4]{Hen81} and, for a very brief description of the essentials required here, \cite{Sch20}.

The following result provides an alternative construction of a coercive quadratic Lyapunov function for exponentially stable \emph{analytic} systems with bounded $B$. Recall that if $A$ generates an analytic semigroup $T$, then for any $x\in X$, $\beta:t\mapsto \|AT(t)x\|$ is dominated by a constant times $t^{-1}$.  However, if the semigroup is exponentially stable an $x\in D(A)$, then $\beta$ is integrable. 
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm1} 
Let $X$ be a Hilbert space, $B\in L(U,X)$ and let $A$ generate an exponentially stable analytic semigroup $T$ on $X$. The conditions \ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm0}--\ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm32} in Theorem~\ref{thm:Quad-coercive-nonanalytic-1} are equivalent to 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*), start = 7]
\item\label{thm:quad-coercivity-itm4} The function
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LFV}
V:D(A)\to \Rpn,\quad  x\mapsto \int_{0}^{\infty}\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t)x\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
extends to a coercive, quadratic {ISS} Lyapunov function from $X$ to $\Rpn$ for the system $\Sigma(A,B)$. We denote this extension again by $V$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}



\begin{proof} 
The implication \ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm4} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm1} is clear. It remains to show:
\ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm3} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{thm:quad-coercivity-itm4}. As $T$ is an analytic semigroup, for any $x \in X$ and any $t>0$ it holds that $T(t)x \in D(A)$, and as $D(A) \subset D((-A)^\frac{1}{2})$, the term $\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t)x\|^{2}$ is well-defined for any $t>0$. 
The fact that the integral in \eqref{eq:LFV} is well-defined is non-trivial and follows since $T$ is similar to a contraction semigroup, see e.g.\ \cite[Theorem 7.3.1]{Haase06} (with $f(z)=z^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{e}^{-z}$) together with \cite[Theorem 7.3.7]{Haase06}.
%\mir{I do not think that the previous line will be enough to see why this follows from cited results. Maybe expand this?} \fs{it follows exactly from those to theorems}
Moreover, by the same result, there exist constants $a_{1},a_{2}>0$ such that 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqthm1}
a_{1}\|x\|^{2}\leq V(x)\leq a_{2}\|x\|^{2},
\end{equation}
for all $x\in D(A)$. In other words, the linear mapping $x\mapsto (-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(\cdot)x$  from $D(A)$ to $L^{2}(0,\infty;X)$ is bounded and bounded from below. Since $D(A)$ is dense in $X$, there exists a unique bounded linear extension $Q$ from  $X$ to $L^{2}(0,\infty;X)$. Thus also $V$ has a continuous extension to $X$ such that \eqref{eqthm1} holds
for all $x\in X$. From now on let $V$ refer to this extension. To see that $V$ is indeed quadratic, one realizes that $V(x)=\|Qx\|^2=\langle Q^{*}Qx,x\rangle$.\\
It remains to show that $V$ satisfies property \eqref{eq:ISSLF2}.
We only focus on the case $u=0$ here, as the remaining argument is similar as in the proof of \cite[Proposition 6]{MiW17c}, but also uses the coercivity shown in the first part of this proof. Alternatively, the argument follows from the upcoming Theorem \ref{thm:Coercive-LFs-for-admissible-operators}. 
Setting $\tilde{V}(y)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\|T(t)y\|^{2}\mathrm{d}t$, we have that $$V(x)=\tilde{V}((-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}x),$$
for $x\in D((-A)^{\frac{1}{2}})$ since the fractional power commutes with the semigroup on its domain. 
By using  that $\tilde{V}$ is a (non-coercive) Lyapunov function, \cite[Proposition 6]{MiW17c}, and $(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t)x=T(t)(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}x$, it follows that for the mild solution $x$ of \eqref{eq:Linear_System},
\begin{align}
	\dot{V}_{u\equiv 0}(x)={}&\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\Big(\tilde{V}((-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}x(h))-\tilde{V}((-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}x)\Big)\nonumber\\
	={}&\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\Big(\tilde{V}\big(T(h)(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}x\big)-\tilde{V}((-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}x)\Big)\nonumber\\
	\lesssim{}&-\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}x\|^{2}\nonumber\\
	\leq{}&-\|(-A)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\|^{-2}\,\|x\|^{2}, 
	\label{eq:Vdot-estimate}  
\end{align}
where, in the last equation, we have used the fact that $(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is boundedly invertible. 
Using the same density argument as in Lemma~\ref{lem:quadratic}, one can show that \eqref{eq:Vdot-estimate} holds for all $x\in X$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{rem:LF-self-adjoint-case} 
The function $V$ defined in Theorem \ref{thm1} is a special instance of more general {\emph{square function estimates} (or quadratic estimates)} originating from harmonic analysis and omnipresent in the holomophic functional calculus, see \cite{Haase06}.

The Lyapunov function in \eqref{eq:LFV} takes a particularly simple form in case if $A$ is a self-adjoint operator. Using that $A$ and hence $T(t)$  and $(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ are self-adjoint, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V(x) = \scalp{\int_0^{+\infty}(-A)T(2t)x dt}{x} =\frac{1}{2}\scalp{x}{x}, 
\end{eqnarray*}
where $x\in D(A)$ and we used that the semigroup is exponentially stable. 

\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
\label{rem:JMP20-comparison} 
In \cite[Proposition 6.1]{JMP20} it was shown that a quite different construction of Lyapunov functions for exponentially stable systems with self-adjoint generator is possible: $W(x):=-\frac{1}{2}\scalp{A^{-1}x}{x}$. This distinctly non-coercive Lyapunov function is also a non-coercive ISS Lyapunov function for $A$ as above and any $\infty$-admissible input operator.
\end{remark}



\section{Coercive $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov functions for linear $L^2$-ISS systems}
\label{sec:coercive-L2-ISS-LFs}

By Proposition~\ref{prop:L2-ISS-Lyapunov-suff-cond} and Proposition~\ref{thm:ISS-Criterion-lin-sys-with-unbounded-operators},
the existence of a quadratic $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function implies 2-admissibility of $B$, for any system $\Sigma(A,B)$. 

In this section, we establish the converse results for analytic semigroups that are similar to contraction semigroups. 
The following lemma on sufficient conditions for admissibility of $B$ will be helpful on this way:
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:Sufficient-condition-for-admissibility} 
Let $A$ be an analytic semigroup over a Hilbert space $X$. Then 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item If $B \in L(U,X_{-\frac{1}{2}+p})$ for some $p\geq 0$, then $B$ is $q$-admissible for all $q \in (\frac{2}{1+2p},+\infty]$. In particular, if $p>0$, then $B$ is 2-admissible.
	\item If $A$ is self-adjoint, and $B \in L(U,X_{-\frac{1}{2}})$, then $B$ is 2-admissible.
	\item If $A$ is self-adjoint, and $B$ is 2-admissible, then $B$ does not necessarily satisfy the condition $B \in L(U,X_{-\frac{1}{2}})$.
	\item If $B$ is $q$-admissible for some $q<2$, then $B\in L(U,X_{-\gamma})$ for some $\gamma<\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assertion (i) follows  immediately e.g.\ from \cite[Proposition 2.13]{Sch20}.

Statement (ii) is immediate from \cite[Proposition 5.1.3]{TuW09} by duality of admissible control and observation operators. 

(iii): The claim follows from the following counterexample, which is a direct adaptation of \cite[Example~5.3.11]{TuW09} by duality.

Consider the state space $X = \ell_2$ of square summable real sequences, a diagonal operator $A = (-2^n)_{n\in\Z_+}$, and an input operator 
$B:\C\to X$, given by $Bc = (2^{n/2})_{n\in\Z_+}c$.
Then 
\[
(-A)^{-\frac{1}{2}}B = (1,1,1,\ldots),
\]
which is not a well-defined operator from $\C$ to $X$.

At the same time, $A$ is 2-admissible by an application of a Laplace--Carleson measure criterion, \cite[Thm.~3.2]{JPP14}.

However, $(-A)^{-p}B = (2^{(\frac{1}{2} - p)n})_{n\in\Z_+}$ is a bounded operator from $\C$ to $X$ for $p>\frac{1}{2}$.

(iv): This result is folklore known and follows, e.g., from \cite[Prop.~19]{MaraghBounit14}.
\end{proof}




We start with a converse coercive Lyapunov result for systems with self-adjoint generator.
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:Coercive-LF-Self-adjoint} 
Let $A=A^*$ be a self-adjoint operator, generating an exponentially stable semigroup $T$. Let further $B \in L(U,X_{-\frac{1}{2}})$.

Then
\begin{eqnarray}
V:x \mapsto \frac{1}{2}\|x\|^2,\quad x\in X
\label{eq:coercive-LF-self-adjoint-case}
\end{eqnarray}
is a coercive quadratic $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,B)$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:Sufficient-condition-for-admissibility}(ii), $B$ is 2-admissible, and thus in particular $C$-admissible. In view of Theorem~\ref{thm1}  and Remark~\ref{rem:LF-self-adjoint-case}, $V$ is a 
coercive quadratic Lyapunov function for the system $\Sigma(A,0)$. 


Now take any $x_{0} \in D(A)$ and any $u \in C_{loc}^{1}(\Rpn,U)$ with $u(0)=0$. Then the corresponding mild solution $x$ is even classical and we can differentiate the Lyapunov function along trajectories,
\[\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}V(x(t))=\langle \dot{x}(t),x(t)\rangle=\langle Ax(t),x(t)\rangle+\langle Bu(t),x(t)\rangle,\quad t>0,\]
where the last term has to be understood as duality bracket between $X_{-\frac{1}{2}}$ and $X_{\frac{1}{2}}\subset X_{1}$. Hence, the modules of that term can be bound from above by \[\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\|B\|_{L(U,X_{-1/2})}^{2}\|u(t)\|^{2}+\varepsilon^{2}\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}x(t)\|^{2},\quad \varepsilon>0.\]
By assumption $A$ is strictly dissipative in the sense that there exists a constant $a>0$ such that $-\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}x(t)\|^{2}=\langle Ax(t),x(t)\rangle\leq -a\|x(t)\|^{2}$.  Thus, choosing $\varepsilon$ sufficiently small yields
\[\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}V(x(t))\leq -\kappa V(x(t))+c\|u(t)\|^{2},\quad t>0,\]
for constants $\kappa,c>0$. Integrating the equation gives
\[ \|x(t)\|^{2}-\|x_{0}\|^{2}\leq -\kappa\int_{0}^{t}\|x(s)\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}s+c\int_{0}^{t}\|u(s)\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}s.\]
By the continuous dependence of $x$ on $x_{0}$ and $u$ in $X$ and $C_{loc}$, respectively, the last inequality extends to all $x_{0}\in X$ and $u\in C(\Rpn,U)$. By \cite[Cor. A.5.45]{CuZ20}, we conclude that the Dini derivative satisfies
\[\dot{V}_{u}(x)\leq -\kappa \|x\|^{2}+c\|u(0)\|^{2},\qquad x\in X, u\in C(\Rpn,U). \]

\end{proof}





\subsection{Analytic semigroups, coercive LFs}

Next we show the converse $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov theorem for linear systems governed by general analytic semigroups under a slightly stronger assumption on $B$.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:Coercive-LFs-for-admissible-operators} 
Let $X$ be a Hilbert space and let $A$ generate an exponentially stable analytic semigroup $T$ on $X$, which is similar to a contraction semigroup. Furthermore, let $B \in L(U,X_{-p})$ for some $p<\frac{1}{2}$. Then 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LFV-2}
V:D(A)\to \Rpn,\quad x\mapsto \int_{0}^{\infty}\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t)x\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
(extended to $X$) is a coercive quadratic $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for \eqref{eq:Linear_System}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:Sufficient-condition-for-admissibility}(i), $B$ is 2-admissible, and thus the system $\Sigma(A,B)$ is well-posed with input functions $L^2(\Rpn,U)$. 
By Theorem~\ref{thm1}, $V$ defined by \eqref{eq:LFV-2} is a coercive quadratic Lyapunov function for \eqref{eq:Linear_System} with $B=0$.

It remains to show the dissipation inequality for $B \in L(U,X_{-p})$ with $p < \frac{1}{2}$.
Pick any $u\in C(\Rpn,U)$, $h>0$, $x \in D(A)$ and consider 
\begin{align*}
V(\phi(h,x,u))
=& \int_{0}^{\infty}\Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t)\Big[T(h)x +  \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)ds\Big]\Big\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
=& \int_{0}^{\infty}\Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t+h)x +\\
&\qquad (-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t) \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)ds\Big\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
=& \int_{0}^{\infty}\big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t+h)x\|^2\,\mathrm{d}t +\\
& 2\int_{0}^{\infty}\Re \scalp{(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t+h)x}{(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t) \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)ds}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
&\qquad + \int_{0}^{\infty}\Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t) \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)ds\Big\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
\end{align*} 
These terms we denote by $I_1,I_2,I_3$ respectively.

Clearly, $I_1= V(T(h)x)$. 

\textbf{Estimate for $I_3$.}
Pick $\varepsilon>0$ such that $p+\varepsilon< \frac{1}{2}$, and thus $(-A)^\varepsilon B$ is a 2-admissible operator by \cite[Proposition 2.13]{Sch20}.
Furthermore, recall that fractional powers of $A$ commute with the semigroup.
Finally, as $(-A)^{\varepsilon}$ is a closed operator and the function $s \mapsto (-A)^{\varepsilon}T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)$ is Bochner integrable, by \cite[Proposition 1.1.7]{ABH11}, we can switch $(-A)^{\varepsilon}$ and the integral sign to obtain

\begin{align*}
I_3 
&=    \int_{0}^{\infty}\Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon}T(t) \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)(-A)^{\varepsilon}Bu(s)ds\Big\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
&\leq    \int_{0}^{\infty}\big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon}T(t)\big\|^2\,\mathrm{d}t 
\Big\| \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)(-A)^{\varepsilon}Bu(s)ds\Big\|^{2}.
\end{align*} 
As $A$ generates an analytic exponentially stable semigroup, it holds that $\big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon}T(t)\big\| \leq \frac{M}{t^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon}}e^{-\delta t}$ for certain $M,\delta>0$, and all $t>0$, and hence 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Analytic-convergence}
\int_{0}^{\infty}\big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon}T(t)\big\|^2\,\mathrm{d}t  =: K<\infty.
\end{align}
By 2-admissibility of $(-A)^{\varepsilon}B$, we obtain for a certain $K_2>0$ that 
\begin{align*}
I_3 \leq K_2 \int_0^h \|u(s)\|^2 ds.
\end{align*} 

\textbf{Estimate for $I_2$.} 
Interchanging the scalar product with the integration, and using that the semigroup commutes with the fractional powers of a generator, we proceed to
\begin{align*}
I_2
&= 2\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_0^h \Re \scalp{(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t+h)x}{(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(t)  T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)ds}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
&= 2\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_0^h \Re 
\lel {T(t)(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(h)x}\right.,\\
&\left.(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}T\Big(\frac{t}{2}\Big)(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}T\Big(\frac{t}{2}\Big)  T_{-1}(h-s)(-A)^{-\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}Bu(s)\rir ds \,\mathrm{d}t\\
\end{align*} 
By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and using the uniform boundedness of a semigroup (which follows from its exponential stability), we have for a certain $C_1>0$ that
\begin{align*}
I_2
&\leq 2\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_0^h 
 \|T(t)\|  \|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(h)x\| \Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}T\Big(\frac{t}{2}\Big)\Big\| \\
&\cdot \Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}T\Big(\frac{t}{2}\Big)\Big\|
 \| T_{-1}(h-s)\| \|(-A)^{-\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}B\| \|u(s)\| ds \,\mathrm{d}t\\
&\leq C_1\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_0^h 
  \|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(h)x\| \Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}T\Big(\frac{t}{2}\Big)\Big\| \\
&\qquad\qquad\qquad\cdot \Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}T\Big(\frac{t}{2}\Big)\Big\| \|u(s)\| ds \,\mathrm{d}t
\end{align*} 
Using Young's inequality for the expression under the integral sign, we have for any $\delta>0$ that 
\begin{align*}
I_2
&\leq C_1\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_0^h 
  \delta\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(h)x\|^2 \Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}T\Big(\frac{t}{2}\Big)\Big\|^2ds \,\mathrm{d}t \\
&\qquad\qquad + C_1\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_0^h \frac{1}{4\delta}\Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}T\Big(\frac{t}{2}\Big)\Big\|^2 \|u(s)\|^2 ds \,\mathrm{d}t\\
&= C_1\delta \int_{0}^{\infty}\Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}T\Big(\frac{t}{2}\Big)\Big\|^2 \,\mathrm{d}t 
\cdot \int_0^h \|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(h)x\|^2 ds \\
& + \frac{C_1}{4\delta} \int_{0}^{\infty} \Big\|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}T\Big(\frac{t}{2}\Big)\Big\|^2 \,\mathrm{d}t 
\int_0^h\|u(s)\|^2 ds.
\end{align*} 
Now using \eqref{eq:Analytic-convergence} we have with a new constant $C_2$ that
\begin{align*}
I_2
&\leq C_2\delta  \int_0^h \|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(h-s)T(s)x\|^2 ds + \frac{C_2}{4\delta} \int_0^h\|u(s)\|^2 ds\\
&= C_2\delta  \int_0^h \|T(h-s)(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(s)x\|^2 ds + \frac{C_2}{4\delta} \int_0^h\|u(s)\|^2 ds\\
&\leq C_3\delta  \int_0^h \|(-A)^{\frac{1}{2}}T(s)x\|^2 ds + \frac{C_3}{4\delta} \int_0^h\|u(s)\|^2 ds,
\end{align*} 
where we again used boundedness of the semigroup and taken a new constant $C_3>C_2$.

Finally, representing the first integral via our Lyapunov function, we obtain the following estimate for $I_2$:
\begin{align*}
I_2
&\leq C_3\delta \big(V(x) - V(T(h)x)\big) + \frac{C_3}{4\delta} \int_0^h\|u(s)\|^2 ds.
\end{align*} 

\textbf{Dissipativity estimate.}
Having finished the estimates of the terms $I_1,\ I_2,\ I_3$, we can compute the Dini derivative of $V$ along the trajectory:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:LieDerivative-1}
\dot{V}_u(x) 
&= \limsup_{h\to+0}\frac{V(\phi(h,x,u)) - V(x)}{h}\nonumber\\
&\leq \limsup_{h\to+0}\Big[\frac{V(T(h)x) - V(x)}{h} + \frac{K_2}{h}\int_0^h \|u(s)\|^2 ds\nonumber\\
&\qquad+ C_3\delta \frac{V(x) - V(T(h)x)}{h} + \frac{C_3}{4\delta h} \int_0^h\|u(s)\|^2 ds\Big].
\end{align}

By Lemma~\ref{lem:quadratic}, the following holds for a certain $a>0$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:quadratic-decay-aux}
\dot{V}_{u=0}(x) = \lim_{h\to+0}\frac{V(T(h)x)-V(x)}{h} \leq -a \|x\|^{2},\qquad x\in X.
\end{equation}
Using this estimate, taking $\delta$ small enough and recalling that $u$ is continuous, we can compute the limit in the estimate 
\eqref{eq:LieDerivative-1}.
Thus, we finally obtain for certain $a_1,a_2>0$, all $x \in D(A)$ and all $u\in C(\Rpn,U)$ that 

\begin{align}
\label{eq:LieDerivative-2}
\dot{V}_u(x) &\leq - a_1\|x\|^2 + a_2\|u(s)\|^2 .
\end{align}
By density argument, we obtain that $V$ is an $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for $\Sigma(A,B)$.
\end{proof}





\section{Non-coercive quadratic ISS Lyapunov functions for analytic systems}
\label{sec:Non-coercive quadratic ISS Lyapunov functions for analytic systems}

Here we adapt the construction \eqref{eq:LFV-2} to obtain a family of non-coercive Lyapunov functions.
This result shows that there is a transition from the non-coercive case ($q=0$) to the coercive case ($q=1/2$ and under the additional assumption that $X$ is a Hilbert space and the semigroup is similar to a contraction). 

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:Non-Coercive-LFs-for-analytic-sgr} 
Let $X$ be a Banach space, and let $A$ generate an exponentially stable analytic semigroup $T$ on $X$.
 Furthermore, let $B \in L(U,X_{-p})$ for some $p \in [0,1)$. Then for a $q\geq 0$ the function
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LFV-mit-q}
\hspace{-3mm}W_q(x) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\|(-A)^{q}T(t)x\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t,\quad x \in X
\end{equation}
is a non-coercive $L^2$-ISS quadratic Lyapunov function for \eqref{eq:Linear_System} provided $p+2q<1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Well-posedness and bounds.}
 As $A$ generates an analytic exponentially stable semigroup, for any $r>0$ there are $M,\delta>0$ such that 
\begin{eqnarray}
\big\|(-A)^{r}T(t)\big\| \leq \frac{M}{t^{r}}e^{-\delta t},\quad t>0.
\label{eq:Fractional-powers-analytic-semigroup}
\end{eqnarray}
As $T$ is analytic, for all $x \in X$ and all $t>0$ we have $T(t)x \in D(A)$, the term $(-A)^{q}T(t)x$ is well-defined for $t>0$ and all $x \in X$.

With \eqref{eq:Fractional-powers-analytic-semigroup} in mind and since by assumption $2q<1$, we see that
$t\mapsto \|(-A)^{q}T(t)x\|^{2}$ is integrable for each $x \in X$, i.e. $W_q$ is well-defined on $X$, and furthermore 
\begin{eqnarray}
W_q(x) \leq \int_{0}^{\infty}\|(-A)^{q}T(t)\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t \|x\|^2 =: C \|x\|^2,
\label{eq:W_q-upper-bound}
\end{eqnarray}
for all $x \in X$ with a uniform finite $C$. Clearly, $W_q(x)\geq 0$ for all $x \in X$.
As $0 \in \rho(A)$, $(-A)^q$ is boundedly invertible, and from this fact it is easy to see that $W_q(x)>0$ for $x\neq 0$.

The proof that $W_q$ is quadratic is as in Theorem~\ref{thm1}.

\textbf{Dissipative estimate.} Pick any $u\in C(\Rpn,U)$ and $x \in X$.
As $B \in L(U,X_{-p})$, $B$ is $\infty$-admissible by \cite[Proposition 2.13]{Sch20}, and hence the solution $\phi(\cdot,x,u)$ exists globally.
Now take any $h>0$ and consider 
\begin{align*}
W_q(&\phi(h,x,u))\\
=& \int_{0}^{\infty}\Big\|(-A)^{q}T(t)\Big[T(h)x +  \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)ds\Big]\Big\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
=& \int_{0}^{\infty}\Big\|(-A)^{q}T(t+h)x +\\
&\qquad (-A)^{q}T(t) \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)ds\Big\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
\leq& \int_{0}^{\infty}\big\|(-A)^{q}T(t+h)x\big\|^2\,\mathrm{d}t +\\
& 2\int_{0}^{\infty}\big\|(-A)^{q}T(t+h)x\big\|\Big\|(-A)^{q}T(t) \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)ds\Big\|\,\mathrm{d}t\\
&\qquad + \int_{0}^{\infty}\Big\|(-A)^{q}T(t) \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)ds\Big\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t.
\end{align*} 
These terms we denote by $I_1,I_2,I_3$ respectively.

Clearly, $I_1= W_q(T(h)x)$. Let us estimate $I_2$.
Take $p\geq 0$ such that $B \in L(U,X_{-p})$, i.e., $(-A)^{-p}B \in L(U,X)$.

%\todo{Here at some points $(-A)^{p}$ are actually extensions of $(-A)^{p}$ to $X_{-1}$. Is it so clear?}

Recall that fractional powers of $A$ commute with the semigroup $T$.
As $(-A)^{p}$ is a closed operator and the maps $s \mapsto T_{-1}(h-s)(-A)^{-p}Bu(s)$ and $s \mapsto T_{-1}(h-s)Bu(s)$ are Bochner integrable in $X_{-1}$, by \cite[Proposition 1.1.7]{ABH11} we can switch $(-A)^{p}$ and the integral sign to obtain
\begin{align*}
I_2 
=  & 2\int_{0}^{\infty}\big\|(-A)^{q}T(t+h)x\|\Big\|(-A)^{q+p}T(t) \\
&\qquad\cdot\int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)(-A)^{-p}Bu(s)ds\Big\|\,\mathrm{d}t\\
\leq  & 
2\|T(h)x\| \int_{0}^{\infty}\big\|(-A)^{q}T(t)\|\big\|(-A)^{p+q}T(t)\big\| \,\mathrm{d}t \\
&\qquad \cdot \Big\|\int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)(-A)^{-p}Bu(s)ds\Big\|.
\end{align*}
By  \eqref{eq:Fractional-powers-analytic-semigroup} and thanks to $p+2q<1$, we obtain that  
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty}\big\|(-A)^{q}T(t)\|\big\|(-A)^{p+q}T(t)\big\| \,\mathrm{d}t < \infty.
\]
As $(-A)^{-p}B \in L(U,X)$, for a certain $K>0$ it holds that 
\begin{align*}
I_2 
\leq&  K \|T(h)x\| h \sup_{s\in[0,h]}\|u(s)\|.
\end{align*} 
To estimate $I_3$, note that 
as $p+2q<1$, then also $p+q<1$, and hence there is $p_1>0$ such that $p-p_1<\frac{1}{2}$ and $p_1+q < \frac{1}{2}$.

\begin{align*}
I_3 
=   & \int_{0}^{\infty}\Big\|(-A)^{p_1+q}T(t) \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)(-A)^{-p_1}Bu(s)ds\Big\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
\leq   & \int_{0}^{\infty}\big\|(-A)^{p_1+q}T(t)\big\|^2\,\mathrm{d}t 
\Big\| \int_0^h T_{-1}(h-s)(-A)^{-p_1}Bu(s)ds\Big\|^{2}.
\end{align*} 
As $p_1+q<\frac{1}{2}$, by \eqref{eq:Fractional-powers-analytic-semigroup} it holds that 
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty}\big\|(-A)^{p_1+q}T(t)\big\|^2\,\mathrm{d}t <\infty.
\]
Furthermore, as $(-A)^{-p}B = (-A)^{-(p-p_1)}(-A)^{-p_1}B$, and $p-p_1<\frac{1}{2}$, the operator $(-A)^{-p_1}B \in L(U,X_{-1+\alpha})$ with $\alpha=1-(p-p_1)>\frac{1}{2}$, and thus $(-A)^{-p_1}B$ is $L^2$-admissible by \cite[Proposition 2.13]{Sch20}.
Hence, for a certain $K_2>0$ it holds that 
\begin{align*}
I_3 \leq K_2 \int_0^h\|u(s)\|^2 ds.
\end{align*} 

Now we are able to compute the Lie derivative of $W_q$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{W}_{q,u}(x) &= & \limsup_{h\to 0}  \frac{1}{h}\big(W_q(\phi(t,x,u))-W_q(x)\big)\nonumber\\
&\leq&  \limsup_{h\to 0} \Big[\frac{1}{h}\big(W_q(T(h)x)-W_q(x)\big)\nonumber\\
&& + K \|T(h)x\| \sup_{s\in[0,h]}\|u(s)\| + K_2 \frac{1}{h}\int_0^h\|u(s)\|^2 ds\Big].
\label{eq:Analytic-non-coercive-Lie-der}
\end{eqnarray}
It holds that 
\begin{align*}
W_q(T&(h)x)-W_q(x) \\
&= 
\int_{0}^{\infty}\|(-A)^{q}T(t+h)x\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t
-
\int_{0}^{\infty}\|(-A)^{q}T(t)x\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
&=
\int_{h}^{\infty}\|(-A)^{q}T(t)x\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t
-
\int_{0}^{\infty}\|(-A)^{q}T(t)x\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
&=
-
\int_{0}^{h}\|(-A)^{q}T(t)x\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t.
\end{align*}
Thus for $x \in D(A)$ wer have using the commutativity of $T(t)$ and $(-A)^{q}$:  
\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot{W}_{q,0}(x) &=& \limsup_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}\big(W_q(T(h)x)-W_q(x) \big) \\
&= & -\limsup_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h} \int_{0}^{h}\|T(t)(-A)^{q}x\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t\\
&= & -\|(-A)^{q}x\|^{2},
\end{eqnarray*}
and since $(-A)^{q}$ is boundedly invertible, it holds that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot{W}_{q,0}(x) &\leq& -\|(-A)^{-q}\|^{-2}\|x\|^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
By density, this holds for all $x \in X$.
Using this in \eqref{eq:Analytic-non-coercive-Lie-der}, and since $\frac{1}{h}\int_0^h\|u(s)\|^2 ds \to \|u(0)\|^2$ as $h\to +0$ for continuous $u$, we obtain that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot{W}_{q,u}(x) &\leq & -\|(-A)^{-q}\|^{-2}\|x\|^2 + K \|x\| \|u(0)\| + K_2\|u(0)\|^2.
%\label{eq:Analytic-non-coercive-Lie-der-2}
\end{eqnarray*}
Using Young's inequality for the second term, we obtain finally for a small enough $\varepsilon>0$ and corresponding $K_3(\varepsilon)>0$ that 
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{W}_{q,u}(x) &\leq & -\big(\|(-A)^{-q}\|^{-2}-\varepsilon\big)\|x\|^2 + K_3(\varepsilon)\|u(0)\|^2,
\label{eq:Analytic-non-coercive-Lie-der-3}
\end{eqnarray}
which shows that $W_q$ is a non-coercive $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for \eqref{eq:Linear_System}.
\end{proof}

As a corollary we obtain that if $B$ is slightly better than $\infty$-admissible, and the semigroup is analytic, then there is also an $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function.

\begin{theorem}
Let $X$ be a Banach space, and let $A$ generate an exponentially stable analytic semigroup $T$ on $X$.
 Furthermore, let $(-A)^{-p}B \in L(U,X)$ for some $p<1$. Then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LFV-non-coercive-special}
\hspace{-3mm}W(x) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\|T(t)x\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t,\quad x \in X
\end{equation}
is a non-coercive $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for \eqref{eq:Linear_System}.
\end{theorem}

















\section{Graphic summary and closing remarks}

In Figure~\ref{fig:Overview-of-results}, we describe the relationships between the main concepts used in the paper.
\input{Relation-graph}

In this work, we have shown that quadratic Lyapunov functions are a natural Lyapunov function concept to study the 
$L^2$-ISS of linear analytic systems in Hilbert spaces.
Under assumption that $A$ generates an analytic semigroup that is similar to a contraction, and if $B\in L(U,X_{-\frac{1}{2}+p})$ for $p>0$, we give an explicit construction of a coercive $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for such a system. If $A$ is self-adjoint, then this function is just $V(x)=\|x\|^{2}$, and is a coercive $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function under a milder assumption
that $B\in L(U,X_{-\frac{1}{2}})$. 
Note that if $B$ is not 2-admissible, then no quadratic $L^p$-ISS Lyapunov function can be constructed for this system.
Hence non-quadratic Lyapunov functions should be considered.

%\textbf{Heat equation with Dirichlet boundary input.} 
One of interesting open problems is whether the heat equation with Dirichlet boundary input (which is an ISS system) possesses a coercive ISS Lyapunov function. Although this question is outside of the scope of this paper, our results do shed some light on this problem. 
In particular, it is well-known that the Dirichlet input operator for the heat equation is not 2-admissible, in fact, it is only $p$-admissible for $p>4$, see e.g.\ \cite{JPP14} and \cite{Preussler23}. This clearly implies that there is no coercive $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for this system, and Proposition~\ref{prop:Restrictions-quadratic-LFs} indicates that there is also no coercive quadratic $L^p$-ISS Lyapunov function for any finite $p$. Thus, if there is a coercive ISS Lyapunov function for this system, then it very likely not  quadratic.
Recall, that Neumann input operator for the heat equation is $\frac{4}{3}$-admissible, see e.g.\ \cite[Ex.~2.14]{Sch20} or \cite[Thm.~3.2]{JPP14}. 
By Lemma~\ref{lem:Sufficient-condition-for-admissibility}, it belongs to $L(U,X_{-\frac{1}{2}})$, and Proposition~\ref{prop:Coercive-LF-Self-adjoint} 
shows that $x\mapsto \|x\|^2$ is an $L^2$-ISS Lyapunov function for the heat equation with the Neumann boundary input (which was also verified directly in \cite{ZhZ18} and \cite{Sch20}).

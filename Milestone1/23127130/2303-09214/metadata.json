    "abstract": "Quasi-brittle materials endowed with (statistically) self-similar hierarcical microstructures show distinct failure patterns that deviate from the standard scenario of damage accumulation followed by crack nucleation-and-growth. Here we study the failure of paper sheets with hierarchical slice patterns as well as non-hierarchical and unpatterned reference samples, considering both uncracked samples and samples containing a macroscopic crack. Failure is studied under displacement-controlled tensile loading as well as under creep conditions. Acoustic emission records and surface strain patterns are recorded alongside stress-strain and creep curves. The measurements demonstrate that hierarchical patterning efficiently mitigates against strain localization and crack propagation. In tensile loading, this results in a significantly increased residual strength of cracked samples. Under creep conditions, for a given range of lifetimes hierarchically patterned samples are found to sustain larger creep strains at higher stress levels; their creep curves show unusual behavior characterized by multiple creep rate minima due to the repeated arrest of emergent localization bands.",

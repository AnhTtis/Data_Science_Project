\begin{remark}\label{rem:sign}
The maximal Levine--Tristram signature, see \eqref{eqn:sigmahat} in \cref{sec:proofs}, provides a good computable lower bound for $\gtop$:
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\sigma}(K) = \underset{\omega \in S^1 \backslash \Delta_K^{-1}(0)}{\operatorname{max}} \left \vert \sigma_\omega(K) \right \vert \leq \gtop(K).
\end{align*}
The function $S^1 \to \Z$, $\omega\mapsto \sigma_{\omega}(K)$,
is piecewise constant and jumps only at zeroes of the Alexander polynomial $\Delta_K$. A priori, its maximum absolute value may be assumed anywhere on $S^1$.

In the above examples and \Cref{prop:braidposbound} 
we have seen that for certain families of $3$-braid knots, $\widehat{\sigma} = |\sigma| = 2\gtop$,
where $\sigma = \sigma_{-1} = \sigma_{e^{\pi i}}$ is the classical knot signature.
This also holds for the $T(3,3k+m)$ torus knots with $m\in\{1,2\}$ and odd $k\geq 1$ \cite{BBL}.
For even~$k$ on the other hand, e.g.~for $T(3,7)$,
one finds $\widehat{\sigma } = |\sigma_{\omega}| = |\sigma| + 2$
for $\omega$ chosen only one jump-point of the Levine--Tristram signature away from $e^{\pi i}$,
i.e.~$\omega = e^{2 \pi i t}$ for
\[ t \in \left(\frac12 - \frac5{18k + 6m},\ \frac12 - \frac1{18k + 6m}\right). \]
This observation relies on the fact that the jumps of the Levine--Tristram signatures of torus knots
are well understood~\cite{Lit, Ban}.
We have also seen examples where $\hatsigma = \sigma_{\zeta3}$, namely the closure of $(abx)^{2k} abx^2abx^2$ for $k \geq 0$; see the proof of \Cref{thm:2} in \Cref{sec:proofs}.
Overall, whenever we could precisely determine the topological 4-genus of a 3-braid knot $K$,
then the maximum absolute value of $\sigma_{e^{2 \pi i t}}$ was either assumed at $t = \frac{1}{3}$,
or at $t = \frac{1}{2}$, or close to $t = \frac{1}{2}$.

However, there are $3$-braid knots $K$ for which
$\widehat{\sigma}(K) \geq |\sigma_{\zeta3}(K)| + 4$ and $\widehat{\sigma}(K) \geq |\sigma(K)| + 4$;
see \cref{fig:sigprofile}. In fact, we conjecture that the difference
${\widehat{\sigma}(K) - \max\left(|\sigma_{\zeta3}(K)|, |\sigma(K)|\right)}$ is unbounded for $K$ ranging over closures of 3-braids of the form $\left(a^2b^2\right)^n \left(a^5b^5\right)^m$.
Determining $\widehat{\sigma}$ and $\gtop$ for all 3-braid knots, or even just closures of positive 3-braids, thus appears to be a hard problem.

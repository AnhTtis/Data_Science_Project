    "abstract": "The wavefront set is a fundamental invariant of an admissible representation arising from the Harish-Chandra-Howe local character expansion. In this paper, we give a precise formula for the wavefront set of an irreducible representation of real infinitesimal character in Lusztig's category of unipotent representations. Our formula generalizes the main result of arXiv:2112.14354, where this formula was obtained in the Iwahori-spherical case. We deduce that for any irreducible unipotent representation with real infinitesimal character, the algebraic wavefront set is a singleton, verifying a conjecture of M\\oeglin and Waldspurger.",

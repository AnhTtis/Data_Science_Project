 Observational data are collected under a specific (possibly unfair) behavioral policy, that assigns treatment depending on certain covariates. Due to rapidly increasing possibilities to collect and store large amounts of data, learning optimal decision rules based on observational data is of high interest in many fields such as healthcare \citep{Hamburg.2010} and marketing \citep{Varian.2016}. While there has been extensive work on policy learning from observational data \citep{Athey.2021}, few methods incorporate fairness constraints.

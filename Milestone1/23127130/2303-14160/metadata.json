    "abstract": "We discuss how the incorporation of a cosmological constant affects the perturbative quantization of (effective) Quantum General Relativity. To this end, we derive the gravitational Slavnov--Taylor identities and appropriate renormalization conditions for the cosmological constant. Additionally, we calculate the corresponding Feynman rules for any vertex valence and with general gauge parameter. Furthermore, we provide the BRST setup and generate the Faddeev--Popov ghost and the symmetric ghost via a gauge fixing fermion and a gauge fixing boson, respectively. Finally, we study the transversality of the graviton propagator and the graviton three-valent vertex.",

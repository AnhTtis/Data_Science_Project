    "abstract": "In the recent paper [1], a new method based on measuring a temperature correction to a quantum-oscillation frequency was proposed to study an energy-band dispersion of charge carriers in small Fermi surface (FS) pockets of crystals. To illustrate their approach, Guo et al. [1] applied it to a number of materials and, in particular, to the multiband metal LaRhIn$_5$ which, apart from high-frequency oscillations associated with a large FS, also exhibits the oscillations with the low frequency $F\\approx 7$ T. Although the method of Ref. [1] really detects charge carriers with a linear dispersion, it does not distinguish between the carriers near a Dirac point and near a nodal line, since all such quasiparticles disperse linearly. Here we ask what is the nature of the carriers associated with the frequency $F$ in LaRhIn$_5$ and call attention to the puzzling origin of this frequency.",

    "abstract": "We present the second part of a series of papers proposing a novel teaching sequence for Particle Physics in high school. The topic of the present work is Nuclear Physics. The goal of the sequence is to approach the subject in a way as to stimulate scientific literacy, from a perspective involving Science, Technology, Society and Environment (STSE). We evaluate the potentialities and effectiveness of the material proposed here, allied to a dialogical approach by the teacher, by analyzing the presence of scientific literacy and engagement indicators during interventions applied to a public school in Espírito Santo, Brazil.",

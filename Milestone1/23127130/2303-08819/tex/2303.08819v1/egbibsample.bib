  abstract = {Node-link visualizations are a familiar and powerful tool for displaying the relationships in a network. The readability of these visualizations highly depends on the spatial layout used for the nodes. In this paper, we focus on computing layered layouts, in which nodes are aligned on a set of parallel axes to better expose hierarchical or sequential relationships. Heuristic-based layouts are widely used as they scale well to larger networks and usually create readable, albeit sub-optimal, visualizations. We instead use a layout optimization model that prioritizes optimality – as compared to scalability – because an optimal solution not only represents the best attainable result, but can also serve as a baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of layout heuristics. We take an important step towards powerful and flexible network visualization by proposing STRATISFIMAL LAYOUT, a modular integer-linear-programming formulation that can consider several important readability criteria simultaneously – crossing reduction, edge bendiness, and nested and multi-layer groups. The layout can be adapted to diverse use cases through its modularity. Individual features can be enabled and customized depending on the application. We provide open-source and documented implementations of the layout, both for web-based and desktop visualizations. As a proof-of-concept, we apply it to the problem of visualizing complicated SQL queries, which have features that we believe cannot be addressed by existing layout optimization models. We also include a benchmark network generator and the results of an empirical evaluation to assess the performance trade-offs of our design choices.

abstract = {Graph layout algorithms typically conform to one or more aesthetic criteria (e.g. minimizing the number of bends, maximizing orthogonality). Determining the extent to which a graph drawing conforms to an aesthetic criterion tends to be done informally, and varies between different algorithms. This paper presents formal metrics for measuring the aesthetic presence in a graph drawing for seven common aesthetic criteria, applicable to any graph drawing of any size. The metrics are useful for determining the aesthetic quality of a given graph drawing, or for defining a cost function for genetic algorithms or simulated annealing programs. The metrics are continuous, so that aesthetic quality is not stated as a binary conformance decision (i.e. the drawing either conforms to the aesthetic or not), but can be stated as the extent of aesthetic conformance using a number between 0 and 1. The paper presents the seven metric formulae. The application of these metrics is demonstrated through the aesthetic analysis of example graph drawings produced by common layout algorithms.}

abstract="Symmetry is a key feature observed in nature (from flowers and leaves, to butterflies and birds) and in human-made objects (from paintings and sculptures, to manufactured objects and architectural design). Rotational, translational, and especially reflectional symmetries, are also important in drawings of graphs. Detecting and classifying symmetries can be very useful in algorithms that aim to create symmetric graph drawings and in this paper we present a machine learning approach for these tasks. Specifically, we show that deep neural networks can be used to detect reflectional symmetries with 92{\%} accuracy. We also build a multi-class classifier to distinguish between reflectional horizontal, reflectional vertical, rotational, and translational symmetries. Finally, we make available a collection of images of graph drawings with specific symmetric features that can be used in machine learning systems for training, testing and validation purposes. Our datasets, best trained ML models, source code are available online.",

abstract="This paper addresses the following basic question: given two layouts of the same graph, which one is more aesthetically pleasing? We propose a neural network-based discriminator model trained on a labeled dataset that decides which of two layouts has a higher aesthetic quality. The feature vectors used as inputs to the model are based on known graph drawing quality metrics, classical statistics, information-theoretical quantities, and two-point statistics inspired by methods of condensed matter physics. The large corpus of layout pairs used for training and testing is constructed using force-directed drawing algorithms and the layouts that naturally stem from the process of graph generation. It is further extended using data augmentation techniques. Our model demonstrates a mean prediction accuracy of 96.48{\%}, outperforming discriminators based on stress and on the linear combination of popular quality metrics by a small but statistically significant margin.",

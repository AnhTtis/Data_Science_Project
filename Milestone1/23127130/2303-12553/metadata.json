    "abstract": "We construct germs of complex manifolds of dimension $m$ along projective submanifolds of dimension $n$ with ample normal bundle and without non-constant meromorphic functions whenever $m \\geq 2n$. We also show that our methods do not allow the construction of similar examples when $m < 2n$ by establishing an algebraicity criterion for foliations on projective spaces which generalizes a classical result by Van den Ven characterizing linear subspaces of projective spaces as the only submanifolds with split tangent sequence.",

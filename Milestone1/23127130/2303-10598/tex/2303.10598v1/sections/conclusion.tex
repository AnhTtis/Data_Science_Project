\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present StyleRF, a novel zero-shot 3D style transfer method that balances the three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. By representing the 3D scene with an explicit grid of high-level features, we can faithfully restore high-fidelity geometry through volume rendering. Then we perform style transfer on the feature space of the scene, leading to high-quality zero-shot stylization results. We innovatively design sampling-invariant content transformation to maintain multiview consistency and deferred style transformation to increase efficiency. We demonstrate that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality than previous zero-shot 3D style transfer methods, and can be extended to various interesting applications for artistic 3D creations.

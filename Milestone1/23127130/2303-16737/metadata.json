    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used as aerial base stations to provide ad hoc communications infrastructure. Building upon prior research efforts which consider either static nodes, 2D trajectories or single UAV systems, this paper focuses on the use of multiple UAVs for providing wireless communication to mobile users in the absence of terrestrial communications infrastructure. In particular, we jointly optimize UAV 3D trajectory and NOMA power allocation to maximize system throughput. Firstly, a weighted K-means-based clustering algorithm establishes UAV-user associations at regular intervals. The efficacy of training a novel Shared Deep Q-Network (SDQN) with action masking is then explored. Unlike training each UAV separately using DQN, the SDQN reduces training time by using the experiences of multiple UAVs instead of a single agent. We also show that SDQN can be used to train a multi-agent system with differing action spaces. Simulation results confirm that: 1) training a shared DQN outperforms a conventional DQN in terms of maximum system throughput (+20%) and training time (-10%); 2) it can converge for agents with different action spaces, yielding a 9% increase in throughput compared to mutual learning algorithms; and 3) combining NOMA with an SDQN architecture enables the network to achieve a better sum rate compared with existing baseline schemes.",

\begin{abstract}
	In literature, the cost of a partitioned fluid-structure interaction scheme is typically assessed by the number of coupling iterations required per time step, while ignoring the internal iterations within the nonlinear subproblems.
 % 
	In this work, we demonstrate that these internal iterations have a significant influence on the computational cost of the coupled simulation.
 % 
    Particular attention is paid to how limiting the number of iterations within each solver call
    can shorten the overall run time, as it avoids polishing the subproblem solution using
    unconverged coupling data.
    %Particular focus is put on how limiting the number of iterations within each solver call
    %can reduce the overall run time, as it avoids overfitting the subproblem solution to
    %unconverged coupling data.
% 
    Based on systematic parameter studies, we investigate the optimal number of \subproblemIter s per coupling step.
    % 
    % Note that most of the findings are expected to hold true for any multi-field problem
    % solved by a partitioned algorithm.
    % and investigate the optimal number of iterations per solver call.

	Lastly, this work proposes a new convergence criterion for coupled systems that is based on the residuals of the subproblems and therefore does not require any additional convergence tolerance for the coupling loop.

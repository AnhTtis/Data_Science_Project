\section{Conclusion}

We have unveiled the challenges of the task text-to-3D directly using latent-based NeRFs and the limitations of the current models for this task. We propose a framework named 3D-CLFusion, which aims to produce view-invariant latent for rendering 3D objects with NeRFs from the input text prompt. Compared with the existing baseline models in the experiments, our designed model achieves more effective text-to-3D with pre-trained NeRFs. Though the 3D object created by our model is domain-specific to the pre-trained model, the inference time is at least 100 times faster than the existing text-to-3D creation from neural rendering. We would like to note that, our model will be applicable in the real world if more pre-trained NeRFs with vast categories of 3D objects are available.
% We will update the results for more categories in the next version.

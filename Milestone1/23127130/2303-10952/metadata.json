    "abstract": "The spectroheliograph is a spectroscopic instrument designed to produce monochromatic images of the photosphere (the visible layer) and the chromosphere of the Sun. It was invented at the same time (1892), but independently, by Hale in the USA and Deslandres in France and was dedicated to long-term surveys of the solar cycles. For that purpose, systematic observations of the CaII K and H$α$ lines started in Meudon observatory in 1908 and continue today, so that a huge collection of more than 100000 spectroheliograms, spanning 115 years of solar activity, was recorded. We present in this paper the optical characteristics and the capabilities of the successive versions of the instrument, from 1908 to now.",
